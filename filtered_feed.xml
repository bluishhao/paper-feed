Abstract: Research on adversarial robustness in language models is currently fragmented across applications and attacks, obscuring shared vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose unifying the study of adversarial robustness in text scoring models spanning dense retrievers, rerankers, and reward models. This motivates adapting both attacks and adversarial training methods across model roles. Unlike open-ended generation, text scoring failures are directly testable: an attack succeeds when an irrelevant or rejected text outscores a relevant or chosen one. Using this principled lens of text scoring, we demonstrate that current adversarial training formulations for language models are often short-sighted, failing to effectively generalize across attacks. To address this, we introduce multiple adversarial training methods for text scoring models and show that combining complementary training methods can yield strong robustness while also improving task effectiveness. We also highlight the practical value of our approach for RLHF, showing that our adversarially trained reward models mitigate reward hacking and support the training of better-aligned LLMs. We provide our code and models for further study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00857v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReACT-TTC: Capacity-Aware Top Trading Cycles for Post-Choice Reassignment in Shared CPS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00859</link><description>arXiv:2602.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) increasingly manage shared physical resources in the presence of human decision-making, where system-assigned actions must be executed by users or agents in the physical world. A fundamental challenge in such settings is user non-compliance: individuals may deviate from assigned resources due to personal preferences or local information, degrading system efficiency and requiring light-weight reassignment schemes. This paper proposes a post-deviation reassignment framework for shared-resource CPS that operates on top of any initial allocation algorithm and is invoked only when users diverge from prescribed assignments. We advance the Top-Trading-Cycle (TTC) mechanism to enable voluntary, preference-driven exchanges after deviation events, and extend it to handle many-to-one resource capacities and unassigned resource conditions that are not supported by the classical TTC. We formalize these structural cases, introduce capacity-aware cycle-detection rules, and prove termination along with the preservation of Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness. A Prospect-Theoretic (PT) preference model is further incorporated to capture realistic user satisfaction behavior. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework on an electric-vehicle (EV) charging case study using real-world data, where it increases user satisfaction and effective assignment quality under non-compliant behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00859v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Head Attention Is a Multi-Player Game</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00861</link><description>arXiv:2602.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern transformer attention is internally multi-agent -- heads compete and coordinate -- yet we train it as if it were a monolithic optimizer. We formalize this gap: cross-entropy training induces an implicit potential game among heads, and gradient descent converges to Nash equilibria with potentially unbounded inefficiency due to unpriced externalities (redundancy, correlated errors). Our main result bounds the Price of Anarchy by $\Gamma(G)$, the off-diagonal mass of a head interaction matrix capturing weight and gradient coupling. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we prove that both \emph{excess hallucination probability} and \emph{excess head redundancy} scale with PoA, unifying two distinct failure modes into a single mechanism. The bound is prescriptive: regularization that reduces $\Gamma(G)$ provably tightens PoA. We instantiate this as GAME-LoRA, combining Barlow Twins decorrelation with log-determinant coordination pressure. Experiments validate the theory: $\Gamma(G)$ predicts hallucination ($p{&lt;}0.05$), emergent coalitions exhibit selective coordination, and GAME-LoRA achieves up to 18\% hallucination reduction (8\% average) with no knowledge degradation -- a Pareto improvement inaccessible to methods ignoring the game structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00861v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Multiscale Graph-based Protein Learning with Geometric Secondary Structural Motifs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00862</link><description>arXiv:2602.00862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning protein structures by capturing spatial relationships at the residue level. However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $\alpha$-helices, $\beta$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information. Empirically, we demonstrate that integrating baseline GNNs into our multiscale framework remarkably improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational cost across various benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00862v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distill3R: A Pipeline for Democratizing 3D Foundation Models on Commodity Hardware</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00865</link><description>arXiv:2602.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multi-view 3D reconstruction has shifted toward large-scale foundation models capable of inferring globally consistent geometry, their reliance on massive computational clusters for training has created a significant barrier to entry for most academic laboratories. To bridge this compute divide, we introduce Distill3R, a framework designed to distill the geometric reasoning of 3D foundation models into compact students fully trainable on a single workstation. Our methodology centers on two primary innovations: (1) an offline caching pipeline that decouples heavy teacher inference from the training loop through compressed supervision signals, and (2) a confidence-aware distillation loss that leverages teacher uncertainty to enable training on commodity hardware. We propose a 72M-parameter student model which achieves a 9x reduction in parameters and a 5x inference speedup compared to its 650M-parameter teacher. The student is fully trainable in under 3 days on a single workstation, whereas its teacher requires massive GPU clusters for up to a week. We demonstrate that the student preserves the structural consistency and qualitative geometric understanding required for functional 3D awareness. By providing a reproducible, single-workstation training recipe, Distill3R serves as an exploratory entry point for democratized 3D vision research and efficient edge deployment. This work is not intended to compete with state-of-the-art foundation models, but to provide an accessible research baseline for laboratories without access to large-scale compute to train and specialize models on their own domain-specific data at minimal cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00865v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Foundation CAN LM: A Pretrained Language Model For Automotive CAN Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00866</link><description>arXiv:2602.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus provides a rich source of vehicular signals increasingly leveraged for applications in automotive and auto insurance domains, including collision detection, predictive maintenance, and driver risk modeling. Despite this potential, existing pipelines largely train isolated task-specific models on raw CAN data, with only limited efforts exploring decoded signals. Such fragmentation prevents shared representation learning and limits cross-task generalization. By contrast, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have been transformed by the foundation model paradigm: large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific adaptation. In this work, we introduce the foundation CAN model that demonstrates multi-objective downstream generalization using a single pretrained backbone. Our approach treats CAN data as a language: we pretrain on large-scale, unlabeled decoded CAN signals and fine-tune across heterogeneous auto insurance tasks. To enable this, we propose a unified tokenization scheme for mixed discrete-continuous signals and address challenges of temporal complexity and trip-specific variability. Our results show that one pretrained CAN model can adapt effectively to diverse predictive tasks, validating that the foundation modeling paradigm, proven in NLP and CV, also holds for CAN data. This establishes a new direction for generalizable representation learning in automotive AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00866v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Safe Stochastic Explorer: Enabling Safe Goal Driven Exploration in Stochastic Environments and Safe Interaction with Unknown Objects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00868</link><description>arXiv:2602.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robots operating in unstructured, safety-critical environments, from planetary exploration to warehouses and homes, must learn to safely navigate and interact with their surroundings despite limited prior knowledge. Current methods for safe control, such as Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability and Control Barrier Functions, assume known system dynamics. Meanwhile existing safe exploration techniques often fail to account for the unavoidable stochasticity inherent when operating in unknown real world environments, such as an exploratory rover skidding over an unseen surface or a household robot pushing around unmapped objects in a pantry. To address this critical gap, we propose Safe Stochastic Explorer (S.S.Explorer) a novel framework for safe, goal-driven exploration under stochastic dynamics. Our approach strategically balances safety and information gathering to reduce uncertainty about safety in the unknown environment. We employ Gaussian Processes to learn the unknown safety function online, leveraging their predictive uncertainty to guide information-gathering actions and provide probabilistic bounds on safety violations. We first present our method for discrete state space environments and then introduce a scalable relaxation to effectively extend this approach to continuous state spaces. Finally we demonstrate how this framework can be naturally applied to ensure safe physical interaction with multiple unknown objects. Extensive validation in simulation and demonstrative hardware experiments showcase the efficacy of our method, representing a step forward toward enabling reliable widespread robot autonomy in complex, uncertain environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00868v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Flow Matching by Aligning Flow Divergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00869</link><description>arXiv:2602.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) stands out as an efficient, simulation-free approach for training flow-based generative models, achieving remarkable performance for data generation. However, CFM is insufficient to ensure accuracy in learning probability paths. In this paper, we introduce a new partial differential equation characterization for the error between the learned and exact probability paths, along with its solution. We show that the total variation gap between the two probability paths is bounded above by a combination of the CFM loss and an associated divergence loss. This theoretical insight leads to the design of a new objective function that simultaneously matches the flow and its divergence. Our new approach improves the performance of the flow-based generative model by a noticeable margin without sacrificing generation efficiency. We showcase the advantages of this enhanced training approach over CFM on several important benchmark tasks, including generative modeling for dynamical systems, DNA sequences, and videos.

Abstract: Neural operators aim to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, but their performance often degrades on complex or irregular geometries due to the lack of geometry-aware representations. We propose the Finite Element Eigenfunction Network (FEENet), a hybrid spectral learning framework grounded in the eigenfunction theory of differential operators. For a given domain, FEENet leverages the Finite Element Method (FEM)toperformaone-timecomputationofaneigenfunctionbasisintrinsictothegeometry. PDE solutions are subsequently represented in this geometry-adapted basis, and learning is reduced to predicting the corresponding spectral coefficients. Numerical experiments conducted across a range of parameterized PDEs and complex two- and three-dimensional geometries, including benchmarks against the seminal DeepONet framework (1), demonstrate that FEENet consistently achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency. We further highlight key advantages of the proposed approach, including resolution-independent inference, interpretability, and natural generalization to nonlocal operators defined as functions of differential operators. We envision that hybrid approaches of this form, which combine structure-preserving numerical methods with data-driven learning, offer a promising pathway toward solving real-world PDE problems on complex geometries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00870v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Output Critique: Self-Correction via Task Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00871</link><description>arXiv:2602.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising self-correction abilities, where iterative refinement improves the quality of generated responses. However, most existing approaches operate at the level of output critique, patching surface errors while often failing to correct deeper reasoning flaws. We propose SELF-THOUGHT, a framework that introduces an intermediate step of task abstraction before solution refinement. Given an input and an initial response, the model first distills the task into a structured template that captures key variables, constraints, and problem structure. This abstraction then guides solution instantiation, grounding subsequent responses in a clearer understanding of the task and reducing error propagation. Crucially, we show that these abstractions can be transferred across models: templates generated by larger models can serve as structured guides for smaller LLMs, which typically struggle with intrinsic self-correction. By reusing distilled task structures, smaller models achieve more reliable refinements without heavy fine-tuning or reliance on external verifiers. Experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that SELF-THOUGHT improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization for both large and small models, offering a scalable path toward more reliable self-correcting language systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00871v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning When to Jump for Off-road Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00877</link><description>arXiv:2602.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low speed does not always guarantee safety in off-road driving. For instance, crossing a ditch may be risky at a low speed due to the risk of getting stuck, yet safe at a higher speed with a controlled, accelerated jump. Achieving such behavior requires path planning that explicitly models complex motion dynamics, whereas existing methods often neglect this aspect and plan solely based on positions or a fixed velocity. To address this gap, we introduce Motion-aware Traversability (MAT) representation to explicitly model terrain cost conditioned on actual robot motion. Instead of assigning a single scalar score for traversability, MAT models each terrain region as a Gaussian function of velocity. During online planning, we decompose the terrain cost computation into two stages: (1) predict terrain-dependent Gaussian parameters from perception in a single forward pass, (2) efficiently update terrain costs for new velocities inferred from current dynamics by evaluating these functions without repeated inference. We develop a system that integrates MAT to enable agile off-road navigation and evaluate it in both simulated and real-world environments with various obstacles. Results show that MAT achieves real-time efficiency and enhances the performance of off-road navigation, reducing path detours by 75% while maintaining safety across challenging terrains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00877v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Expert Sharing: Decoupling Memory from Parallelism in Mixture-of-Experts Diffusion LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00879</link><description>arXiv:2602.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among parallel decoding paradigms, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising candidate that balances generation quality and throughput. However, their integration with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures is constrained by an expert explosion: as the number of tokens generated in parallel increases, the number of distinct experts activated grows nearly linearly. This results in substantial memory traffic that pushes inference into a memory-bound regime, negating the efficiency gains of both MoE and parallel decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Expert Sharing (DES), a novel technique that shifts MoE optimization from token-centric pruning and conventional expert skipping methods to sequence-level coreset selection. To maximize expert reuse, DES identifies a compact, high-utility set of experts to satisfy the requirements of an entire parallel decoding block. We introduce two innovative selection strategies: (1) Intra-Sequence Sharing (DES-Seq), which adapts optimal allocation to the sequence level, and (2) Saliency-Aware Voting (DES-Vote), a novel mechanism that allows tokens to collectively elect a coreset based on aggregated router weights. Extensive experiments on MoE dLLMs demonstrate that DES reduces unique expert activations by over 55% and latency by up to 38%, while retaining 99% of vanilla accuracy, effectively decoupling memory overhead from the degree of parallelism.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00879v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sensing What Surveys Miss: Understanding and Personalizing Proactive LLM Support by User Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00880</link><description>arXiv:2602.00880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Difficulty spillover and suboptimal help-seeking challenge the sequential, knowledge-intensive nature of digital tasks. In online surveys, tough questions can drain mental energy and hurt performance on later questions, while users often fail to recognize when they need assistance or may satisfy, lacking motivation to seek help. We developed a proactive, adaptive system using electrodermal activity and mouse movement to predict when respondents need support. Personalized classifiers with a rule-based threshold adaptation trigger timely LLM-based clarifications and explanations. In a within-subjects study (N=32), aligned-adaptive timing was compared to misaligned-adaptive and random-adaptive controls. Aligned-adaptive assistance improved response accuracy by 21%, reduced false negative rates from 50.9% to 22.9%, and improved perceived efficiency, dependability, and benevolence. Properly timed interventions prevent cascades of degraded responses, showing that aligning support with cognitive states improves both the outcomes and the user experience. This enables more effective, personalized LLM-assisted support in survey-based research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ILSIC: Corpora for Identifying Indian Legal Statutes from Queries by Laypeople</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00881</link><description>arXiv:2602.00881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal Statute Identification (LSI) for a given situation is one of the most fundamental tasks in Legal NLP. This task has traditionally been modeled using facts from court judgments as input queries, due to their abundance. However, in practical settings, the input queries are likely to be informal and asked by laypersons, or non-professionals. While a few laypeople LSI datasets exist, there has been little research to explore the differences between court and laypeople data for LSI. In this work, we create ILSIC, a corpus of laypeople queries covering 500+ statutes from Indian law. Additionally, the corpus also contains court case judgements to enable researchers to effectively compare between court and laypeople data for LSI. We conducted extensive experiments on our corpus, including benchmarking over the laypeople dataset using zero and few-shot inference, retrieval-augmented generation and supervised fine-tuning. We observe that models trained purely on court judgements are ineffective during test on laypeople queries, while transfer learning from court to laypeople data can be beneficial in certain scenarios. We also conducted fine-grained analyses of our results in terms of categories of queries and frequency of statutes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00881v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DIAMOND: Directed Inference for Artifact Mitigation in Flow Matching Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00883</link><description>arXiv:2602.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite impressive results from recent text-to-image models like FLUX, visual and anatomical artifacts remain a significant hurdle for practical and professional use. Existing methods for artifact reduction, typically work in a post-hoc manner, consequently failing to intervene effectively during the core image formation process. Notably, current techniques require problematic and invasive modifications to the model weights, or depend on a computationally expensive and time-consuming process of regional refinement. To address these limitations, we propose DIAMOND, a training-free method that applies trajectory correction to mitigate artifacts during inference. By reconstructing an estimate of the clean sample at every step of the generative trajectory, DIAMOND actively steers the generation process away from latent states that lead to artifacts. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to standard Diffusion Models, demonstrating that DIAMOND provides a robust, zero-shot path to high-fidelity, artifact-free image synthesis without the need for additional training or weight modifications in modern generative architectures.

Abstract: Neural operators have shown promise in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but they often struggle to generalize when test inputs lie outside the training distribution, such as novel initial conditions, unseen PDE coefficients or unseen physics. Prior works address this limitation with large-scale multiple physics pretraining followed by fine-tuning, but this still requires examples from the new dynamics, falling short of true zero-shot generalization. In this work, we propose a method to enhance generalization at test time, i.e., without modifying pretrained weights. Building on DISCO, which provides a dictionary of neural operators trained across different dynamics, we introduce a neural operator splitting strategy that, at test time, searches over compositions of training operators to approximate unseen dynamics. On challenging out-of-distribution tasks including parameter extrapolation and novel combinations of physics phenomena, our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization results, while being able to recover the underlying PDE parameters. These results underscore test-time computation as a key avenue for building flexible, compositional, and generalizable neural operators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00884v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reliability-Aware Determinantal Point Processes for Robust Informative Data Selection in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00885</link><description>arXiv:2602.00885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informative data selection is a key requirement for large language models (LLMs) to minimize the amount of data required for fine-tuning, network distillation, and token pruning, enabling fast and efficient deployment, especially under computational and communication constraints. Traditional subset selection methods, including those based on Determinantal Point Processes (DPP), focus on maximizing diversity but assume that selected data batches are always available error-free. This presumption prohibits their use under partial storage outage, imperfect communication, and stochastic access failures. Furthermore, we show that the original formulation collapses under such conditions. To address this gap, we introduce ProbDPP, a novel reliability-aware implementation of k-DPP that accounts for probabilistic data access by recasting the objective function with a regularization term that remains well-posed and decomposes into a geometric diversity term and unreliability cost. The resulting objective facilitates robust selection of diverse data batches under uncertainty. Furthermore, we frame this reliability-aware diversity maximization as a combinatorial semi-bandit problem and propose a UCB-style algorithm to efficiently learn the unknown reliability online. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds for the proposed approach, ensuring performance guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00885v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EffGen: Enabling Small Language Models as Capable Autonomous Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00887</link><description>arXiv:2602.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing language model agentic systems today are built and optimized for large language models (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini) via API calls. While powerful, this approach faces several limitations including high token costs and privacy concerns for sensitive applications. We introduce effGen, an open-source agentic framework optimized for small language models (SLMs) that enables effective, efficient, and secure local deployment (pip install effgen). effGen makes four major contributions: (1) Enhanced tool-calling with prompt optimization that compresses contexts by 70-80% while preserving task semantics, (2) Intelligent task decomposition that breaks complex queries into parallel or sequential subtasks based on dependencies, (3) Complexity-based routing using five factors to make smart pre-execution decisions, and (4) Unified memory system combining short-term, long-term, and vector-based storage. Additionally, effGen unifies multiple agent protocols (MCP, A2A, ACP) for cross-protocol communication. Results on 13 benchmarks show effGen outperforms LangChain, AutoGen, and Smolagents with higher success rates, faster execution, and lower memory. Our results reveal that prompt optimization and complexity routing have complementary scaling behavior: optimization benefits SLMs more (11.2% gain at 1.5B vs 2.4% at 32B), while routing benefits large models more (3.6% at 1.5B vs 7.9% at 32B), providing consistent gains across all scales when combined. effGen (https://effgen.org/) is released under the MIT License, ensuring broad accessibility for research and commercial use.

Abstract: The advent of the web has led to a paradigm shift in the financial relations, with the real-time dissemination of news, social discourse, and financial filings contributing significantly to the reshaping of financial forecasting. The existing methods rely on establishing relations a priori, i.e. predefining graphs to capture inter-stock relationships. However, the stock-related web signals are characterised by high levels of noise, asynchrony, and challenging to obtain, resulting in poor generalisability and non-alignment between the predefined graphs and the downstream tasks. To address this, we propose GAPNet, a Graph Adaptation Plug-in Network that jointly learns task-specific topology and representations in an end-to-end manner. GAPNet attaches to existing pairwise graph or hypergraph backbone models, enabling the dynamic adaptation and rewiring of edge topologies via two complementary components: a Spatial Perception Layer that captures short-term co-movements across assets, and a Temporal Perception Layer that maintains long-term dependency under distribution shift. Across two real-world stock datasets, GAPNet has been shown to consistently enhance the profitability and stability in comparision to the state-of-the-art models, yielding annualised cumulative returns of up to 0.47 for RT-GCN and 0.63 for CI-STHPAN, with peak Sharpe Ratio of 2.20 and 2.12 respectively. The plug-and-play design of GAPNet ensures its broad applicability to diverse GNN-based architectures. Our results underscore that jointly learning graph structures and representations is essential for task-specific relational modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00888v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] System-Level Performance Modeling of Photonic In-Memory Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00892</link><description>arXiv:2602.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic in-memory computing is a high-speed, low-energy alternative to traditional transistor-based digital computing that utilizes high photonic operating frequencies and bandwidths. In this work, we develop a comprehensive system-level performance model for photonic in-memory computing, capturing the effects of key latency sources such as external memory access and opto-electronic conversion. We perform algorithm-to-hardware mapping across a range of workloads, including the Sod shock tube problem, Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Product (MTTKRP), and the Vlasov-Maxwell equation, to evaluate how the latencies impact real-world high-performance computing workloads. Our performance model shows that, while accounting for system overheads, a compact 1x256 bit single-wavelength photonic SRAM array, fabricated using the standard silicon photonics process by GlobalFoundries, sustains up to 1.5 TOPS, 0.9 TOPS, and 1.3 TOPS on the Sod shock tube problem, MTTKRP, and the Vlasov-Maxwell equation with an average energy efficiency of 2.5 TOPS/W.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00892v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A New Combination of Preconditioned Gradient Descent Methods and Vector Extrapolation Techniques for Nonlinear Least-Squares Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00897</link><description>arXiv:2602.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector extrapolation methods are widely used in large-scale simulation studies, and numerous extrapolation-based acceleration techniques have been developed to enhance the convergence of linear and nonlinear fixed-point iterative methods. While classical extrapolation strategies often reduce the number of iterations or the computational cost, they do not necessarily lead to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the computed approximations. In this paper, we study the combination of preconditioned gradient-based methods with extrapolation strategies and propose an extrapolation-accelerated framework that simultaneously improves convergence and approximation accuracy. The focus is on the solution of nonlinear least-squares problems through the integration of vector extrapolation techniques with preconditioned gradient descent methods. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments is carried out to study the behavior of polynomial-type extrapolation methods and the vector $\varepsilon$-algorithm when coupled with gradient descent schemes, with and without preconditioning. The results demonstrate the impact of extrapolation techniques on both convergence rate and solution accuracy, and report iteration counts, computational times, and relative reconstruction errors. The performance of the proposed hybrid approaches is further assessed through a benchmarking study against Gauss--Newton methods based on generalized Krylov subspaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00897v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Domain-Adaptive and Scalable Dense Retrieval for Content-Based Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00899</link><description>arXiv:2602.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce recommendation and search commonly rely on sparse keyword matching (e.g., BM25), which breaks down under vocabulary mismatch when user intent has limited lexical overlap with product metadata. We cast content-based recommendation as recommendation-as-retrieval: given a natural-language intent signal (a query or review), retrieve the top-K most relevant items from a large catalog via semantic similarity.
  We present a scalable dense retrieval system based on a two-tower bi-encoder, fine-tuned on the Amazon Reviews 2023 (Fashion) subset using supervised contrastive learning with Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss. We construct training pairs from review text (as a query proxy) and item metadata (as the positive document) and fine-tune on 50,000 sampled interactions with a maximum sequence length of 500 tokens.
  For efficient serving, we combine FAISS HNSW indexing with an ONNX Runtime inference pipeline using INT8 dynamic quantization. On a review-to-title benchmark over 826,402 catalog items, our approach improves Recall@10 from 0.26 (BM25) to 0.66, while meeting practical latency and model-size constraints: 6.1 ms median CPU inference latency (batch size 1) and a 4x reduction in model size.
  Overall, we provide an end-to-end, reproducible blueprint for taking domain-adapted dense retrieval from offline training to CPU-efficient serving at catalog scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OCTOPUS: Enhancing the Spatial-Awareness of Vision SSMs with Multi-Dimensional Scans and Traversal Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00904</link><description>arXiv:2602.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to transformers due to their unique ability of modeling global relationships in text with linear complexity. However, their success in vision tasks has been limited due to their causal formulation, which is suitable for sequential text but detrimental in the spatial domain where causality breaks the inherent spatial relationships among pixels or patches. As a result, standard SSMs fail to capture local spatial coherence, often linking non-adjacent patches while ignoring neighboring ones that are visually correlated. To address these limitations, we introduce OCTOPUS , a novel architecture that preserves both global context and local spatial structure within images, while maintaining the linear complexity of SSMs. OCTOPUS performs discrete reoccurrence along eight principal orientations, going forward or backward in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, allowing effective information exchange across all spatially connected regions while maintaining independence among unrelated patches. This design enables multi-directional recurrence, capturing both global context and local spatial structure with SSM-level efficiency. In our classification and segmentation benchmarks, OCTOPUS demonstrates notable improvements in boundary preservation and region consistency, as evident from the segmentation results, while maintaining relatively better classification accuracy compared to existing V-SSM based models. These results suggest that OCTOPUS appears as a foundation method for multi-directional recurrence as a scalable and effective mechanism for building spatially aware and computationally efficient vision architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00904v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Energy Shaping Control of an Underactuated Inverted Pendulum</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00905</link><description>arXiv:2602.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the stabilization of underactuated systems remains a challenging problem, the total energy shaping approach provides a general framework for addressing this objective. However, the practical implementation of this method is hindered by the need to analytically solve a set of partial differential equations (PDEs), which constitutes a major obstacle. In this paper, a rotary inverted pendulum system is considered, and an interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) scheme is developed by deriving concise analytical solutions to the kinetic and potential energy PDEs. Furthermore, a novel robust term is incorporated into the control law to compensate for a specific class of disturbances that has not been addressed within the existing IDA-PBC literature. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating satisfactory control performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00905v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hallucination is a Consequence of Space-Optimality: A Rate-Distortion Theorem for Membership Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00906</link><description>arXiv:2602.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PyGALAX: An Open-Source Python Toolkit for Advanced Explainable Geospatial Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00907</link><description>arXiv:2602.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PyGALAX is a Python package for geospatial analysis that integrates automated machine learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to analyze spatial heterogeneity in both regression and classification tasks. It automatically selects and optimizes machine learning models for different geographic locations and contexts while maintaining interpretability through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. PyGALAX builds upon and improves the GALAX framework (Geospatial Analysis Leveraging AutoML and eXplainable AI), which has proven to outperform traditional geographically weighted regression (GWR) methods. Critical enhancements in PyGALAX from the original GALAX framework include automatic bandwidth selection and flexible kernel function selection, providing greater flexibility and robustness for spatial modeling across diverse datasets and research questions. PyGALAX not only inherits all the functionalities of the original GALAX framework but also packages them into an accessible, reproducible, and easily deployable Python toolkit while providing additional options for spatial modeling. It effectively addresses spatial non-stationarity and generates transparent insights into complex spatial relationships at both global and local scales, making advanced geospatial machine learning methods accessible to researchers and practitioners in geography, urban planning, environmental science, and related fields.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00907v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reduction of Velocity-Dependent Terms in Total Energy Shaping Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00908</link><description>arXiv:2602.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total energy shaping through interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) provides a powerful and systematic framework for stabilizing underactuated mechanical systems. Despite its theoretical appeal, incorporating actuator limitations into total energy shaping remains a largely open problem, with only limited results reported in the existing literature. In practice, the closed-loop behavior of energy-shaping controllers is strongly affected by the kinetic energy shaping terms. In this paper, a simultaneous IDA-PBC (SIDA-PBC) framework is employed to systematically attenuate the kinetic energy shaping terms by exploiting generalized forces, without altering the matching partial differential equations (PDEs). The free component of the generalized forces is derived analytically via an $\ell_\infty$-norm optimization formulation. Although a reduction in kinetic energy shaping terms does not necessarily guarantee a decrease in the overall control effort, the proposed approach effectively suppresses kinetic energy shaping components and achieves a reduced control magnitude whenever such a reduction is structurally feasible. Unlike existing approaches based on gyroscopic terms, which require multiple actuators, the proposed method is applicable to mechanical systems with a single actuator. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ENFOR-SA: End-to-end Cross-layer Transient Fault Injector for Efficient and Accurate DNN Reliability Assessment on Systolic Arrays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00909</link><description>arXiv:2602.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have produced highly accurate but increasingly large and complex DNNs, making traditional fault-injection techniques impractical. Accurate fault analysis requires RTL-accurate hardware models. However, this significantly slows evaluation compared with software-only approaches, particularly when combined with expensive HDL instrumentation. In this work, we show that such high-overhead methods are unnecessary for systolic array (SA) architectures and propose ENFOR-SA, an end-to-end framework for DNN transient fault analysis on SAs. Our two-step approach employs cross-layer simulation and uses RTL SA components only during fault injection, with the rest executed at the software level. Experiments on CNNs and Vision Transformers demonstrate that ENFOR-SA achieves RTL-accurate fault injection with only 6% average slowdown compared to software-based injection, while delivering at least two orders of magnitude speedup (average $569\times$) over full-SoC RTL simulation and a $2.03\times$ improvement over a state-of-the-art cross-layer RTL injection tool. ENFOR-SA code is publicly available at https://github.com/rafaabt/ENFOR-SA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00909v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Deep Learning for Medical Imaging: Bridging the Gap Between High-Performance AI and Clinical Deployment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00910</link><description>arXiv:2602.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, playing a vital role in modern clinical applications. However, the deployment of large-scale models in real-world clinical settings remains challenging due to high computational costs, latency constraints, and patient data privacy concerns associated with cloud-based processing. To address these bottlenecks, this review provides a comprehensive synthesis of efficient and lightweight deep learning architectures specifically tailored for the medical domain. We categorize the landscape of modern efficient models into three primary streams: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Lightweight Transformers, and emerging Linear Complexity Models. Furthermore, we examine key model compression strategies (including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and low-rank factorization) and evaluate their efficacy in maintaining diagnostic performance while reducing hardware requirements. By identifying current limitations and discussing the transition toward on-device intelligence, this review serves as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners aiming to bridge the gap between high-performance AI and resource-constrained clinical environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00910v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synapse Compendium Aware Federated Knowledge Exchange for Tool Routed LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00911</link><description>arXiv:2602.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative learning among LLM-based agents under federated learning faces challenges, including communication costs, heterogeneity in data, and tool-usage, limiting their effectiveness. We introduce Synapse, a framework that trains a shared global knowledge model of tool-usage behavior. Client agents with fixed LLMs learn tool-usage patterns locally, and transmit artifacts for federated aggregation through coordinators. A global tool compendium is updated and redistributed, enabling convergence toward stable tool selection. Synapse uses templated representations, embedding retrieval with LLM reranking, and adaptive masking to maintain utility while limiting information leakage. The framework supports heterogeneous data and quantifies performance improvements. Results show that Synapse improves tool-usage effectiveness and reduces communication overhead compared with weight or prompt-sharing approaches in multi-agent LLM systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing and Comparing the Coverage of Publications of Italian Universities in OpenCitations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00912</link><description>arXiv:2602.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent initiatives advocating responsible, transparent research assessment have intensified the call to use open research information rather than proprietary databases. This study evaluates the coverage and citation representation of publications recorded in the Current Research Information Systems (CRIS), all instances of the IRIS software platform, of six Italian universities within OpenCitations, a community-owned open infrastructure. Using persistent identifiers (DOIs, PMIDs, and ISBNs) specified in the IRIS installations involved, we matched the publications recorded in OpenCitations Meta and extracted the related citation links from the OpenCitations Index. Results show that OpenCitations covers, on average, over 40% of IRIS publications, which is quantitatively comparable to those reported by Scopus and Web of Science in another study. However, gaps persist, particularly for publication types prevalent in the Social Sciences and Humanities, such as monographs and critical editions. Overall, the findings demonstrate the growing maturity of OpenCitations and, more broadly, of Open Science infrastructures as viable alternatives as sources of research information, while highlighting areas where further metadata enrichment and interoperability efforts are needed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00912v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Schwartz Higher-Order Values Help Sentence-Level Human Value Detection? When Hard Gating Hurts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00913</link><description>arXiv:2602.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentence-level human value detection is typically framed as multi-label classification over Schwartz values, but it remains unclear whether Schwartz higher-order (HO) categories provide usable structure. We study this under a strict compute-frugal budget (single 8 GB GPU) on ValueEval'24 / ValuesML (74K English sentences). We compare (i) direct supervised transformers, (ii) HO$\rightarrow$values pipelines that enforce the hierarchy with hard masks, and (iii) Presence$\rightarrow$HO$\rightarrow$values cascades, alongside low-cost add-ons (lexica, short context, topics), label-wise threshold tuning, small instruction-tuned LLM baselines ($\le$10B), QLoRA, and simple ensembles. HO categories are learnable from single sentences (e.g., the easiest bipolar pair reaches Macro-$F_1\approx0.58$), but hard hierarchical gating is not a reliable win: it often reduces end-task Macro-$F_1$ via error compounding and recall suppression. In contrast, label-wise threshold tuning is a high-leverage knob (up to $+0.05$ Macro-$F_1$), and small transformer ensembles provide the most consistent additional gains (up to $+0.02$ Macro-$F_1$). Small LLMs lag behind supervised encoders as stand-alone systems, yet can contribute complementary errors in cross-family ensembles. Overall, HO structure is useful descriptively, but enforcing it with hard gates hurts sentence-level value detection; robust improvements come from calibration and lightweight ensembling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00913v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Baseline Multimodal Approach to Emotion Recognition in Conversations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00914</link><description>arXiv:2602.00914v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasping aims to generate stable and diverse grasps for robotic hands with heterogeneous kinematic structures. Existing methods are often tailored to specific hand designs and fail to generalize to unseen hand morphologies outside the training distribution. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{UniMorphGrasp}, a diffusion-based framework that incorporates hand morphological information into the grasp generation process for unified cross-embodiment grasp synthesis. The proposed approach maps grasps from diverse robotic hands into a unified human-like canonical hand pose representation, providing a common space for learning. Grasp generation is then conditioned on structured representations of hand kinematics, encoded as graphs derived from hand configurations, together with object geometry. In addition, a loss function is introduced that exploits the hierarchical organization of hand kinematics to guide joint-level supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMorphGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing dexterous grasp benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to previously unseen hand structures, enabling scalable and practical cross-embodiment grasp deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00915v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Green-VLA: Staged Vision-Language-Action Model for Generalist Robots</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00919</link><description>arXiv:2602.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Green-VLA, a staged Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework for real-world deployment on the Green humanoid robot while maintaining generalization across diverse embodiments. Green-VLA follows a five stage curriculum: (L0) foundational VLMs, (L1) multimodal grounding, (R0) multi-embodiment pretraining, (R1) embodiment-specific adaptation, and (R2) reinforcement-learning (RL) policy alignment. We couple a scalable data-processing pipeline (3,000 hours of demonstrations) with temporal alignment and quality filtering, and use a unified, embodiment-aware action interface enabling a single policy to control humanoids, mobile manipulators, and fixed-base arms. At inference, the VLA controller is enhanced with episode-progress prediction, out-of-distribution detection, and joint-prediction-based guidance to improve safety and precise target selection. Experiments on Simpler BRIDGE WidowX and CALVIN ABC-D, as well as real-robot evaluations, show strong generalization and performance gains from RL alignment in success rate, robustness, and long-horizon efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00919v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SanD-Planner: Sample-Efficient Diffusion Planner in B-Spline Space for Robust Local Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00923</link><description>arXiv:2602.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of generating reliable local plans has long hindered practical applications in highly cluttered and dynamic environments. Key fundamental bottlenecks include acquiring large-scale expert demonstrations across diverse scenes and improving learning efficiency with limited data. This paper proposes SanD-Planner, a sample-efficient diffusion-based local planner that conducts depth image-based imitation learning within the clamped B-spline space. By operating within this compact space, the proposed algorithm inherently yields smooth outputs with bounded prediction errors over local supports, naturally aligning with receding-horizon execution. Integration of an ESDF-based safety checker with explicit clearance and time-to-completion metrics further reduces the training burden associated with value-function learning for feasibility assessment. Experiments show that training with $500$ episodes (merely $0.25\%$ of the demonstration scale used by the baseline), SanD-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluated open benchmark, attaining success rates of $90.1\%$ in simulated cluttered environments and $72.0\%$ in indoor simulations. The performance is further proven by demonstrating zero-shot transferability to realistic experimentation in both 2D and 3D scenes. The dataset and pre-trained models will also be open-sourced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00923v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Supervised sparse auto-encoders as unconstrained feature models for semantic composition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00924</link><description>arXiv:2602.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) have re-emerged as a prominent method for mechanistic interpretability, yet they face two significant challenges: the non-smoothness of the $L_1$ penalty, which hinders reconstruction and scalability, and a lack of alignment between learned features and human semantics. In this paper, we address these limitations by adapting unconstrained feature models-a mathematical framework from neural collapse theory-and by supervising the task. We supervise (decoder-only) SAEs to reconstruct feature vectors by jointly learning sparse concept embeddings and decoder weights. Validated on Stable Diffusion 3.5, our approach demonstrates compositional generalization, successfully reconstructing images with concept combinations unseen during training, and enabling feature-level intervention for semantic image editing without prompt modification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00924v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond What Seems Necessary: Hidden Gains from Scaling Training-Time Reasoning Length under Outcome Supervision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00927</link><description>arXiv:2602.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training LLMs to think and reason for longer has become a key ingredient in building state-of-the-art models that can solve complex problems previously out of reach. Recent efforts pursue this in different ways, such as RL fine-tuning to elicit long CoT or scaling latent reasoning through architectural recurrence. This makes reasoning length an important scaling knob. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon (both theoretically and experimentally): under outcome-only supervision, out-of-distribution (OOD) performance can continue improving as training-time reasoning length (e.g., the token budget in RL, or the loop count in looped Transformers) increases, even after in-distribution (ID) performance has saturated. This suggests that robustness may require a larger budget than ID validation alone would indicate. We provide theoretical explanations via two mechanisms: (i) self-iteration can induce a stronger inductive bias in the hypothesis class, reshaping ID-optimal solutions in ways that improve OOD generalization; and (ii) when shortcut solutions that work for ID samples but not for OOD samples persist in the hypothesis class, regularization can reduce the learned solution's reliance on these shortcuts as the number of self-iterations increases. We complement the theory with empirical evidence from two realizations of scaling training-time reasoning length: increasing the number of loops in looped Transformers on a synthetic task, and increasing token budgets during RL fine-tuning of LLMs on mathematical reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00927v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Abstractions for Hierarchical Planning in Program-Synthesis Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00929</link><description>arXiv:2602.00929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans learn abstractions and use them to plan efficiently to quickly generalize across tasks -- an ability that remains challenging for state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) agents and deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems. Inspired by the cognitive science of how people form abstractions and intuitive theories of their world knowledge, Theory-Based RL (TBRL) systems, such as TheoryCoder, exhibit strong generalization through effective use of abstractions. However, they heavily rely on human-provided abstractions and sidestep the abstraction-learning problem. We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban. We find that TheoryCoder-2 is significantly more sample-efficient than baseline LLM agents augmented with classical planning domain construction, reasoning-based planning, and prior program-synthesis agents such as WorldCoder. TheoryCoder-2 is able to solve complex tasks that the baselines fail, while only requiring minimal human prompts, unlike prior TBRL systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00929v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Continuous-Utility Direct Preference Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00931</link><description>arXiv:2602.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model reasoning is often treated as a monolithic capability, relying on binary preference supervision that fails to capture partial progress or fine-grained reasoning quality. We introduce Continuous Utility Direct Preference Optimization (CU-DPO), a framework that aligns models to a portfolio of prompt-based cognitive strategies by replacing binary labels with continuous scores that capture fine-grained reasoning quality. We prove that learning with K strategies yields a Theta(K log K) improvement in sample complexity over binary preferences, and that DPO converges to the entropy-regularized utility-maximizing policy. To exploit this signal, we propose a two-stage training pipeline: (i) strategy selection, which optimizes the model to choose the best strategy for a given problem via best-vs-all comparisons, and (ii) execution refinement, which trains the model to correctly execute the selected strategy using margin-stratified pairs. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, CU-DPO improves strategy selection accuracy from 35-46 percent to 68-78 percent across seven base models, yielding consistent downstream reasoning gains of up to 6.6 points on in-distribution datasets with effective transfer to out-of-distribution tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00931v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MCP-Atlas: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Tool-Use Competency with Real MCP Servers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00933</link><description>arXiv:2602.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly becoming the standard interface for Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover and invoke external tools. However, existing evaluations often fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios, relying on restricted toolsets, simplistic workflows, or subjective LLM-as-a-judge metrics. We introduce MCP-Atlas, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating tool-use competency, comprising 36 real MCP servers and 220 tools. It includes 1,000 tasks designed to assess tool-use competency in realistic, multi-step workflows. Tasks use natural language prompts that avoid naming specific tools or servers, requiring agents to identify and orchestrate 3-6 tool calls across multiple servers. We score tasks using a claims-based rubric that awards partial credit based on the factual claims satisfied in the model's final answer, complemented by internal diagnostics on tool discovery, parameterization, syntax, error recovery, and efficiency. Evaluation results on frontier models reveal that top models achieve pass rates exceeding 50%, with primary failures arising from inadequate tool usage and task understanding. We release the task schema, containerized harness, and a 500-task public subset of the benchmark dataset to facilitate reproducible comparisons and advance the development of robust, tool-augmented agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CLAMP: Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00937</link><description>arXiv:2602.00937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained 2D image representations in behavior cloning policies has achieved great success and has become a standard approach for robotic manipulation. However, such representations fail to capture the 3D spatial information about objects and scenes that is essential for precise manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining (CLAMP), a novel 3D pre-training framework that utilizes point clouds and robot actions. From the merged point cloud computed from RGB-D images and camera extrinsics, we re-render multi-view four-channel image observations with depth and 3D coordinates, including dynamic wrist views, to provide clearer views of target objects for high-precision manipulation tasks. The pre-trained encoders learn to associate the 3D geometric and positional information of objects with robot action patterns via contrastive learning on large-scale simulated robot trajectories. During encoder pre-training, we pre-train a Diffusion Policy to initialize the policy weights for fine-tuning, which is essential for improving fine-tuning sample efficiency and performance. After pre-training, we fine-tune the policy on a limited amount of task demonstrations using the learned image and action representations. We demonstrate that this pre-training and fine-tuning design substantially improves learning efficiency and policy performance on unseen tasks. Furthermore, we show that CLAMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across six simulated tasks and five real-world tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00937v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LMTE: Putting the "Reasoning" into WAN Traffic Engineering with Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00941</link><description>arXiv:2602.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of modern wide-area networks (WANs) has made traffic engineering (TE) increasingly challenging, as traditional solvers struggle to keep pace. Although existing offline ML-driven approaches accelerate TE optimization with deep neural networks (DNNs), they often lack sufficient expressiveness and generalization on unseen traffic patterns or topologies, limiting their practicality. Inspired by the success of large language models (LMs), for the first time, this paper investigates their potential as general-purpose traffic planners. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) Theoretically, we show that pre-trained LMs can simulate the sequential decision processes underlying TE and, crucially, exhibit parallel reasoning capabilities, making them well-suited for the task; (ii) Practically, we present LMTE, a novel LM-driven TE framework that embraces these insights through efficient multimodal alignment and lightweight configuration generation, all while preserving the model's original abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fold matches top-tier performance on five datasets, achieving up to 15\% better maximum link utilization (MLU) and consistently lower performance degradation across diverse scenarios, e.g., less than 5\% with high traffic dynamics and link failures. Moreover, it achieves 10 to 100 times speedups over traditional TE solvers.

Abstract: Modern large language models are increasingly deployed under compute and memory constraints, making flexible control of model capacity a central challenge. While sparse and low-rank structures naturally trade off capacity and performance, existing approaches often rely on heuristic designs that ignore layer and matrix heterogeneity or require model-specific architectural modifications. We propose SALAAD, a plug-and-play framework applicable to different model architectures that induces sparse and low-rank structures during training. By formulating structured weight learning under an augmented Lagrangian framework and introducing an adaptive controller that dynamically balances the training loss and structural constraints, SALAAD preserves the stability of standard training dynamics while enabling explicit control over the evolution of effective model capacity during training. Experiments across model scales show that SALAAD substantially reduces memory consumption during deployment while achieving performance comparable to ad-hoc methods. Moreover, a single training run yields a continuous spectrum of model capacities, enabling smooth and elastic deployment across diverse memory budgets without the need for retraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Prior Thompson Sampling for Cold-Start Exploration in Recommender Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00943</link><description>arXiv:2602.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold-start exploration is a core challenge in large-scale recommender systems: new or data-sparse items must receive traffic to estimate value, but over-exploration harms users and wastes impressions. In practice, Thompson Sampling (TS) is often initialized with a uniform Beta(1,1) prior, implicitly assuming a 50% success rate for unseen items. When true base rates are far lower, this optimistic prior systematically over-allocates to weak items. The impact is amplified by batched policy updates and pipeline latency: for hours, newly launched items can remain effectively "no data," so the prior dominates allocation before feedback is incorporated. We propose Dynamic Prior Thompson Sampling, a prior design that directly controls the probability that a new arm outcompetes the incumbent winner. Our key contribution is a closed-form quadratic solution for the prior mean that enforces P(X_j &gt; Y_k) = epsilon at introduction time, making exploration intensity predictable and tunable while preserving TS Bayesian updates. Across Monte Carlo validation, offline batched simulations, and a large-scale online experiment on a thumbnail personalization system serving millions of users, dynamic priors deliver precise exploration control and improved efficiency versus a uniform-prior baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural FOXP2 -- Language Specific Neuron Steering for Targeted Language Improvement in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00945</link><description>arXiv:2602.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract:  LLMs are multilingual by training, yet their lingua franca is often English, reflecting English language dominance in pretraining. Other languages remain in parametric memory but are systematically suppressed. We argue that language defaultness is governed by a sparse, low-rank control circuit, language neurons, that can be mechanistically isolated and safely steered.
  We introduce Neural FOXP2, that makes a chosen language (Hindi or Spanish) primary in a model by steering language-specific neurons. Neural FOXP2 proceeds in three stages: (i) Localize: We train per-layer SAEs so each activation decomposes into a small set of active feature components. For every feature, we quantify English vs. Hindi/Spanish selectivity overall logit-mass lift toward the target-language token set. Tracing the top-ranked features back to their strongest contributing units yields a compact language-neuron set. (ii) Steering directions: We localize controllable language-shift geometry via a spectral low-rank analysis. For each layer, we build English to target activation-difference matrices and perform layerwise SVD to extract the dominant singular directions governing language change. The eigengap and effective-rank spectra identify a compact steering subspace and an empirically chosen intervention window (where these directions are strongest and most stable). (iii) Steer: We apply a signed, sparse activation shift targeted to the language neurons. Concretely, within low to mid layers we add a positive steering along the target-language dominant directions and a compensating negative shift toward the null space for the English neurons, yielding controllable target-language defaultness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00945v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ConsensusDrop: Fusing Visual and Cross-Modal Saliency for Efficient Vision Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00946</link><description>arXiv:2602.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are expensive because the LLM processes hundreds of largely redundant visual tokens. Existing token reduction methods typically exploit \textit{either} vision-encoder saliency (broad but query-agnostic) \textit{or} LLM cross-attention (query-aware but sparse and costly). We show that neither signal alone is sufficient: fusing them consistently improves performance compared to unimodal visual token selection (ranking). However, making such fusion practical is non-trivial: cross-modal saliency is usually only available \emph{inside} the LLM (too late for efficient pre-LLM pruning), and the two signals are inherently asymmetric, so naive fusion underutilizes their complementary strengths. We propose \textbf{ConsensusDrop}, a training-free framework that derives a \emph{consensus} ranking by reconciling vision encoder saliency with query-aware cross-attention, retaining the most informative tokens while compressing the remainder via encoder-guided token merging. Across LLaVA-1.5/NeXT, Video-LLaVA, and other open-source VLMs, ConsensusDrop consistently outperforms prior pruning methods under identical token budgets and delivers a stronger accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier -- preserving near-baseline accuracy even at aggressive token reductions while reducing TTFT and KV cache footprint. Our code will be open-sourced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00946v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Keyhole Effect: Why Chat Interfaces Fail at Data Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00947</link><description>arXiv:2602.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chat has become the default interface for AI-assisted data analysis. For multi-step, state-dependent analytical tasks, this is a mistake. Building on Woods (1984) Keyhole Effect, the cognitive cost of viewing large information spaces through narrow viewports, I show that chat interfaces systematically degrade analytical performance through five mechanisms: (1) constant content displacement defeats hippocampal spatial memory systems; (2) hidden state variables exceed working memory capacity (approximately 4 chunks under load); (3) forced verbalization triggers verbal overshadowing, degrading visual pattern recognition; (4) linear text streams block epistemic action and cognitive offloading; (5) serialization penalties scale with data dimensionality. I formalize cognitive overload as O = max(0, m - v - W) where m is task-relevant items, v is visible items, and W is working memory capacity. When O &gt; 0, error probability increases and analytical biases (anchoring, confirmation, change blindness) amplify. Eight hybrid design patterns address these failures: Generative UI, Infinite Canvas, Deictic Interaction, State Rail, Ghost Layers, Mise en Place, Semantic Zoom, and Probabilistic UI. Each pattern targets specific cognitive bottlenecks while preserving natural language for intent specification and synthesis. Well-scaffolded conversational systems that encode expert priors may reduce load for guided tasks; the framework applies most strongly to open-ended exploration. The paper concludes with falsifiable hypotheses and experimental paradigms for empirical validation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00947v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data Augmentation for High-Fidelity Generation of CAR-T/NK Immunological Synapse Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00949</link><description>arXiv:2602.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T and NK cell immunotherapies have transformed cancer treatment, and recent studies suggest that the quality of the CAR-T/NK cell immunological synapse (IS) may serve as a functional biomarker for predicting therapeutic efficacy. Accurate detection and segmentation of CAR-T/NK IS structures using artificial neural networks (ANNs) can greatly increase the speed and reliability of IS quantification. However, a persistent challenge is the limited size of annotated microscopy datasets, which restricts the ability of ANNs to generalize. To address this challenge, we integrate two complementary data-augmentation frameworks. First, we employ Instance Aware Automatic Augmentation (IAAA), an automated, instance-preserving augmentation method that generates synthetic CAR-T/NK IS images and corresponding segmentation masks by applying optimized augmentation policies to original IS data. IAAA supports multiple imaging modalities (e.g., fluorescence and brightfield) and can be applied directly to CAR-T/NK IS images derived from patient samples. In parallel, we introduce a Semantic-Aware AI Augmentation (SAAA) pipeline that combines a diffusion-based mask generator with a Pix2Pix conditional image synthesizer. This second method enables the creation of diverse, anatomically realistic segmentation masks and produces high-fidelity CAR-T/NK IS images aligned with those masks, further expanding the training corpus beyond what IAAA alone can provide. Together, these augmentation strategies generate synthetic images whose visual and structural properties closely match real IS data, significantly improving CAR-T/NK IS detection and segmentation performance. By enhancing the robustness and accuracy of IS quantification, this work supports the development of more reliable imaging-based biomarkers for predicting patient response to CAR-T/NK immunotherapy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00949v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MindGuard: Guardrail Classifiers for Multi-Turn Mental Health Support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00950</link><description>arXiv:2602.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for mental health support, yet their conversational coherence alone does not ensure clinical appropriateness. Existing general-purpose safeguards often fail to distinguish between therapeutic disclosures and genuine clinical crises, leading to safety failures. To address this gap, we introduce a clinically grounded risk taxonomy, developed in collaboration with PhD-level psychologists, that identifies actionable harm (e.g., self-harm and harm to others) while preserving space for safe, non-crisis therapeutic content. We release MindGuard-testset, a dataset of real-world multi-turn conversations annotated at the turn level by clinical experts. Using synthetic dialogues generated via a controlled two-agent setup, we train MindGuard, a family of lightweight safety classifiers (with 4B and 8B parameters). Our classifiers reduce false positives at high-recall operating points and, when paired with clinician language models, help achieve lower attack success and harmful engagement rates in adversarial multi-turn interactions compared to general-purpose safeguards. We release all models and human evaluation data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00950v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] R-HTN: Rebellious Online HTN Planning for Safety and Game AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00951</link><description>arXiv:2602.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce online Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) agents whose behaviors are governed by a set of built-in directives \D. Like other agents that are capable of rebellion (i.e., {\it intelligent disobedience}), our agents will, under some conditions, not perform a user-assigned task and instead act in ways that do not meet a user's expectations. Our work combines three concepts: HTN planning, online planning, and the directives \D, which must be considered when performing user-assigned tasks. We investigate two agent variants: (1) a Nonadaptive agent that stops execution if it finds itself in violation of \D~ and (2) an Adaptive agent that, in the same situation, instead modifies its HTN plan to search for alternative ways to achieve its given task. We present R-HTN (for: Rebellious-HTN), a general algorithm for online HTN planning under directives \D. We evaluate R-HTN in two task domains where the agent must not violate some directives for safety reasons or as dictated by their personality traits. We found that R-HTN agents never violate directives, and aim to achieve the user-given goals if feasible though not necessarily as the user expected.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00951v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal Budgeted Adaptation of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00952</link><description>arXiv:2602.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trade-off between labeled data availability and downstream accuracy remains a central challenge in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). We propose a principled framework for \emph{budget-aware supervised fine-tuning} by casting LLM adaptation as a contextual Stackelberg game. In our formulation, the learner (leader) commits to a scoring policy and a label-querying strategy, while an adaptive environment (follower) selects challenging supervised alternatives in response. To explicitly address label efficiency, we incorporate a finite supervision budget directly into the learning objective. Our algorithm operates in the full-feedback regime and achieves $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret under standard linear contextual assumptions. We extend the framework with a Largest-Latency-First (LLF) confidence gate that selectively queries labels, achieving a budget-aware regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dB} + c\sqrt{B})$ with $B=\beta T$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00952v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAGE: Agentic Framework for Interpretable and Clinically Translatable Computational Pathology Biomarker Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00953</link><description>arXiv:2602.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in computational pathology, many AI models remain black-box and difficult to interpret, posing a major barrier to clinical adoption due to limited transparency and explainability. This has motivated continued interest in engineered image-based biomarkers, which offer greater interpretability but are often proposed based on anecdotal evidence or fragmented prior literature rather than systematic biological validation. We introduce SAGE (Structured Agentic system for hypothesis Generation and Evaluation), an agentic AI system designed to identify interpretable, engineered pathology biomarkers by grounding them in biological evidence. SAGE integrates literature-anchored reasoning with multimodal data analysis to correlate image-derived features with molecular biomarkers, such as gene expression, and clinically relevant outcomes. By coordinating specialized agents for biological contextualization and empirical hypothesis validation, SAGE prioritizes transparent, biologically supported biomarkers and advances the clinical translation of computational pathology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00953v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Small-Margin Preferences Still Matter-If You Train Them Right</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00954</link><description>arXiv:2602.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference optimization methods such as DPO align large language models (LLMs) using paired comparisons, but their effectiveness can be highly sensitive to the quality and difficulty of preference pairs. A common heuristic treats small-margin (ambiguous) pairs as noisy and filters them out. In this paper, we revisit this assumption and show that pair difficulty interacts strongly with the optimization objective: when trained with preference-based losses, difficult pairs can destabilize training and harm alignment, yet these same pairs still contain useful supervision signals when optimized with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose MixDPO, a simple yet effective difficulty-aware training strategy that (i) orders preference data from easy to hard (a curriculum over margin-defined difficulty), and (ii) routes difficult pairs to an SFT objective while applying a preference loss to easy pairs. This hybrid design provides a practical mechanism to leverage ambiguous pairs without incurring the optimization failures often associated with preference losses on low-margin data. Across three LLM-judge benchmarks, MixDPO consistently improves alignment over DPO and a range of widely-used variants, with particularly strong gains on AlpacaEval~2 length-controlled (LC) win rate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00954v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Topological and Deep Feature Fusion for Accurate MRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Severity Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00956</link><description>arXiv:2602.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical challenge in neuroimaging-based clinical decision support systems. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with a DenseNet121 backbone for four-class Alzheimer's disease classification using structural MRI data from the OASIS dataset. TDA is employed to capture complementary topological characteristics of brain structures that are often overlooked by conventional neural networks, while DenseNet121 efficiently learns hierarchical spatial features from MRI slices. The extracted deep and topological features are fused to enhance class separability across the four AD stages.
  Extensive experiments conducted on the OASIS-1 Kaggle MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed TDA+DenseNet121 model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. The model achieves an accuracy of 99.93% and an AUC of 100%, surpassing recently published CNN-based, transfer learning, ensemble, and multi-scale architectures. These results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating topological insights into deep learning pipelines and highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a robust and highly accurate tool for automated Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00956v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From drift to adaptation to the failed ml model: Transfer Learning in Industrial MLOps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00957</link><description>arXiv:2602.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model adaptation to production environment is critical for reliable Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), less attention is paid to developing systematic framework for updating the ML models when they fail under data drift. This paper compares the transfer learning enabled model update strategies including ensemble transfer learning (ETL), all-layers transfer learning (ALTL), and last-layer transfer learning (LLTL) for updating the failed feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) model. The flue gas differential pressure across the air preheater unit installed in a 660 MW thermal power plant is analyzed as a case study since it mimics the batch processes due to load cycling in the power plant. Updating the failed ANN model by three transfer learning techniques reveals that ETL provides relatively higher predictive accuracy for the batch size of 5 days than those of LLTL and ALTL. However, ALTL is found to be suitable for effective update of the model trained on large batch size (8 days). A mixed trend is observed for computational requirement (hyperparameter tuning and model training) of model update techniques for different batch sizes. These fundamental and empiric insights obtained from the batch process-based industrial case study can assist the MLOps practitioners in adapting the failed models to data drifts for the accurate monitoring of industrial processes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00957v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probing the Knowledge Boundary: An Interactive Agentic Framework for Deep Knowledge Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00959</link><description>arXiv:2602.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be seen as compressed knowledge bases, but it remains unclear what knowledge they truly contain and how far their knowledge boundaries extend. Existing benchmarks are mostly static and provide limited support for systematic knowledge probing. In this paper, we propose an interactive agentic framework to systematically extract and quantify the knowledge of LLMs. Our method includes four adaptive exploration policies to probe knowledge at different granularities. To ensure the quality of extracted knowledge, we introduce a three-stage knowledge processing pipeline that combines vector-based filtering to remove exact duplicates, LLM-based adjudication to resolve ambiguous semantic overlaps, and domain-relevance auditing to retain valid knowledge units. Through extensive experiments, we find that recursive taxonomy is the most effective exploration strategy. We also observe a clear knowledge scaling law, where larger models consistently extract more knowledge. In addition, we identify a Pass@1-versus-Pass@k trade-off: domain-specialized models achieve higher initial accuracy but degrade rapidly, while general-purpose models maintain stable performance during extended extraction. Finally, our results show that differences in training data composition lead to distinct and measurable knowledge profiles across model families.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Scientific Learning Beyond Diffusions and Flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00960</link><description>arXiv:2602.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) increasingly requires models that capture multimodal conditional uncertainty arising from ill-posed inverse problems, multistability, and chaotic dynamics. While recent work has favored highly expressive implicit generative models such as diffusion and flow-based methods, these approaches are often data-hungry, computationally costly, and misaligned with the structured solution spaces frequently found in scientific problems. We demonstrate that Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) provide a principled yet largely overlooked alternative for multimodal uncertainty quantification in SciML. As explicit parametric density estimators, MDNs impose an inductive bias tailored to low-dimensional, multimodal physics, enabling direct global allocation of probability mass across distinct solution branches. This structure delivers strong data efficiency, allowing reliable recovery of separated modes in regimes where scientific data is scarce. We formalize these insights through a unified probabilistic framework contrasting explicit and implicit distribution networks, and demonstrate empirically that MDNs achieve superior generalization, interpretability, and sample efficiency across a range of inverse, multistable, and chaotic scientific regression tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00960v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Symphony-Coord: Emergent Coordination in Decentralized Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00966</link><description>arXiv:2602.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model systems can tackle complex multi-step tasks by decomposing work and coordinating specialized behaviors. However, current coordination mechanisms typically rely on statically assigned roles and centralized controllers. As agent pools and task distributions evolve, these design choices lead to inefficient routing, poor adaptability, and fragile fault recovery capabilities. We introduce Symphony-Coord, a decentralized multi-agent framework that transforms agent selection into an online multi-armed bandit problem, enabling roles to emerge organically through interaction. The framework employs a two-stage dynamic beacon protocol: (i) a lightweight candidate screening mechanism to limit communication and computational overhead; (ii) an adaptive LinUCB selector that routes subtasks based on context features derived from task requirements and agent states, continuously optimized through delayed end-to-end feedback. Under standard linear realizability assumptions, we provide sublinear regret bounds, indicating the system converges toward near-optimal allocation schemes.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) at ultra-low precision is critically impeded by instability rooted in the conflict between discrete quantization constraints and the intrinsic heavy-tailed spectral nature of linguistic data. By formalizing the connection between Zipfian statistics and random matrix theory, we prove that the power-law decay in the singular value spectra of embeddings is a fundamental requisite for semantic encoding. We derive theoretical bounds showing that uniform quantization introduces a noise floor that disproportionately truncates this spectral tail, which induces spectral flattening and a strictly provable increase in the stable rank of representations. Empirical validation across diverse architectures including GPT-2 and TinyLlama corroborates that this geometric degradation precipitates representational collapse. This work not only quantifies the spectral sensitivity of LLMs but also establishes spectral fidelity as a necessary condition for stable low-bit optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Verification Required: The Impact of Information Credibility on AI Persuasion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00970</link><description>arXiv:2602.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where communication shapes high-stakes decisions, making a principled understanding of strategic communication essential. Prior work largely studies either unverifiable cheap-talk or fully verifiable disclosure, failing to capture realistic domains in which information has probabilistic credibility. We introduce MixTalk, a strategic communication game for LLM-to-LLM interaction that models information credibility. In MixTalk, a sender agent strategically combines verifiable and unverifiable claims to communicate private information, while a receiver agent allocates a limited budget to costly verification and infers the underlying state from prior beliefs, claims, and verification outcomes. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM agents in large-scale tournaments across three realistic deployment settings, revealing their strengths and limitations in reasoning about information credibility and the explicit behavior that shapes these interactions. Finally, we propose Tournament Oracle Policy Distillation (TOPD), an offline method that distills tournament oracle policy from interaction logs and deploys it in-context at inference time. Our results show that TOPD significantly improves receiver robustness to persuasion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling the Cognitive Compass: Theory-of-Mind-Guided Multimodal Emotion Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00971</link><description>arXiv:2602.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their capability for deep emotional understanding remains limited. We argue that genuine affective intelligence requires explicit modeling of Theory of Mind (ToM), the cognitive substrate from which emotions arise. To this end, we introduce HitEmotion, a ToM-grounded hierarchical benchmark that diagnoses capability breakpoints across increasing levels of cognitive depth. Second, we propose a ToM-guided reasoning chain that tracks mental states and calibrates cross-modal evidence to achieve faithful emotional reasoning. We further introduce TMPO, a reinforcement learning method that uses intermediate mental states as process-level supervision to guide and strengthen model reasoning. Extensive experiments show that HitEmotion exposes deep emotional reasoning deficits in state-of-the-art models, especially on cognitively demanding tasks. In evaluation, the ToM-guided reasoning chain and TMPO improve end-task accuracy and yield more faithful, more coherent rationales. In conclusion, our work provides the research community with a practical toolkit for evaluating and enhancing the cognition-based emotional understanding capabilities of MLLMs. Our dataset and code are available at: https://HitEmotion.github.io/.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00971v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cast: Automated Resilience Testing for Production Cloud Service Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00972</link><description>arXiv:2602.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distributed nature of microservice architecture introduces significant resilience challenges. Traditional testing methods, limited by extensive manual effort and oversimplified test environments, fail to capture production system complexity. To address these limitations, we present Cast, an automated, end-to-end framework for microservice resilience testing in production. It achieves high test fidelity by replaying production traffic against a comprehensive library of application-level faults to exercise internal error-handling logic. To manage the combinatorial test space, Cast employs a complexity-driven strategy to systematically prune redundant tests and prioritize high-value tests targeting the most critical service execution paths. Cast automates the testing lifecycle through a three-phase pipeline (i.e., startup, fault injection, and recovery) and uses a multi-faceted oracle to automatically verify system resilience against nuanced criteria. Deployed in Huawei Cloud for over eight months, Cast has been adopted by many service teams to proactively address resilience vulnerabilities. Our analysis on four large-scale applications with millions of traces reveals 137 potential vulnerabilities, with 89 confirmed by developers. To further quantify its performance, Cast is evaluated on a benchmark set of 48 reproduced bugs, achieving a high coverage of 90%. The results show that Cast is a practical and effective solution for systematically improving the reliability of industrial microservice systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00972v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploration of Radar-based Obstacle Visualizations to Support Safety and Presence in Camera-Free Outdoor VR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00973</link><description>arXiv:2602.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outdoor virtual reality (VR) places users in dynamic physical environments where they must remain aware of real-world obstacles, including static structures and moving bystanders, while immersed in a virtual scene. This dual demand introduces challenges for both user safety and presence. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar offers a privacy-preserving alternative to camera-based sensing by detecting obstacles without capturing identifiable visual imagery, yet effective methods for communicating its sparse spatial information to users remain underexplored. In this work, we developed and validated WaveWalkerClone, a reproduction of the WaveWalker system, to establish reliable radar- and GPS-IMU-based sensing under varied outdoor lighting conditions. Building on this feasibility validation, we conducted a user study (n=18) comparing three visualization techniques for radar-detected obstacles : (1) diegetic alien avatars that visually embed obstacles within the virtual narrative, (2) non-diegetic human avatars represented obstacles as humans inconsistent with the virtual narrative, and (3) abstract point clouds centered around the obstacles conveying spatial data without anthropomorphic or narrative associations. Our results show that all three approaches supported user safety and situational awareness, but yielded distinct trade-offs in perceived effort, frustration, and user preference. Qualitative feedback further revealed divergent user responses across conditions, highlighting the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach. We conclude with design considerations for obstacle visualization in outdoor VR systems that seek to balance immersion, safety, and bystander privacy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00973v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Forest-Guided Semantic Transport for Label-Supervised Manifold Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00974</link><description>arXiv:2602.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label-supervised manifold alignment bridges the gap between unsupervised and correspondence-based paradigms by leveraging shared label information to align multimodal datasets. Still, most existing methods rely on Euclidean geometry to model intra-domain relationships. This approach can fail when features are only weakly related to the task of interest, leading to noisy, semantically misleading structure and degraded alignment quality. To address this limitation, we introduce FoSTA (Forest-guided Semantic Transport Alignment), a scalable alignment framework that leverages forest-induced geometry to denoise intra-domain structure and recover task-relevant manifolds prior to alignment. FoSTA builds semantic representations directly from label-informed forest affinities and aligns them via fast, hierarchical semantic transport, capturing meaningful cross-domain relationships. Extensive comparisons with established baselines demonstrate that FoSTA improves correspondence recovery and label transfer on synthetic benchmarks and delivers strong performance in practical single-cell applications, including batch correction and biological conservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00974v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trust in One Round: Confidence Estimation for Large Language Models via Structural Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00977</link><description>arXiv:2602.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains where errors carry high social, scientific, or safety costs. Yet standard confidence estimators, such as token likelihood, semantic similarity and multi-sample consistency, remain brittle under distribution shift, domain-specialised text, and compute limits. In this work, we present Structural Confidence, a single-pass, model-agnostic framework that enhances output correctness prediction based on multi-scale structural signals derived from a model's final-layer hidden-state trajectory. By combining spectral, local-variation, and global shape descriptors, our method captures internal stability patterns that are missed by probabilities and sentence embeddings. We conduct extensive, cross-domain evaluation across four heterogeneous benchmarks-FEVER (fact verification), SciFact (scientific claims), WikiBio-hallucination (biographical consistency), and TruthfulQA (truthfulness-oriented QA). Our Structural Confidence framework demonstrates strong performance compared with established baselines in terms of AUROC and AUPR. More importantly, unlike sampling-based consistency methods which require multiple stochastic generations and an auxiliary model, our approach uses a single deterministic forward pass, offering a practical basis for efficient, robust post-hoc confidence estimation in socially impactful, resource-constrained LLM applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00977v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Organismal Agency and Rapid Adaptation: The Phenopoiesis Algorithm for Phenotype-First Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00978</link><description>arXiv:2602.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary success depends on the capacity to adapt: organisms must respond to environmental challenges through both genetic innovation and lifetime learning. The gene-centric paradigm attributes evolutionary causality exclusively to genes, while Denis Noble's phenotype-first framework argues that organisms are active agents capable of interpreting genetic resources, learning from experience, and shaping their own development. However, this framework has remained philosophically intuitive but algorithmically opaque.
  We show for the first time that organismal agency can be implemented as a concrete computational process through heritable phenotypic patterns. We introduce the Phenopoiesis Algorithm, where organisms inherit not just genes but also successful phenotypic patterns discovered during lifetime learning. Through experiments in changing environments, these pattern-inheriting organisms achieve 3.4 times faster adaptation compared to gene-centric models. Critically, these gains require cross-generational inheritance of learned patterns rather than within-lifetime learning alone.
  We conclude that organismal agency is not a philosophical abstraction but an algorithmic mechanism with measurable adaptive value. The mechanism works through compositional reuse: organisms discover how to compose primitive elements into solutions, encode those compositional recipes, and transmit them to offspring. Evolution operates across multiple timescales -- fast, reversible phenotypic inheritance and slow, permanent genetic inheritance -- providing adaptive flexibility that single-channel mechanisms cannot achieve.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00978v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GradingAttack: Attacking Large Language Models Towards Short Answer Grading Ability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00979</link><description>arXiv:2602.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for automatic short answer grading (ASAG), significantly boosting student assessment efficiency and scalability in educational scenarios. However, their vulnerability to adversarial manipulation raises critical concerns about automatic grading fairness and reliability. In this paper, we introduce GradingAttack, a fine-grained adversarial attack framework that systematically evaluates the vulnerability of LLM based ASAG models. Specifically, we align general-purpose attack methods with the specific objectives of ASAG by designing token-level and prompt-level strategies that manipulate grading outcomes while maintaining high camouflage. Furthermore, to quantify attack camouflage, we propose a novel evaluation metric that balances attack success and camouflage. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that both attack strategies effectively mislead grading models, with prompt-level attacks achieving higher success rates and token-level attacks exhibiting superior camouflage capability. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses to ensure fairness and reliability in ASAG.

Abstract: The density-distribution method has recently become a promising paradigm owing to its adaptability to variations in swarm size. However, existing studies face practical challenges in achieving complex shape representation and decentralized implementation. This motivates us to develop a fully decentralized, distribution-based control strategy with the dual capability of forming complex shapes and adapting to swarm-size variations. Specifically, we first propose a discrete mass-distribution function defined over a set of sample points to model swarm formation. In contrast to the continuous density-distribution method, our model eliminates the requirement for defining continuous density functions-a task that is difficult for complex shapes. Second, we design a decentralized meanshift control law to coordinate the swarm's global distribution to fit the sample-point distribution by feeding back mass estimates. The mass estimates for all sample points are achieved by the robots in a decentralized manner via the designed mass estimator. It is shown that the mass estimates of the sample points can asymptotically converge to the true global values. To validate the proposed strategy, we conduct comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate the efficiency of complex shape formation and adaptability to swarm-size variations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00980v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedSpeak: A Knowledge Graph-Aided ASR Error Correction Framework for Spoken Medical QA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00981</link><description>arXiv:2602.00981v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Visual robustness and neural alignment remain critical challenges in developing artificial agents that can match biological vision systems. We present the winning approaches from Team HCMUS_TheFangs for both tracks of the NeurIPS 2025 Mouse vs. AI: Robust Visual Foraging Competition. For Track 1 (Visual Robustness), we demonstrate that architectural simplicity combined with targeted components yields superior generalization, achieving 95.4% final score with a lightweight two-layer CNN enhanced by Gated Linear Units and observation normalization. For Track 2 (Neural Alignment), we develop a deep ResNet-like architecture with 16 convolutional layers and GLU-based gating that achieves top-1 neural prediction performance with 17.8 million parameters. Our systematic analysis of ten model checkpoints trained between 60K to 1.14M steps reveals that training duration exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with performance, with optimal results achieved around 200K steps. Through comprehensive ablation studies and failure case analysis, we provide insights into why simpler architectures excel at visual robustness while deeper models with increased capacity achieve better neural alignment. Our results challenge conventional assumptions about model complexity in visuomotor learning and offer practical guidance for developing robust, biologically-inspired visual agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00982v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DISPO: Enhancing Training Efficiency and Stability in Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Mathematical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00983</link><description>arXiv:2602.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models particularly in mathematics. Current approaches in this domain present a clear trade-off: PPO-style methods (e.g., GRPO/DAPO) offer training stability but exhibit slow learning trajectories due to their trust-region constraints on policy updates, while REINFORCE-style approaches (e.g., CISPO) demonstrate improved learning efficiency but suffer from performance instability as they clip importance sampling weights while still permitting non-zero gradients outside the trust-region. To address these limitations, we introduce DISPO, a simple yet effective REINFORCE-style algorithm that decouples the up-clipping and down-clipping of importance sampling weights for correct and incorrect responses, yielding four controllable policy update regimes. Through targeted ablations, we uncover how each regime impacts training: for correct responses, weights &gt;1 increase the average token entropy (i.e., exploration) while weights &lt;1 decrease it (i.e., distillation) -- both beneficial but causing gradual performance degradation when excessive. For incorrect responses, overly restrictive clipping triggers sudden performance collapse through repetitive outputs (when weights &gt;1) or vanishing response lengths (when weights &lt;1). By separately tuning these four clipping parameters, DISPO maintains the exploration-distillation balance while preventing catastrophic failures, achieving 61.04% on AIME'24 (vs. 55.42% CISPO and 50.21% DAPO) with similar gains across various benchmarks and models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00983v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse Reward Subsystem in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00986</link><description>arXiv:2602.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify a sparse reward subsystem within the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing an analogy to the biological reward subsystem in the human brain. We demonstrate that this subsystem contains value neurons that represent the model's internal expectation of state value, and through intervention experiments, we establish the importance of these neurons for reasoning. Our experiments reveal that these value neurons are robust across diverse datasets, model scales, and architectures; furthermore, they exhibit significant transferability across different datasets and models fine-tuned from the same base model. By examining cases where value predictions and actual rewards diverge, we identify dopamine neurons within the reward subsystem which encode reward prediction errors (RPE). These neurons exhibit high activation when the reward is higher than expected and low activation when the reward is lower than expected.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Random Wavelet Features: Efficient Non-Stationary Kernel Approximation with Convergence Guarantees</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00987</link><description>arXiv:2602.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling non-stationary processes, where statistical properties vary across the input domain, is a critical challenge in machine learning; yet most scalable methods rely on a simplifying assumption of stationarity. This forces a difficult trade-off: use expressive but computationally demanding models like Deep Gaussian Processes, or scalable but limited methods like Random Fourier Features (RFF). We close this gap by introducing Random Wavelet Features (RWF), a framework that constructs scalable, non-stationary kernel approximations by sampling from wavelet families. By harnessing the inherent localization and multi-resolution structure of wavelets, RWF generates an explicit feature map that captures complex, input-dependent patterns. Our framework provides a principled way to generalize RFF to the non-stationary setting and comes with a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including positive definiteness, unbiasedness, and uniform convergence guarantees. We demonstrate empirically on a range of challenging synthetic and real-world datasets that RWF outperforms stationary random features and offers a compelling accuracy-efficiency trade-off against more complex models, unlocking scalable and expressive kernel methods for a broad class of real-world non-stationary problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00987v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geometry-Aware Sampling-Based Motion Planning on Riemannian Manifolds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00992</link><description>arXiv:2602.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many robot motion planning problems, task objectives and physical constraints induce non-Euclidean geometry on the configuration space, yet many planners operate using Euclidean distances that ignore this structure. We address the problem of planning collision-free motions that minimize length under configuration-dependent Riemannian metrics, corresponding to geodesics on the configuration manifold. Conventional numerical methods for computing such paths do not scale well to high-dimensional systems, while sampling-based planners trade scalability for geometric fidelity. To bridge this gap, we propose a sampling-based motion planning framework that operates directly on Riemannian manifolds. We introduce a computationally efficient midpoint-based approximation of the Riemannian geodesic distance and prove that it matches the true Riemannian distance with third-order accuracy. Building on this approximation, we design a local planner that traces the manifold using first-order retractions guided by Riemannian natural gradients. Experiments on a two-link planar arm and a 7-DoF Franka manipulator under a kinetic-energy metric, as well as on rigid-body planning in $\mathrm{SE}(2)$ with non-holonomic motion constraints, demonstrate that our approach consistently produces lower-cost trajectories than Euclidean-based planners and classical numerical geodesic-solver baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00992v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HERMES: A Holistic End-to-End Risk-Aware Multimodal Embodied System with Vision-Language Models for Long-Tail Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00993</link><description>arXiv:2602.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models increasingly benefit from large vision--language models for semantic understanding, yet ensuring safe and accurate operation under long-tail conditions remains challenging. These challenges are particularly prominent in long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios, where autonomous vehicles must interact with heterogeneous road users, including human-driven vehicles and vulnerable road users, under complex and uncertain conditions. This paper proposes HERMES, a holistic risk-aware end-to-end multimodal driving framework designed to inject explicit long-tail risk cues into trajectory planning. HERMES employs a foundation-model-assisted annotation pipeline to produce structured Long-Tail Scene Context and Long-Tail Planning Context, capturing hazard-centric cues together with maneuver intent and safety preference, and uses these signals to guide end-to-end planning. HERMES further introduces a Tri-Modal Driving Module that fuses multi-view perception, historical motion cues, and semantic guidance, ensuring risk-aware accurate trajectory planning under long-tail scenarios. Experiments on the real-world long-tail dataset demonstrate that HERMES consistently outperforms representative end-to-end and VLM-driven baselines under long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios. Ablation studies verify the complementary contributions of key components.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00993v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning and Tool-use Compete in Agentic RL:From Quantifying Interference to Disentangled Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00994</link><description>arXiv:2602.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (ARL) focuses on training large language models (LLMs) to interleave reasoning with external tool execution to solve complex tasks. Most existing ARL methods train a single shared model parameters to support both reasoning and tool use behaviors, implicitly assuming that joint training leads to improved overall agent performance. Despite its widespread adoption, this assumption has rarely been examined empirically. In this paper, we systematically investigate this assumption by introducing a Linear Effect Attribution System(LEAS), which provides quantitative evidence of interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors. Through an in-depth analysis, we show that these two capabilities often induce misaligned gradient directions, leading to training interference that undermines the effectiveness of joint optimization and challenges the prevailing ARL paradigm. To address this issue, we propose Disentangled Action Reasoning Tuning(DART), a simple and efficient framework that explicitly decouples parameter updates for reasoning and tool-use via separate low-rank adaptation modules. Experimental results show that DART consistently outperforms baseline methods with averaged 6.35 percent improvements and achieves performance comparable to multi-agent systems that explicitly separate tool-use and reasoning using a single model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00994v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VAMOS-OCTA: Vessel-Aware Multi-Axis Orthogonal Supervision for Inpainting Motion-Corrupted OCT Angiography Volumes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00995</link><description>arXiv:2602.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handheld Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) enables noninvasive retinal imaging in uncooperative or pediatric subjects, but is highly susceptible to motion artifacts that severely degrade volumetric image quality. Sudden motion during 3D acquisition can lead to unsampled retinal regions across entire B-scans (cross-sectional slices), resulting in blank bands in en face projections. We propose VAMOS-OCTA, a deep learning framework for inpainting motion-corrupted B-scans using vessel-aware multi-axis supervision. We employ a 2.5D U-Net architecture that takes a stack of neighboring B-scans as input to reconstruct a corrupted center B-scan, guided by a novel Vessel-Aware Multi-Axis Orthogonal Supervision (VAMOS) loss. This loss combines vessel-weighted intensity reconstruction with axial and lateral projection consistency, encouraging vascular continuity in native B-scans and across orthogonal planes. Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on restoring the en face MIP, VAMOS-OCTA jointly enhances both cross-sectional B-scan sharpness and volumetric projection accuracy, even under severe motion corruptions. We trained our model on both synthetic and real-world corrupted volumes and evaluated its performance using both perceptual quality and pixel-wise accuracy metrics. VAMOS-OCTA consistently outperforms prior methods, producing reconstructions with sharp capillaries, restored vessel continuity, and clean en face projections. These results demonstrate that multi-axis supervision offers a powerful constraint for restoring motion-degraded 3D OCTA data.

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) is a powerful approach for extracting performance from large language models without modifying their weights. Many existing methods rely on trial-and-error, testing different prompts or in-context examples until a good configuration emerges, often consuming substantial compute. Recently, natural language feedback derived from execution logs has shown promise as a way to identify how prompts can be improved. However, most prior approaches operate in a bottom-up manner, iteratively adjusting the prompt based on feedback from individual problems, which can cause them to lose the global perspective. In this work, we propose Error Taxonomy-Guided Prompt Optimization (ETGPO), a prompt optimization algorithm that adopts a top-down approach. ETGPO focuses on the global failure landscape by collecting model errors, categorizing them into a taxonomy, and augmenting the prompt with guidance targeting the most frequent failure modes. Across multiple benchmarks spanning mathematics, question answering, and logical reasoning, ETGPO achieves accuracy that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods, while requiring roughly one third of the optimization-phase token usage and evaluation budget.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00997v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reliable Use of Lemmas via Eligibility Reasoning and Section$-$Aware Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00998</link><description>arXiv:2602.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on mathematical benchmarks yet often misapply lemmas, importing conclusions without validating assumptions. We formalize lemma$-$judging as a structured prediction task: given a statement and a candidate lemma, the model must output a precondition check and a conclusion$-$utility check, from which a usefulness decision is derived. We present RULES, which encodes this specification via a two$-$section output and trains with reinforcement learning plus section$-$aware loss masking to assign penalty to the section responsible for errors. Training and evaluation draw on diverse natural language and formal proof corpora; robustness is assessed with a held$-$out perturbation suite; and end$-$to$-$end evaluation spans competition$-$style, perturbation$-$aligned, and theorem$-$based problems across various LLMs. Results show consistent in$-$domain gains over both a vanilla model and a single$-$label RL baseline, larger improvements on applicability$-$breaking perturbations, and parity or modest gains on end$-$to$-$end tasks; ablations indicate that the two$-$section outputs and section$-$aware reinforcement are both necessary for robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00998v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CortiNet: A Physics-Perception Hybrid Cortical-Inspired Dual-Stream Network for Gallbladder Disease Diagnosis from Ultrasound</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01000</link><description>arXiv:2602.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is the primary diagnostic modality for detecting Gallbladder diseases due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and wide accessibility. However, the low resolution and speckle noise inherent to ultrasound images hinder diagnostic reliability, prompting the use of large convolutional neural networks that are difficult to deploy in routine clinical settings. In this work, we propose CortiNet, a lightweight, cortical-inspired dual-stream neural architecture for gallbladder disease diagnosis that integrates physically interpretable multi-scale signal decomposition with perception-driven feature learning. Inspired by parallel processing pathways in the human visual cortex, CortiNet explicitly separates low-frequency structural information from high-frequency perceptual details and processes them through specialized encoding streams. By operating directly on structured, frequency-selective representations rather than raw pixel intensities, the architecture embeds strong physics-based inductive bias, enabling efficient feature learning with a significantly reduced parameter footprint. A late-stage cortical-style fusion mechanism integrates complementary structural and textural cues while preserving computational efficiency. Additionally, we propose a structure-aware explainability framework wherein gradient-weighted class activation mapping is only applied to the structural branch of the proposed CortiNet architecture. This choice allows the model to only focus on the structural features, making it robust against speckle noise. We evaluate CortiNet on 10,692 expert-annotated images spanning nine clinically relevant gallbladder disease categories. Experimental results demonstrate that CortiNet achieves high diagnostic accuracy (98.74%) with only a fraction of the parameters required by conventional deep convolutional models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How RLHF Amplifies Sycophancy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01002</link><description>arXiv:2602.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often exhibit increased sycophantic behavior after preference-based post-training, showing a stronger tendency to affirm a user's stated or implied belief even when this conflicts with factual accuracy or sound judgment. We present a formal analysis of how alignment from human feedback can increase this failure mode by identifying an explicit amplification mechanism that causally links optimization against a learned reward to bias in the human preference data used for alignment. We show that the direction of behavioral drift is determined by a covariance under the base policy between endorsing the belief signal in the prompt and the learned reward, and that the first-order effect reduces to a simple mean-gap condition. We then analyze reward learning from pairwise comparisons under random utility models like Bradley-Terry and characterize when bias in human annotators' preferences induces this reward gap. Next, we propose a training-time intervention designed to neutralize the amplification mechanism itself. Among all post-trained policies that prevent sycophantic behavior from increasing, we characterize the unique policy closest in KL divergence to the unconstrained post-trained policy, and derive the corresponding minimal reward correction as a closed-form agreement penalty. Computational experiments find that reward gaps are common and cause behavioral drift in all the configurations considered.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ESSAM: A Novel Competitive Evolution Strategies Approach to Reinforcement Learning for Memory Efficient LLMs Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01003</link><description>arXiv:2602.01003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key training step for improving mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but it often has high GPU memory usage, which makes it hard to use in settings with limited resources. To reduce these issues, we propose Evolution Strategies with Sharpness-Aware Maximization (ESSAM), a full parameter fine-tuning framework that tightly combines the zero-order search in parameter space from Evolution Strategies (ES) with the Sharpness-Aware Maximization (SAM) to improve generalization. We conduct fine-tuning experiments on the mainstream mathematica reasoning task GSM8K. The results show that ESSAM achieves an average accuracy of 78.27\% across all models and its overall performance is comparable to RL methods. It surpasses classic RL algorithm PPO with an accuracy of 77.72\% and is comparable to GRPO with an accuracy of 78.34\%, and even surpassing them on some models. In terms of GPU memory usage, ESSAM reduces the average GPU memory usage by $18\times$ compared to PPO and by $10\times$ compared to GRPO, achieving an extremely low GPU memory usage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01003v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SRVAU-R1: Enhancing Video Anomaly Understanding via Reflection-Aware Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01004</link><description>arXiv:2602.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in reasoning capabilities and shown promising effectiveness in video anomaly understanding (VAU) tasks. However, existing MLLM-based approaches remain largely focused on surface-level descriptions of anomalies, lacking deep reasoning over abnormal behaviors like explicit self-reflection and self-correction. To address that, we propose Self-Reflection-Enhanced Reasoning for Video Anomaly Understanding (SRVAU-R1), a reflection-aware learning framework that incorporates reflection in MLLM reasoning. Specifically, SRVAU-R1 introduces the first reflection-oriented Chain-of-Thought dataset tailored for VAU, providing structured supervision with initial reasoning, self-reflection, and revised reasoning. Based on that, it includes a novel reflection-aware learning paradigm with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance multi-modal reasoning for VAU. Extensive experiments on multiple video anomaly benchmarks demonstrate that SRVAU-R1 consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements in both temporal anomaly localization accuracy and reasoning quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01004v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Anemia Among Under-Five Children in Nepal Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01005</link><description>arXiv:2602.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Childhood anemia remains a major public health challenge in Nepal and is associated with impaired growth, cognition, and increased morbidity. Using World Health Organization hemoglobin thresholds, we defined anemia status for children aged 6-59 months and formulated a binary classification task by grouping all anemia severities as \emph{anemic} versus \emph{not anemic}. We analyzed Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS 2022) microdata comprising 1,855 children and initially considered 48 candidate features spanning demographic, socioeconomic, maternal, and child health characteristics. To obtain a stable and substantiated feature set, we applied four features selection techniques (Chi-square, mutual information, point-biserial correlation, and Boruta) and prioritized features supported by multi-method consensus. Five features: child age, recent fever, household size, maternal anemia, and parasite deworming were consistently selected by all methods, while amenorrhea, ethnicity indicators, and provinces were frequently retained. We then compared eight traditional machine learning classifiers (LR, KNN, DT, RF, XGBoost, SVM, NB, LDA) with two deep learning models (DNN and TabNet) using standard evaluation metrics, emphasizing F1-score and recall due to class imbalance. Among all models, logistic regression attained the best recall (0.701) and the highest F1-score (0.649), while DNN achieved the highest accuracy (0.709), and SVM yielded the strongest discrimination with the highest AUC (0.736). Overall, the results indicate that both machine learning and deep learning models can provide competitive anemia prediction and the interpretable features such as child age, infection proxy, maternal anemia, and deworming history are central for risk stratification and public health screening in Nepal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01005v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distilling Token-Trained Models into Byte-Level Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01007</link><description>arXiv:2602.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Byte Language Models (BLMs) have emerged as a promising direction for scaling language models beyond tokenization. However, existing BLMs typically require training from scratch on trillions of bytes, making them prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient distillation recipe that converts existing token-trained LLMs into BLMs while retaining comparable capabilities. Our recipe follows a two-stage curriculum: (1) Progressive Knowledge Distillation, which aligns byte-level representations with the embeddings of the token-trained teacher model; and (2) Byte-Level Supervised Fine-Tuning, which enables end-to-end generation entirely in the byte space. We validate our approach across multiple model families, including Llama, Qwen, and OLMo, and demonstrate that the distilled BLMs retain most of the teacher models' performance using only approximately 125B bytes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LASS-ODE: Scaling ODE Computations to Connect Foundation Models with Dynamical Physical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01009</link><description>arXiv:2602.01009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have transformed language, vision, and time series data analysis, yet progress on dynamic predictions for physical systems remains limited. Given the complexity of physical constraints, two challenges stand out. $(i)$ Physics-computation scalability: physics-informed learning can enforce physical regularization, but its computation (e.g., ODE integration) does not scale to extensive systems. $(ii)$ Knowledge-sharing efficiency: the attention mechanism is primarily computed within each system, which limits the extraction of shared ODE structures across systems. We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems. The resulting model, termed LASS-ODE (\underline{LA}rge-\underline{S}cale \underline{S}mall \underline{ODE}), is pretrained on our $40$GB ODE trajectory collections to enable strong in-domain performance, zero-shot generalization across diverse ODE systems, and additional improvements through fine-tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01009v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Teams Hold Experts Back</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01011</link><description>arXiv:2602.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems are increasingly deployed as autonomous collaborators, where agents interact freely rather than execute fixed, pre-specified workflows. In such settings, effective coordination cannot be fully designed in advance and must instead emerge through interaction. However, most prior work enforces coordination through fixed roles, workflows, or aggregation rules, leaving open the question of how well self-organizing teams perform when coordination is unconstrained. Drawing on organizational psychology, we study whether self-organizing LLM teams achieve strong synergy, where team performance matches or exceeds the best individual member. Across human-inspired and frontier ML benchmarks, we find that -- unlike human teams -- LLM teams consistently fail to match their expert agent's performance, even when explicitly told who the expert is, incurring performance losses of up to 37.6%. Decomposing this failure, we show that expert leveraging, rather than identification, is the primary bottleneck. Conversational analysis reveals a tendency toward integrative compromise -- averaging expert and non-expert views rather than appropriately weighting expertise -- which increases with team size and correlates negatively with performance. Interestingly, this consensus-seeking behavior improves robustness to adversarial agents, suggesting a trade-off between alignment and effective expertise utilization. Our findings reveal a significant gap in the ability of self-organizing multi-agent teams to harness the collective expertise of their members.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01011v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LocalScore: Local Density-Aware Similarity Scoring for Biometrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01012</link><description>arXiv:2602.01012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set biometrics faces challenges with probe subjects who may not be enrolled in the gallery, as traditional biometric systems struggle to detect these non-mated probes. Despite the growing prevalence of multi-sample galleries in real-world deployments, most existing methods collapse intra-subject variability into a single global representation, leading to suboptimal decision boundaries and poor open-set robustness. To address this issue, we propose LocalScore, a simple yet effective scoring algorithm that explicitly incorporates the local density of the gallery feature distribution using the k-th nearest neighbors. LocalScore is architecture-agnostic, loss-independent, and incurs negligible computational overhead, making it a plug-and-play solution for existing biometric systems. Extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that LocalScore consistently achieves substantial gains in open-set retrieval (FNIR@FPIR reduced from 53% to 40%) and verification (TAR@FAR improved from 51% to 74%). We further provide theoretical analysis and empirical validation explaining when and why the method achieves the most significant gains based on dataset characteristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01012v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Data Centers Load Risks and Enabling Grid Support Functions through Grid-Forming Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01013</link><description>arXiv:2602.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of hyperscale data centers driven by Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence workloads has introduced new challenges for power systems. These facilities experience abrupt power variations during model training and check-point-saving events, causing voltage deviations and frequency disturbances. Moreover, they operate as passive loads that draw power without offering any grid support. This paper presents an integrated architecture that combines Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) within data centers using Grid-Forming inverters to provide active grid-support functions. Simulation results through MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate accurate power reference tracking under dynamic loading, with eight coordinated BESS units supplying instantaneous power during training and saving conditions. Under single-phase voltage depression near the data center bus, the BESS delivered reactive power support similar to a Static Synchronous Compensator. During grid disconnection, seamless islanded operation was achieved with stable voltage, frequency, and continuous power delivery at the data center bus.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01013v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Models as Students Who Think Aloud: Overly Coherent, Verbose, and Confident</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01015</link><description>arXiv:2602.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in AI-based tutoring systems. Can they faithfully model novice reasoning and metacognitive judgments? Existing evaluations emphasize problem-solving accuracy, overlooking the fragmented and imperfect reasoning that characterizes human learning. We evaluate LLMs as novices using 630 think-aloud utterances from multi-step chemistry tutoring problems with problem-solving logs of student hint use, attempts, and problem context. We compare LLM-generated reasoning to human learner utterances under minimal and extended contextual prompting, and assess the models' ability to predict step-level learner success. Although GPT-4.1 generates fluent and contextually appropriate continuations, its reasoning is systematically over-coherent, verbose, and less variable than human think-alouds. These effects intensify with a richer problem-solving context during prompting. Learner performance was consistently overestimated. These findings highlight epistemic limitations of simulating learning with LLMs. We attribute these limitations to LLM training data, including expert-like solutions devoid of expressions of affect and working memory constraints during problem solving. Our evaluation framework can guide future design of adaptive systems that more faithfully support novice learning and self-regulation using generative artificial intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01015v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Does Unfaithful Reasoning Emerge from Autoregressive Training?

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning generated by large language models (LLMs) is often unfaithful: intermediate steps can be logically inconsistent or fail to reflect the causal relationship leading to the final answer. Despite extensive empirical observations, a fundamental understanding of CoT is lacking--what constitutes faithful CoT reasoning, and how unfaithfulness emerges from autoregressive training. We study these questions using well-controlled synthetic experiments, training small transformers on noisy data to solve modular arithmetic expressions step by step, a task we term Arithmetic Expression Reasoning. We find that models can learn faithful reasoning that causally follows the underlying arithmetic rules, but only when the training noise is below a critical threshold, a phenomenon attributable to simplicity bias. At higher noise levels, training dynamics exhibit a transition from faithful stepwise reasoning to unfaithful skip-step reasoning via an intermediate mixed mode characterized by a transient increase in prediction entropy. Mechanistic analysis reveals that models learn to encode internal uncertainty by resolving inconsistent reasoning steps, which suggests the emergence of implicit self-verification from autoregressive training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01017v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Offline Discovery of Interpretable Skills from Multi-Task Trajectories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01018</link><description>arXiv:2602.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical Imitation Learning is a powerful paradigm for acquiring complex robot behaviors from demonstrations. A central challenge, however, lies in discovering reusable skills from long-horizon, multi-task offline data, especially when the data lacks explicit rewards or subtask annotations. In this work, we introduce LOKI, a three-stage end-to-end learning framework designed for offline skill discovery and hierarchical imitation. The framework commences with a two-stage, weakly supervised skill discovery process: Stage one performs coarse, task-aware macro-segmentation by employing an alignment-enforced Vector Quantized VAE guided by weak task labels. Stage two then refines these segments at a micro-level using a self-supervised sequential model, followed by an iterative clustering process to consolidate skill boundaries. The third stage then leverages these precise boundaries to construct a hierarchical policy within an option-based framework-complete with a learned termination condition beta for explicit skill switching. LOKI achieves high success rates on the challenging D4RL Kitchen benchmark and outperforms standard HIL baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the discovered skills are semantically meaningful, aligning with human intuition, and exhibit compositionality by successfully sequencing them to solve a novel, unseen task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Effectiveness of Automatically Curated Dataset in Thyroid Nodules Classification Algorithms Using Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01020</link><description>arXiv:2602.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diagnosis of thyroid nodule cancers commonly utilizes ultrasound images. Several studies showed that deep learning algorithms designed to classify benign and malignant thyroid nodules could match radiologists' performance. However, data availability for training deep learning models is often limited due to the significant effort required to curate such datasets. The previous study proposed a method to curate thyroid nodule datasets automatically. It was tested to have a 63% yield rate and 83% accuracy. However, the usefulness of the generated data for training deep learning models remains unknown. In this study, we conducted experiments to determine whether using a automatically-curated dataset improves deep learning algorithms' performance. We trained deep learning models on the manually annotated and automatically-curated datasets. We also trained with a smaller subset of the automatically-curated dataset that has higher accuracy to explore the optimum usage of such dataset. As a result, the deep learning model trained on the manually selected dataset has an AUC of 0.643 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62, 0.66). It is significantly lower than the AUC of the 6automatically-curated dataset trained deep learning model, 0.694 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67, 0.73, P &lt; .001). The AUC of the accurate subset trained deep learning model is 0.689 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.72, P &gt; .43), which is insignificantly worse than the AUC of the full automatically-curated dataset. In conclusion, we showed that using a automatically-curated dataset can substantially increase the performance of deep learning algorithms, and it is suggested to use all the data rather than only using the accurate subset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unifying Ranking and Generation in Query Auto-Completion via Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Multi-Objective Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01023</link><description>arXiv:2602.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query Auto-Completion (QAC) suggests query completions as users type, helping them articulate intent and reach results more efficiently. Existing approaches face fundamental challenges: traditional retrieve-and-rank pipelines have limited long-tail coverage and require extensive feature engineering, while recent generative methods suffer from hallucination and safety risks. We present a unified framework that reformulates QAC as end-to-end list generation through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-objective Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) reformulating QAC as end-to-end list generation with multi-objective optimization; (2) defining and deploying a suite of rule-based, model-based, and LLM-as-judge verifiers for QAC, and using them in a comprehensive methodology that combines RAG, multi-objective DPO, and iterative critique-revision for high-quality synthetic data; (3) a hybrid serving architecture enabling efficient production deployment under strict latency constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale commercial search platform demonstrates substantial improvements: offline metrics show gains across all dimensions, human evaluation yields +0.40 to +0.69 preference scores, and a controlled online experiment achieves 5.44\% reduction in keystrokes and 3.46\% increase in suggestion adoption, validating that unified generation with RAG and multi-objective alignment provides an effective solution for production QAC. This work represents a paradigm shift to end-to-end generation powered by large language models, RAG, and multi-objective alignment, establishing a production-validated framework that can benefit the broader search and recommendation industry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01023v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Low-latency Federated LLM Fine-tuning Over Wireless Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01024</link><description>arXiv:2602.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, federated large language models (LLMs) have drawn significant attention thanks to coupled capabilities of LLMs and federated learning (FL) that address privacy concerns in collaborative fine-tuning. However, due to large-scale parameters of LLMs, existing federated LLM fine-tuning frameworks incur significant challenges in resource-constrained clients characterized by heterogeneous computing capabilities and random wireless channels. To address this issue, we propose a joint client-specific pruning and bandwidth allocation (JCPBA) framework for federated LLMs to improve the fine-tuning efficiency over the wireless networks. Specifically, we formulate a fine-tuning latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing pruning rates and bandwidth allocations. Furthermore, we solve this optimization problem using a block coordinate descent method. Extensive experiments on the datasets of Yahoo Answers and GSM8K demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces wall-clock fine-tuning time compared with state-of-the-art baselines and gains equal or lower test loss at the cost of lower computation and communication overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01024v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Universal and Transferable Jailbreak Attacks on Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01025</link><description>arXiv:2602.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with vision encoders, enabling text generation conditioned on both images and text. However, this multimodal integration expands the attack surface by exposing the model to image-based jailbreaks crafted to induce harmful responses. Existing gradient-based jailbreak methods transfer poorly, as adversarial patterns overfit to a single white-box surrogate and fail to generalise to black-box models. In this work, we propose Universal and transferable jailbreak (UltraBreak), a framework that constrains adversarial patterns through transformations and regularisation in the vision space, while relaxing textual targets through semantic-based objectives. By defining its loss in the textual embedding space of the target LLM, UltraBreak discovers universal adversarial patterns that generalise across diverse jailbreak objectives. This combination of vision-level regularisation and semantically guided textual supervision mitigates surrogate overfitting and enables strong transferability across both models and attack targets. Extensive experiments show that UltraBreak consistently outperforms prior jailbreak methods. Further analysis reveals why earlier approaches fail to transfer, highlighting that smoothing the loss landscape via semantic objectives is crucial for enabling universal and transferable jailbreaks.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel theoretical framework, the Stacked Autoencoder Evolution Hypothesis, which proposes that biological evolutionary systems operate through multi-layered self-encoding and decoding processes, analogous to stacked autoencoders in deep learning. Rather than viewing evolution solely as gradual changes driven by mutation and selection, this hypothesis suggests that self-replication inherently compresses and reconstructs genetic information across hierarchical layers of abstraction. This layered structure enables evolutionary systems to explore diverse possibilities not only at the sequence level but also across progressively more abstract layers of representation, making it possible for even simple mutations to navigate these higher-order spaces.Such a mechanism may explain punctuated evolutionary patterns and changes that can appear as if they are goal-directed in natural evolution, by allowing mutations at deeper latent layers to trigger sudden, large-scale phenotypic shifts. To illustrate the plausibility of this mechanism, artificial chemistry simulations were conducted, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of hierarchical autoencoder structures. This framework offers a new perspective on the informational dynamics underlying both continuous and discontinuous evolutionary change.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SFMP: Fine-Grained, Hardware-Friendly and Search-Free Mixed-Precision Quantization for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01027</link><description>arXiv:2602.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization is a promising approach for compressing large language models under tight memory budgets. However, existing mixed-precision methods typically suffer from one of two limitations: they either rely on expensive discrete optimization to determine precision allocation, or introduce hardware inefficiencies due to irregular memory layouts. We propose SFMP, a search-free and hardware-friendly mixed-precision quantization framework for large language models. The framework is built upon four novel ideas: Fractional bit-width, which extends integer bit-width for weight matrix to fractional value and transforms discrete precision allocation as a continuous problem; 2)Block-wise mixed-precision, enabling fine-grained precision within weight matrices while remaining hardware-friendly; 3)Row-column weight reordering, which aggregates salient weights via row and column reordering, incurring only a small activation reordering overhead during inference; 4)Unified GEMM kernel, which supports mixed-precision GEMM at arbitrary average bit-width. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFMP outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise mixed-precision methods under the same memory constraints, while significantly reducing quantization cost and improving inference efficiency.

Abstract: This work presents the first systematic investigation of speech bias in multilingual MLLMs. We construct and release the BiasInEar dataset, a speech-augmented benchmark based on Global MMLU Lite, spanning English, Chinese, and Korean, balanced by gender and accent, and totaling 70.8 hours ($\approx$4,249 minutes) of speech with 11,200 questions. Using four complementary metrics (accuracy, entropy, APES, and Fleiss' $\kappa$), we evaluate nine representative models under linguistic (language and accent), demographic (gender), and structural (option order) perturbations. Our findings reveal that MLLMs are relatively robust to demographic factors but highly sensitive to language and option order, suggesting that speech can amplify existing structural biases. Moreover, architectural design and reasoning strategy substantially affect robustness across languages. Overall, this study establishes a unified framework for assessing fairness and robustness in speech-integrated LLMs, bridging the gap between text- and speech-based evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still produce plausible-sounding but ungrounded factual claims, a problem that worsens in multi-turn dialogue as context grows and early errors cascade. We introduce $\textbf{HalluHard}$, a challenging multi-turn hallucination benchmark with 950 seed questions spanning four high-stakes domains: legal cases, research questions, medical guidelines, and coding. We operationalize groundedness by requiring inline citations for factual assertions. To support reliable evaluation in open-ended settings, we propose a judging pipeline that iteratively retrieves evidence via web search. It can fetch, filter, and parse full-text sources (including PDFs) to assess whether cited material actually supports the generated content. Across a diverse set of frontier proprietary and open-weight models, hallucinations remain substantial even with web search ($\approx 30\%$ for the strongest configuration, Opus-4.5 with web search), with content-grounding errors persisting at high rates. Finally, we show that hallucination behavior is shaped by model capacity, turn position, effective reasoning, and the type of knowledge required.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HierCon: Hierarchical Contrastive Attention for Audio Deepfake Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01032</link><description>arXiv:2602.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfakes generated by modern TTS and voice conversion systems are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real speech, raising serious risks for security and online trust. While state-of-the-art self-supervised models provide rich multi-layer representations, existing detectors treat layers independently and overlook temporal and hierarchical dependencies critical for identifying synthetic artefacts. We propose HierCon, a hierarchical layer attention framework combined with margin-based contrastive learning that models dependencies across temporal frames, neighbouring layers, and layer groups, while encouraging domain-invariant embeddings. Evaluated on ASVspoof 2021 DF and In-the-Wild datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance (1.93% and 6.87% EER), improving over independent layer weighting by 36.6% and 22.5% respectively. The results and attention visualisations confirm that hierarchical modelling enhances generalisation to cross-domain generation techniques and recording conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01032v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GMAC: Global Multi-View Constraint for Automatic Multi-Camera Extrinsic Calibration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01033</link><description>arXiv:2602.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic calibration of multi-camera systems, namely the accurate estimation of spatial extrinsic parameters, is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, panoramic perception, and multi-view data fusion. Existing methods typically rely on calibration targets, explicit geometric modeling, or task-specific neural networks. Such approaches often exhibit limited robustness and applicability in complex dynamic environments or online scenarios, making them difficult to deploy in practical applications. To address this, this paper proposes GMAC, a multi-camera extrinsic estimation framework based on the implicit geometric representations learned by multi-view reconstruction networks. GMAC models extrinsics as global variables constrained by the latent multi-view geometric structure and prunes and structurally reconfigures existing networks so that their latent features can directly support extrinsic prediction through a lightweight regression head, without requiring a completely new network design. Furthermore, GMAC jointly optimizes cross-view reprojection consistency and multi-view cycle consistency, ensuring geometric coherence across cameras while improving prediction accuracy and optimization stability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-camera datasets demonstrate that GMAC achieves accurate and stable extrinsic estimation without explicit 3D reconstruction or manual calibration, providing a new solution for efficient deployment and online calibration of multi-camera systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01033v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discovering Process-Outcome Credit in Multi-Step LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01034</link><description>arXiv:2602.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) serves as a potent paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet standard outcome-based approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework designed to provide continuous reward signals, which introduces a Step-wise Marginal Information Gain (MIG) mechanism that quantifies the intrinsic value of reasoning steps against a Monotonic Historical Watermark, effectively filtering out training noise. To ensure disentangled credit distribution, we implement a Decoupled Masking Strategy, applying process-oriented rewards specifically to the chain-of-thought (CoT) and outcome-oriented rewards to the full completion. Additionally, we incorporate a Dual-Gated SFT objective to stabilize training with high-quality structural and factual signals. Extensive experiments across textual and multi-modal benchmarks (e.g., MATH, Super-CLEVR) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines such as GRPO in both sample efficiency and final accuracy. Furthermore, our model exhibits superior out-of-distribution robustness, demonstrating promising zero-shot transfer capabilities to unseen and challenging reasoning tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FUSE-Flow: Scalable Real-Time Multi-View Point Cloud Reconstruction Using Confidence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01035</link><description>arXiv:2602.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time multi-view point cloud reconstruction is a core problem in 3D vision and immersive perception, with wide applications in VR, AR, robotic navigation, digital twins, and computer interaction. Despite advances in multi-camera systems and high-resolution depth sensors, fusing large-scale multi-view depth observations into high-quality point clouds under strict real-time constraints remains challenging. Existing methods relying on voxel-based fusion, temporal accumulation, or global optimization suffer from high computational complexity, excessive memory usage, and limited scalability, failing to simultaneously achieve real-time performance, reconstruction quality, and multi-camera extensibility. We propose FUSE-Flow, a frame-wise, stateless, and linearly scalable point cloud streaming reconstruction framework. Each frame independently generates point cloud fragments, fused via two weights, measurement confidence and 3D distance consistency to suppress noise while preserving geometric details. For large-scale multi-camera efficiency, we introduce an adaptive spatial hashing-based weighted aggregation method: 3D space is adaptively partitioned by local point cloud density, representative points are selected per cell, and weighted fusion is performed to handle both sparse and dense regions. With GPU parallelization, FUSE-Flow achieves high-throughput, low-latency point cloud generation and fusion with linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate that the framework improves reconstruction stability and geometric fidelity in overlapping, depth-discontinuous, and dynamic scenes, while maintaining real-time frame rates on modern GPUs, verifying its effectiveness, robustness, and scalability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01035v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VEQ: Modality-Adaptive Quantization for MoE Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01037</link><description>arXiv:2602.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer remarkable performance but incur prohibitive memory and computational costs, making compression essential. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective training-free technique to address the massive memory and computation overhead. Existing quantization paradigms fall short as they are oblivious to two critical forms of heterogeneity: the inherent discrepancy between vision and language tokens, and the non-uniform contribution of different experts. To bridge this gap, we propose Visual Expert Quantization (VEQ), a dual-aware quantization framework designed to simultaneously accommodate cross-modal differences and heterogeneity between experts. Specifically, VEQ incorporates 1)Modality-expert-aware Quantization, which utilizes expert activation frequency to prioritize error minimization for pivotal experts, and 2)Modality-affinity-aware Quantization, which constructs an enhanced Hessian matrix by integrating token-expert affinity with modality information to guide the calibration process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verify that VEQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, under the W3A16 configuration, our method achieves significant average accuracy gains of 2.04\% on Kimi-VL and 3.09\% on Qwen3-VL compared to the previous SOTA quantization methods, demonstrating superior robustness across various multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Many everyday tasks, ranging from appliance repair and cooking to car maintenance, require expert knowledge, particularly for complex, multi-step procedures. Despite growing interest in AI agents for augmented reality (AR) assistance, progress remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale multimodal conversational datasets grounded in real-world task execution, in part due to the cost and logistical complexity of human-assisted data collection. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically transform single person instructional videos into two-person multimodal task-guidance conversations. Our fully automatic pipeline, based on large language models, provides a scalable and cost efficient alternative to traditional data collection approaches. Using this framework, we introduce HowToDIV, a multimodal dataset comprising 507 conversations, 6,636 question answer pairs, and 24 hours of video spanning multiple domains. Each session consists of a multi-turn expert-novice interaction. Finally, we report baseline results using Gemma 3 and Qwen 2.5 on HowToDIV, providing an initial benchmark for multimodal procedural task assistance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01038v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Dual-Weighting Framework for Federated Learning via Out-of-Distribution Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01039</link><description>arXiv:2602.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across large-scale distributed service nodes while preserving data privacy, making it a cornerstone of intelligent service systems in edge-cloud environments. However, in real-world service-oriented deployments, data generated by heterogeneous users, devices, and application scenarios are inherently non-IID. This severe data heterogeneity critically undermines the convergence stability, generalization ability, and ultimately the quality of service delivered by the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FLood, a novel FL framework inspired by out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. FLood dynamically counteracts the adverse effects of heterogeneity through a dual-weighting mechanism that jointly governs local training and global aggregation. At the client level, it adaptively reweights the supervised loss by upweighting pseudo-OOD samples, thereby encouraging more robust learning from distributionally misaligned or challenging data. At the server level, it refines model aggregation by weighting client contributions according to their OOD confidence scores, prioritizing updates from clients with higher in-distribution consistency and enhancing the global model's robustness and convergence stability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks under diverse non-IID settings demonstrate that FLood consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, FLood functions as an orthogonal plug-in module: it seamlessly integrates with existing FL algorithms to boost their performance under heterogeneity without modifying their core optimization logic. These properties make FLood a practical and scalable solution for deploying reliable intelligent services in real-world federated environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01039v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Adaptive Cross-Embodiment Visuomotor Policy with Contrastive Prompt Orchestration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01040</link><description>arXiv:2602.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning adaptive visuomotor policies for embodied agents remains a formidable challenge, particularly when facing cross-embodiment variations such as diverse sensor configurations and dynamic properties. Conventional learning approaches often struggle to separate task-relevant features from domain-specific variations (e.g., lighting, field-of-view, and rotation), leading to poor sample efficiency and catastrophic failure in unseen environments. To bridge this gap, we propose ContrAstive Prompt Orchestration (CAPO), a novel approach for learning visuomotor policies that integrates contrastive prompt learning and adaptive prompt orchestration. For prompt learning, we devise a hybrid contrastive learning strategy that integrates visual, temporal action, and text objectives to establish a pool of learnable prompts, where each prompt induces a visual representation encapsulating fine-grained domain factors. Based on these learned prompts, we introduce an adaptive prompt orchestration mechanism that dynamically aggregates these prompts conditioned on current observations. This enables the agent to adaptively construct optimal state representations by identifying dominant domain factors instantaneously. Consequently, the policy optimization is effectively shielded from irrelevant interference, preventing the common issue of overfitting to source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Crucially, it exhibits superior zero-shot adaptation across unseen target domains characterized by drastic environmental (e.g., illumination) and physical shifts (e.g., field-of-view and rotation), validating its effectiveness as a viable solution for cross-embodiment visuomotor policy adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01040v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Based Behavior Tree Generation for Construction Machinery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01041</link><description>arXiv:2602.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthwork operations are facing an increasing demand, while workforce aging and skill loss create a pressing need for automation. ROS2-TMS for Construction, a Cyber-Physical System framework designed to coordinate construction machinery, has been proposed for autonomous operation; however, its reliance on manually designed Behavior Trees (BTs) limits scalability, particularly in scenarios involving heterogeneous machine cooperation. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for task planning and BT generation. However, most existing approaches remain confined to simulations or simple manipulators, with relatively few applications demonstrated in real-world contexts, such as complex construction sites involving multiple machines. This paper proposes an LLM-based workflow for BT generation, introducing synchronization flags to enable safe and cooperative operation. The workflow consists of two steps: high-level planning, where the LLM generates synchronization flags, and BT generation using structured templates. Safety is ensured by planning with parameters stored in the system database. The proposed method is validated in simulation and further demonstrated through real-world experiments, highlighting its potential to advance automation in civil engineering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Condensation of Block Sensitivity, Certificate Complexity and the $\mathsf{AND}$ (and $\mathsf{OR}$) Decision Tree Complexity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01042</link><description>arXiv:2602.01042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $n$-bit Boolean function with a complexity measure (such as block sensitivity, query complexity, etc.) $M(f) = k$, the hardness condensation question asks whether $f$ can be restricted to $O(k)$ variables such that the complexity measure is $\Omega(k)$?
  In this work, we study the condensability of block sensitivity, certificate complexity, AND (and OR) query complexity and Fourier sparsity. We show that block sensitivity does not condense under restrictions, unlike sensitivity: there exists a Boolean function $f$ with query complexity $k$ such that any restriction of $f$ to $O(k)$ variables has block sensitivity $O(k^{\frac{2}{3}})$. This answers an open question in G\"o\"os, Newman, Riazanov, and Sokolov (2024) in the negative. The same function yields an analogous incondensable result for certificate complexity. We further show that $\mathsf{AND}$(and $\mathsf{OR}$) decision trees are also incondensable. In contrast, we prove that Fourier sparsity admits a weak form of condensation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Morphis: SLO-Aware Resource Scheduling for Microservices with Time-Varying Call Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01044</link><description>arXiv:2602.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern microservice systems exhibit continuous structural evolution in their runtime call graphs due to workload fluctuations, fault responses, and deployment activities. Despite this complexity, our analysis of over 500,000 production traces from ByteDance reveals a latent regularity: execution paths concentrate around a small set of recurring invocation patterns. However, existing resource management approaches fail to exploit this structure. Industrial autoscalers like Kubernetes HPA ignore inter-service dependencies, while recent academic methods often assume static topologies, rendering them ineffective under dynamic execution contexts. In this work, we propose Morphis, a dependency-aware provisioning framework that unifies pattern-aware trace analysis with global optimization. It introduces structural fingerprinting that decomposes traces into a stable execution backbone and interpretable deviation subgraphs. Then, resource allocation is formulated as a constrained optimization problem over predicted pattern distributions, jointly minimizing aggregate CPU usage while satisfying end-to-end tail-latency SLOs. Our extensive evaluations on the TrainTicket benchmark demonstrate that Morphis reduces CPU consumption by 35-38% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining 98.8% SLO compliance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01044v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Superposition unifies power-law training dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01045</link><description>arXiv:2602.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of feature superposition in the emergence of power-law training dynamics using a teacher-student framework. We first derive an analytic theory for training without superposition, establishing that the power-law training exponent depends on both the input data statistics and channel importance. Remarkably, we discover that a superposition bottleneck induces a transition to a universal power-law exponent of $\sim 1$, independent of data and channel statistics. This one over time training with superposition represents an up to tenfold acceleration compared to the purely sequential learning that takes place in the absence of superposition. Our finding that superposition leads to rapid training with a data-independent power law exponent may have important implications for a wide range of neural networks that employ superposition, including production-scale large language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01045v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReLayout: Versatile and Structure-Preserving Design Layout Editing via Relation-Aware Design Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01046</link><description>arXiv:2602.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated redesign without manual adjustments marks a key step forward in the design workflow. In this work, we focus on a foundational redesign task termed design layout editing, which seeks to autonomously modify the geometric composition of a design based on user intents. To overcome the ambiguity of user needs expressed in natural language, we introduce four basic and important editing actions and standardize the format of editing operations. The underexplored task presents a unique challenge: satisfying specified editing operations while simultaneously preserving the layout structure of unedited elements. Besides, the scarcity of triplet (original design, editing operation, edited design) samples poses another formidable challenge. To this end, we present ReLayout, a novel framework for versatile and structure-preserving design layout editing that operates without triplet data. Specifically, ReLayout first introduces the relation graph, which contains the position and size relationships among unedited elements, as the constraint for layout structure preservation. Then, relation-aware design reconstruction (RADR) is proposed to bypass the data challenge. By learning to reconstruct a design from its elements, a relation graph, and a synthesized editing operation, RADR effectively emulates the editing process in a self-supervised manner. A multi-modal large language model serves as the backbone for RADR, unifying multiple editing actions within a single model and thus achieving versatile editing after fine-tuning. Qualitative, quantitative results and user studies show that ReLayout significantly outperforms the baseline models in terms of editing quality, accuracy, and layout structure preservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01046v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Residual Decoding: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via History-Aware Residual Guidance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01047</link><description>arXiv:2602.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively from image-text inputs and perform well in various multimodal tasks. Despite this success, they are affected by language priors and often produce hallucinations. Hallucinations denote generated content that is grammatically and syntactically coherent, yet bears no match or direct relevance to actual visual input. To address this problem, we propose Residual Decoding (ResDec). It is a novel training-free method that uses historical information to aid decoding. The method relies on the internal implicit reasoning mechanism and token logits evolution mechanism of LVLMs to correct biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResDec effectively suppresses hallucinations induced by language priors, significantly improves visual grounding, and reduces object hallucinations. In addition to mitigating hallucinations, ResDec also performs exceptionally well on comprehensive LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its broad applicability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Minimizing Inequity in Facility Location Games</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01048</link><description>arXiv:2602.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of minimizing group-level inequity in facility location games on the real line, where agents belong to different groups and may act strategically. We explore a fairness-oriented objective that minimizes the maximum group effect introduced by Marsh and Schilling (1994). Each group's effect is defined as its total or maximum distance to the nearest facility, weighted by group-specific factors. We show that this formulation generalizes several prominent optimization objectives, including the classical utilitarian (social cost) and egalitarian (maximum cost) objectives, as well as two group-fair objectives, maximum total and average group cost. In order to minimize the maximum group effect, we first propose two novel mechanisms for the single-facility case, the BALANCED mechanism and the MAJOR-PHANTOM mechanism. Both are strategyproof and achieve tight approximation guarantees under distinct formulations of the maximum group effect objective. Our mechanisms not only close the existing gap in approximation bounds for group-fairness objectives identified by Zhou, Li, and Chan (2022), but also unify many classical truthful mechanisms within a broader fairness-aware framework. For the two-facility case, we revisit and extend the classical endpoint mechanism to our generalized setting and demonstrate that it provides tight bounds for two distinct maximum group effect objectives.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SwiftRepertoire: Few-Shot Immune-Signature Synthesis via Dynamic Kernel Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01051</link><description>arXiv:2602.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repertoire-level analysis of T cell receptors offers a biologically grounded signal for disease detection and immune monitoring, yet practical deployment is impeded by label sparsity, cohort heterogeneity, and the computational burden of adapting large encoders to new tasks. We introduce a framework that synthesizes compact task-specific parameterizations from a learned dictionary of prototypes conditioned on lightweight task descriptors derived from repertoire probes and pooled embedding statistics. This synthesis produces small adapter modules applied to a frozen pretrained backbone, enabling immediate adaptation to novel tasks with only a handful of support examples and without full model fine-tuning. The architecture preserves interpretability through motif-aware probes and a calibrated motif discovery pipeline that links predictive decisions to sequence-level signals. Together, these components yield a practical, sample-efficient, and interpretable pathway for translating repertoire-informed models into diverse clinical and research settings where labeled data are scarce and computational resources are constrained.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01051v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LRAgent: Efficient KV Cache Sharing for Multi-LoRA LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01053</link><description>arXiv:2602.01053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Role specialization in multi-LLM agent systems is often realized via multi-LoRA, where agents share a pretrained backbone and differ only through lightweight adapters. Despite sharing base model weights, each agent independently builds and stores its own KV cache for the same long, tool-augmented trajectories, incurring substantial memory and compute overhead. Existing KV cache sharing methods largely overlook this multi-LoRA setting. We observe that, across agents, cache differences are dominated by adapter outputs, while activations from the shared pretrained backbone remain highly similar. Based on this observation, we propose LRAgent, a KV cache sharing framework for multi-LoRA agents that decomposes the cache into a shared base component from the pretrained weights and an adapter-dependent component from LoRA weights. LRAgent reduces memory overhead by sharing the base component and storing the adapter component in its inherent low-rank form, and further reduces compute overhead, enabled by shared-$A$ multi-LoRA architectures, by also sharing the low-rank cache and avoiding redundant computations for contexts already processed by other agents. To efficiently reconstruct adapter contributions at runtime, we introduce Flash-LoRA-Attention, a kernel that reorders attention computation to avoid materializing the low-rank cache to full dimension. LRAgent achieves throughput and time-to-first-token latency close to fully shared caching, while preserving accuracy near the non-shared caching baseline across agentic question-answering benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01053v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Baseline Method of the Foundation Model Challenge for Ultrasound Image Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01055</link><description>arXiv:2602.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging exhibits substantial heterogeneity across anatomical structures and acquisition protocols, posing significant challenges to the development of generalizable analysis models. Most existing methods are task-specific, limiting their suitability as clinically deployable foundation models. To address this limitation, the Foundation Model Challenge for Ultrasound Image Analysis (FM\_UIA~2026) introduces a large-scale multi-task benchmark comprising 27 subtasks across segmentation, classification, detection, and regression. In this paper, we present the official baseline for FM\_UIA~2026 based on a unified Multi-Head Multi-Task Learning (MH-MTL) framework that supports all tasks within a single shared network. The model employs an ImageNet-pretrained EfficientNet--B4 backbone for robust feature extraction, combined with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to capture multi-scale contextual information. A task-specific routing strategy enables global tasks to leverage high-level semantic features, while dense prediction tasks exploit spatially detailed FPN representations. Training incorporates a composite loss with task-adaptive learning rate scaling and a cosine annealing schedule. Validation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of this unified design, establishing a strong and extensible baseline for ultrasound foundation model research.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged in computer vision as a promising rendering technique. By adapting the principles of Elliptical Weighted Average (EWA) splatting to a modern differentiable pipeline, 3DGS enables real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis. Building upon this, R2-Gaussian extended the 3DGS paradigm to tomographic reconstruction by rectifying integration bias, achieving state-of-the-art performance in computed tomography (CT). To enable differentiability, R2-Gaussian adopts a local affine approximation: each 3D Gaussian is locally mapped to a 2D Gaussian on the detector and composed via alpha blending to form projections. However, the affine approximation can degrade reconstruction quantitative accuracy and complicate the incorporation of nonlinear geometric corrections. To address these limitations, we propose a tomographic reconstruction framework based on 3D Gaussian ray tracing. Our approach provides two key advantages over splatting-based models: (i) it computes the line integral through 3D Gaussian primitives analytically, avoiding the local affine collapse and thus yielding a more physically consistent forward projection model; and (ii) the ray-tracing formulation gives explicit control over ray origins and directions, which facilitates the precise application of nonlinear geometric corrections, e.g., arc-correction used in positron emission tomography (PET). These properties extend the applicability of Gaussian-based reconstruction to a wider range of realistic tomography systems while improving projection accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01057v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Good SFT Optimizes for SFT, Better SFT Prepares for Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01058</link><description>arXiv:2602.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training of reasoning LLMs is a holistic process that typically consists of an offline SFT stage followed by an online reinforcement learning (RL) stage. However, SFT is often optimized in isolation to maximize SFT performance alone.
  We show that, after identical RL training, models initialized from stronger SFT checkpoints can significantly underperform those initialized from weaker ones. We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.
  We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected.
  We conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen 2.5 and 3 and DeepSeek-distilled models. PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass at 8 gains up to a 14.6 percent on AIME2025. Our results suggest that PEAR is an effective step toward more holistic LLM post-training by designing and evaluating SFT with downstream RL in mind rather than in isolation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01058v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DRFormer: A Dual-Regularized Bidirectional Transformer for Person Re-identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01059</link><description>arXiv:2602.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both fine-grained discriminative details and global semantic features can contribute to solving person re-identification challenges, such as occlusion and pose variations. Vision foundation models (\textit{e.g.}, DINO) excel at mining local textures, and vision-language models (\textit{e.g.}, CLIP) capture strong global semantic difference. Existing methods predominantly rely on a single paradigm, neglecting the potential benefits of their integration. In this paper, we analyze the complementary roles of these two architectures and propose a framework to synergize their strengths by a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{R}egularized Bidirectional \textbf{Transformer} (\textbf{DRFormer}). The dual-regularization mechanism ensures diverse feature extraction and achieves a better balance in the contributions of the two models. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our method effectively harmonizes local and global representations, achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01059v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TLDiffGAN: A Latent Diffusion-GAN Framework with Temporal Information Fusion for Anomalous Sound Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01060</link><description>arXiv:2602.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing generative models for unsupervised anomalous sound detection are limited by their inability to fully capture the complex feature distribution of normal sounds, while the potential of powerful diffusion models in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, TLDiffGAN, which consists of two complementary branches. One branch incorporates a latent diffusion model into the GAN generator for adversarial training, thereby making the discriminator's task more challenging and improving the quality of generated samples. The other branch leverages pretrained audio model encoders to extract features directly from raw audio waveforms for auxiliary discrimination. This framework effectively captures feature representations of normal sounds from both raw audio and Mel spectrograms. Moreover, we introduce a TMixup spectrogram augmentation technique to enhance sensitivity to subtle and localized temporal patterns that are often overlooked. Extensive experiments on the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2 dataset demonstrate the superior detection performance of TLDiffGAN, as well as its strong capability in anomalous time-frequency localization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01060v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SetPO: Set-Level Policy Optimization for Diversity-Preserving LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01062</link><description>arXiv:2602.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has shown notable effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) reasoning performance, especially in mathematics tasks. However, such improvements often come with reduced outcome diversity, where the model concentrates probability mass on a narrow set of solutions. Motivated by diminishing-returns principles, we introduce a set level diversity objective defined over sampled trajectories using kernelized similarity. Our approach derives a leave-one-out marginal contribution for each sampled trajectory and integrates this objective as a plug-in advantage shaping term for policy optimization. We further investigate the contribution of a single trajectory to language model diversity within a distribution perturbation framework. This analysis theoretically confirms a monotonicity property, proving that rarer trajectories yield consistently higher marginal contributions to the global diversity. Extensive experiments across a range of model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, consistently outperforming strong baselines in both Pass@1 and Pass@K across various benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01062v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Personality Expression Across Contexts: Linguistic and Behavioral Variation in LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01063</link><description>arXiv:2602.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be conditioned with explicit personality prompts, yet their behavioral realization often varies depending on context. This study examines how identical personality prompts lead to distinct linguistic, behavioral, and emotional outcomes across four conversational settings: ice-breaking, negotiation, group decision, and empathy tasks. Results show that contextual cues systematically influence both personality expression and emotional tone, suggesting that the same traits are expressed differently depending on social and affective demands. This raises an important question for LLM-based dialogue agents: whether such variations reflect inconsistency or context-sensitive adaptation akin to human behavior. Viewed through the lens of Whole Trait Theory, these findings highlight that LLMs exhibit context-sensitive rather than fixed personality expression, adapting flexibly to social interaction goals and affective conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Knowledge Purification in Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation for LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01064</link><description>arXiv:2602.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation has emerged as a pivotal technique for transferring knowledge from stronger large language models (LLMs) to smaller, more efficient models. However, traditional distillation approaches face challenges related to knowledge conflicts and high resource demands, particularly when leveraging multiple teacher models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textbf{Knowledge Purification}, which consolidates the rationales from multiple teacher LLMs into a single rationale, thereby mitigating conflicts and enhancing efficiency. To investigate the effectiveness of knowledge purification, we further propose five purification methods from various perspectives. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods not only improve the performance of the distilled model but also effectively alleviate knowledge conflicts. Moreover, router-based methods exhibit robust generalization capabilities, underscoring the potential of innovative purification techniques in optimizing multi-teacher distillation and facilitating the practical deployment of powerful yet lightweight models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simple and Robust Quality Disclosure: The Power of Quantile Partition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01066</link><description>arXiv:2602.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality information on online platforms is often conveyed through simple, percentile-based badges and tiers that remain stable across different market environments. Motivated by this empirical evidence, we study robust quality disclosure in a market where a platform commits to a public disclosure policy mapping the seller's product quality into a signal, and the seller subsequently sets a downstream monopoly price. Buyers have heterogeneous private types and valuations that are linear in quality. We evaluate a disclosure policy via a minimax competitive ratio: its worst-case revenue relative to the Bayesian-optimal disclosure-and-pricing benchmark, uniformly over all prior quality distributions, type distributions, and admissible valuations.
  Our main results provide a sharp theoretical justification for quantile-partition disclosure. For K-quantile partition policies, we fully characterize the robust optimum: the optimal worst-case ratio is pinned down by a one-dimensional fixed-point equation and the optimal thresholds follow a backward recursion. We also give an explicit formula for the robust ratio of any quantile partition as a simple "max-over-bins" expression, which explains why the robust-optimal partition allocates finer resolution to upper quantiles and yields tight guarantees such as 1 + 1/K for uniform percentile buckets. In contrast, we show a robustness limit for finite-signal monotone (quality-threshold) partitions, which cannot beat a factor-2 approximation. Technically, our analysis reduces the robust quality disclosure to a robust disclosure design program by establishing a tight functional characterization of all feasible indirect revenue functions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01066v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Systematic Study of Data Modalities and Strategies for Co-training Large Behavior Models for Robot Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01067</link><description>arXiv:2602.01067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large behavior models have shown strong dexterous manipulation capabilities by extending imitation learning to large-scale training on multi-task robot data, yet their generalization remains limited by the insufficient robot data coverage. To expand this coverage without costly additional data collection, recent work relies on co-training: jointly learning from target robot data and heterogeneous data modalities. However, how different co-training data modalities and strategies affect policy performance remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale empirical study examining five co-training data modalities: standard vision-language data, dense language annotations for robot trajectories, cross-embodiment robot data, human videos, and discrete robot action tokens across single- and multi-phase training strategies. Our study leverages 4,000 hours of robot and human manipulation data and 50M vision-language samples to train vision-language-action policies. We evaluate 89 policies over 58,000 simulation rollouts and 2,835 real-world rollouts. Our results show that co-training with forms of vision-language and cross-embodiment robot data substantially improves generalization to distribution shifts, unseen tasks, and language following, while discrete action token variants yield no significant benefits. Combining effective modalities produces cumulative gains and enables rapid adaptation to unseen long-horizon dexterous tasks via fine-tuning. Training exclusively on robot data degrades the visiolinguistic understanding of the vision-language model backbone, while co-training with effective modalities restores these capabilities. Explicitly conditioning action generation on chain-of-thought traces learned from co-training data does not improve performance in our simulation benchmark. Together, these results provide practical guidance for building scalable generalist robot policies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Utterance to Vividity: Training Expressive Subtitle Translation LLM via Adaptive Local Preference Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01068</link><description>arXiv:2602.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the general capabilities of machine translation. However, as application scenarios become more complex, the limitations of LLMs in vertical domain translations are gradually becoming apparent. In this study, we focus on how to construct translation LLMs that meet the needs of domain customization. We take visual media subtitle translation as our topic and explore how to train expressive and vivid translation LLMs. We investigated the situations of subtitle translation and other domains of literal and liberal translation, verifying the reliability of LLM as reward model and evaluator for translation. Additionally, to train an expressive translation LLM, we constructed and released a multidirectional subtitle parallel corpus dataset and proposed the Adaptive Local Preference Optimization (ALPO) method to address fine-grained preference alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that ALPO achieves outstanding performance in multidimensional evaluation of translation quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PDE-Constrained Optimization for Neural Image Segmentation with Physics Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01069</link><description>arXiv:2602.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of microscopy images constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem due to measurement noise, weak object boundaries, and limited labeled data. Although deep neural networks provide flexible nonparametric estimators, unconstrained empirical risk minimization often leads to unstable solutions and poor generalization. In this work, image segmentation is formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem that integrates physically motivated priors into deep learning models through variational regularization. The proposed framework minimizes a composite objective function consisting of a data fidelity term and penalty terms derived from reaction-diffusion equations and phase-field interface energies, all implemented as differentiable residual losses. Experiments are conducted on the LIVECell dataset, a high-quality, manually annotated collection of phase-contrast microscopy images. Training is performed on two cell types, while evaluation is carried out on a distinct, unseen cell type to assess generalization. A UNet architecture is used as the unconstrained baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy and boundary fidelity compared to unconstrained deep learning baselines. Moreover, the PDE-regularized models exhibit enhanced stability and improved generalization in low-sample regimes, highlighting the advantages of incorporating structured priors. The proposed approach illustrates how PDE-constrained optimization can strengthen data-driven learning frameworks, providing a principled bridge between variational methods, statistical learning, and scientific machine learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01069v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What If We Allocate Test-Time Compute Adaptively?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01070</link><description>arXiv:2602.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time compute scaling allocates inference computation uniformly, uses fixed sampling strategies, and applies verification only for reranking. In contrast, we propose a verifier-guided adaptive framework treating reasoning as iterative trajectory generation and selection. For each problem, the agent runs multiple inference iterations. In each iteration, it optionally produces a high-level plan, selects a set of reasoning tools and a compute strategy together with an exploration parameter, and then generates a candidate reasoning trajectory. A process reward model (PRM) serves as a unified control signal: within each iteration, step-level PRM scores are aggregated to guide pruning and expansion during generation, and across iterations, aggregated trajectory rewards are used to select the final response. Across datasets, our dynamic, PRM-guided approach consistently outperforms direct test-time scaling, yielding large gains on MATH-500 and several-fold improvements on harder benchmarks such as AIME24 and AMO-Bench. We characterize efficiency using theoretical FLOPs and a compute intensity metric penalizing wasted generation and tool overhead, demonstrating that verification-guided allocation concentrates computation on high-utility reasoning paths.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01070v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Counting Unit Circular Arc Intersections</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01074</link><description>arXiv:2602.01074v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Convex analysis is a modern branch of mathematics with many applications. As Large Language Models (LLMs) start to automate research-level math and sciences, it is important for LLMs to demonstrate the ability to understand and reason with convexity. We introduce \cb, a scalable and mechanically verifiable benchmark for testing \textit{whether LLMs can identify the convexity of a symbolic objective under deep functional composition.} Experiments on frontier LLMs reveal a sharp compositional reasoning gap: performance degrades rapidly with increasing depth, dropping from an F1-score of $1.0$ at depth $2$ to approximately $0.2$ at depth $100$. Inspection of models' reasoning traces indicates two failure modes: \textit{parsing failure} and \textit{lazy reasoning}. To address these limitations, we propose an agentic divide-and-conquer framework that (i) offloads parsing to an external tool to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) and (ii) enforces recursive reasoning over each intermediate sub-expression with focused context. This framework reliably mitigates deep-composition failures, achieving substantial performance improvement at large depths (e.g., F1-Score $= 1.0$ at depth $100$).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01075v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PISA: Piecewise Sparse Attention Is Wiser for Efficient Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01077</link><description>arXiv:2602.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers are fundamental for video and image generation, but their efficiency is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of attention. While block sparse attention accelerates computation by attending only critical key-value blocks, it suffers from degradation at high sparsity by discarding context. In this work, we discover that attention scores of non-critical blocks exhibit distributional stability, allowing them to be approximated accurately and efficiently rather than discarded, which is essentially important for sparse attention design. Motivated by this key insight, we propose PISA, a training-free Piecewise Sparse Attention that covers the full attention span with sub-quadratic complexity. Unlike the conventional keep-or-drop paradigm that directly drop the non-critical block information, PISA introduces a novel exact-or-approximate strategy: it maintains exact computation for critical blocks while efficiently approximating the remainder through block-wise Taylor expansion. This design allows PISA to serve as a faithful proxy to full attention, effectively bridging the gap between speed and quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PISA achieves 1.91 times and 2.57 times speedups on Wan2.1-14B and Hunyuan-Video, respectively, while consistently maintaining the highest quality among sparse attention methods. Notably, even for image generation on FLUX, PISA achieves a 1.2 times acceleration without compromising visual quality.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong potential for autonomous machine learning, yet their applicability to health data remains limited.

Beyond producing ready-to-use models, the system generates comprehensive reports to support trustworthy interpretation and risk-aware decision-making. To rigorously evaluate its effectiveness, we curate a challenging real-world benchmark comprising 17 tasks across diverse data modalities and learning settings. \textit{AutoHealth} completes all tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 29.2\% in prediction performance and 50.2\% in uncertainty estimation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01078v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedAD-R1: Eliciting Consistent Reasoning in Interpretible Medical Anomaly Detection via Consistency-Reinforced Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01081</link><description>arXiv:2602.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Anomaly Detection (MedAD) presents a significant opportunity to enhance diagnostic accuracy using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to interpret and answer questions based on medical images. However, the reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on simplistic and fragmented datasets has hindered the development of models capable of plausible reasoning and robust multimodal generalization. To overcome this, we introduce MedAD-38K, the first large-scale, multi-modal, and multi-center benchmark for MedAD featuring diagnostic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations alongside structured Visual Question-Answering (VQA) pairs. On this foundation, we propose a two-stage training framework. The first stage, Cognitive Injection, uses SFT to instill foundational medical knowledge and align the model with a structured think-then-answer paradigm. Given that standard policy optimization can produce reasoning that is disconnected from the final answer, the second stage incorporates Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (Con-GRPO). This novel algorithm incorporates a crucial consistency reward to ensure the generated reasoning process is relevant and logically coherent with the final diagnosis. Our proposed model, MedAD-R1, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MedAD-38K benchmark, outperforming strong baselines by more than 10\%. This superior performance stems from its ability to generate transparent and logically consistent reasoning pathways, offering a promising approach to enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI for clinical decision support.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01081v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EvoOpt-LLM: Evolving industrial optimization models with large language models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01082</link><description>arXiv:2602.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization modeling via mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is fundamental to industrial planning and scheduling, yet translating natural-language requirements into solver-executable models and maintaining them under evolving business rules remains highly expertise-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for automation, existing methods often suffer from low data efficiency, limited solver-level validity, and poor scalability to industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, we present EvoOpt-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework supporting the full lifecycle of industrial optimization modeling, including automated model construction, dynamic business-constraint injection, and end-to-end variable pruning. Built on a 7B-parameter LLM and adapted via parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning, EvoOpt-LLM achieves a generation rate of 91% and an executability rate of 65.9% with only 3,000 training samples, with critical performance gains emerging under 1,500 samples. The constraint injection module reliably augments existing MILP models while preserving original objectives, and the variable pruning module enhances computational efficiency, achieving an F1 score of ~0.56 on medium-sized LP models with only 400 samples. EvoOpt-LLM demonstrates a practical, data-efficient approach to industrial optimization modeling, reducing reliance on expert intervention while improving adaptability and solver efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01082v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Expressive Power of Permutation-Equivariant Weight-Space Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01083</link><description>arXiv:2602.01083v1 Announce Type: new

SOTA weight-space networks rely on permutation-equivariant designs to improve generalization. However, this may negatively affect expressive power, warranting theoretical investigation. Importantly, unlike other structured domains, weight-space learning targets maps operating on both weight and function spaces, making expressivity analysis particularly subtle. While a few prior works provide partial expressivity results, a comprehensive characterization is still missing. In this work, we address this gap by developing a systematic theory for expressivity of weight-space networks. We first prove that all prominent permutation-equivariant networks are equivalent in expressive power. We then establish universality in both weight- and function-space settings under mild, natural assumptions on the input weights, and characterize the edge-case regimes where universality no longer holds. Together, these results provide a strong and unified foundation for the expressivity of weight-space networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01083v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Estimating Force Interactions of Deformable Linear Objects from their Shapes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01085</link><description>arXiv:2602.01085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an analytical approach for detecting and estimating external forces acting on deformable linear objects (DLOs) using only their observed shapes. In many robot-wire interaction tasks, contact occurs not at the end-effector but at other points along the robot's body. Such scenarios arise when robots manipulate wires indirectly (e.g., by nudging) or when wires act as passive obstacles in the environment. Accurately identifying these interactions is crucial for safe and efficient trajectory planning, helping to prevent wire damage, avoid restricted robot motions, and mitigate potential hazards. Existing approaches often rely on expensive external force-torque sensor or that contacts occur at the end-effector for accurate force estimation. Using wire shape information acquired from a depth camera and under the assumption that the wire is in or near its static equilibrium, our method estimates both the location and magnitude of external forces without additional prior knowledge. This is achieved by exploiting derived consistency conditions and solving a system of linear equations based on force-torque balance along the wire. The approach was validated through simulation, where it achieved high accuracy, and through real-world experiments, where accurate estimation was demonstrated in selected interaction scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedBeads: An Agent-Native, Immutable Data Substrate for Trustworthy Medical AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01086</link><description>arXiv:2602.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: As of 2026, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate expert-level medical knowledge. However, deploying them as autonomous "Clinical Agents" remains limited. Current Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and standards like FHIR are designed for human review, creating a "Context Mismatch": AI agents receive fragmented data and must rely on probabilistic inference (e.g., RAG) to reconstruct patient history. This approach causes hallucinations and hinders auditability. Methods: We propose MedBeads, an agent-native data infrastructure where clinical events are immutable "Beads"--nodes in a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)--cryptographically referencing causal predecessors. This "write-once, read-many" architecture makes tampering mathematically detectable. We implemented a prototype with a Go Core Engine, Python middleware for LLM integration, and a React-based visualization interface. Results: We successfully implemented the workflow using synthetic data. The FHIR-to-DAG conversion transformed flat resources into a causally-linked graph. Our Breadth-First Search (BFS) Context Retrieval algorithm traverses relevant subgraphs with O(V+E) complexity, enabling real-time decision support. Tamper-evidence is guaranteed by design: any modification breaks the cryptographic chain. The visualization aids clinician understanding through explicit causal links. Conclusion: MedBeads addresses the "Context Mismatch" by shifting from probabilistic search to deterministic graph traversal, and from mutable records to immutable chains, providing the substrate for "Trustworthy Medical AI." It guarantees the context the AI receives is deterministic and tamper-evident, while the LLM determines interpretation. The structured Bead format serves as a token-efficient "AI-native language." We release MedBeads as open-source software to accelerate agent-native data standards.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differential Vector Erasure: Unified Training-Free Concept Erasure for Flow Matching Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01089</link><description>arXiv:2602.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images, yet their tendency to reproduce undesirable concepts, such as NSFW content, copyrighted styles, or specific objects, poses growing concerns for safe and controllable deployment. While existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on DDPM-based diffusion models and rely on costly fine-tuning, the recent emergence of flow matching models introduces a fundamentally different generative paradigm for which prior methods are not directly applicable. In this paper, we propose Differential Vector Erasure (DVE), a training-free concept erasure method specifically designed for flow matching models. Our key insight is that semantic concepts are implicitly encoded in the directional structure of the velocity field governing the generative flow. Leveraging this observation, we construct a differential vector field that characterizes the directional discrepancy between a target concept and a carefully chosen anchor concept. During inference, DVE selectively removes concept-specific components by projecting the velocity field onto the differential direction, enabling precise concept suppression without affecting irrelevant semantics. Extensive experiments on FLUX demonstrate that DVE consistently outperforms existing baselines on a wide range of concept erasure tasks, including NSFW suppression, artistic style removal, and object erasure, while preserving image quality and diversity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hard Constraints Meet Soft Generation: Guaranteed Feasibility for LLM-based Combinatorial Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01090</link><description>arXiv:2602.01090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising general-purpose solvers for combinatorial optimization (CO), yet they fundamentally lack mechanisms to guarantee solution feasibility which is critical for real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce FALCON, a framework that ensures 100\% feasibility through three key innovations: (i) \emph{grammar-constrained decoding} enforces syntactic validity, (ii) a \emph{feasibility repair layer} corrects semantic constraint violations, and (iii) \emph{adaptive Best-of-$N$ sampling} allocates inference compute efficiently. To train the underlying LLM, we introduce the Best-anchored Objective-guided Preference Optimization (BOPO) in LLM training, which weights preference pairs by their objective gap, providing dense supervision without human labels. Theoretically, we prove convergence for BOPO and provide bounds on repair-induced quality loss. Empirically, across seven NP-hard CO problems, FALCON achieves perfect feasibility while matching or exceeding the solution quality of state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based solvers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01090v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Failure-Aware Bimanual Teleoperation via Conservative Value Guided Assistance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01092</link><description>arXiv:2602.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperation of high-precision manipulation is con-strained by tight success tolerances and complex contact dy-namics, which make impending failures difficult for human operators to anticipate under partial observability. This paper proposes a value-guided, failure-aware framework for bimanual teleoperation that provides compliant haptic assistance while pre-serving continuous human authority. The framework is trained entirely from heterogeneous offline teleoperation data containing both successful and failed executions. Task feasibility is mod-eled as a conservative success score learned via Conservative Value Learning, yielding a risk-sensitive estimate that remains reliable under distribution shift. During online operation, the learned success score regulates the level of assistance, while a learned actor provides a corrective motion direction. Both are integrated through a joint-space impedance interface on the master side, yielding continuous guidance that steers the operator away from failure-prone actions without overriding intent. Experimental results on contact-rich manipulation tasks demonstrate improved task success rates and reduced operator workload compared to conventional teleoperation and shared-autonomy baselines, indicating that conservative value learning provides an effective mechanism for embedding failure awareness into bilateral teleoperation.

Abstract: Motivated by the design of deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) microfluidic devices, we develop a high-order numerical framework for fluid-rigid-body interaction on fitted moving meshes. Rigid-body motion is enforced by a distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM) formulation, while the moving fluid domain is treated by an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) mapping. In space, we use isoparametric Taylor-Hood elements to achieve high-order accuracy and to represent curved boundaries and the fluid-particle interface. In time, we employ a high-order partitioned Runge-Kutta strategy in which the mesh motion is advanced explicitly and the coupled physical fields are advanced implicitly, yielding high-order accuracy for the particle trajectory. The fully coupled system is linearized into a generalized Stokes problem subject to distributed constraints of incompressibility and rigid-body motion. We establish well-posedness of this generalized Stokes formulation at both the continuous and discrete levels, providing the stability foundation for operator preconditioning that is robust with respect to key physical and discretization parameters. Numerical experiments on representative benchmarks, including a DLD case, demonstrate high-order convergence for the fluid solution and rigid-body dynamics, as well as robust iterative convergence of the proposed preconditioners.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01094v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PandaPose: 3D Human Pose Lifting from a Single Image via Propagating 2D Pose Prior to 3D Anchor Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01095</link><description>arXiv:2602.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D human pose lifting from a single RGB image is a challenging task in 3D vision. Existing methods typically establish a direct joint-to-joint mapping from 2D to 3D poses based on 2D features. This formulation suffers from two fundamental limitations: inevitable error propagation from input predicted 2D pose to 3D predictions and inherent difficulties in handling self-occlusion cases. In this paper, we propose PandaPose, a 3D human pose lifting approach via propagating 2D pose prior to 3D anchor space as the unified intermediate representation. Specifically, our 3D anchor space comprises: (1) Joint-wise 3D anchors in the canonical coordinate system, providing accurate and robust priors to mitigate 2D pose estimation inaccuracies. (2) Depth-aware joint-wise feature lifting that hierarchically integrates depth information to resolve self-occlusion ambiguities. (3) The anchor-feature interaction decoder that incorporates 3D anchors with lifted features to generate unified anchor queries encapsulating joint-wise 3D anchor set, visual cues and geometric depth information. The anchor queries are further employed to facilitate anchor-to-joint ensemble prediction. Experiments on three well-established benchmarks (i.e., Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW) demonstrate the superiority of our proposition. The substantial reduction in error by $14.7\%$ compared to SOTA methods on the challenging conditions of Human3.6M and qualitative comparisons further showcase the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01095v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StreamVLA: Breaking the Reason-Act Cycle via Completion-State Gating</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01100</link><description>arXiv:2602.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation requires bridging the gap between high-level planning (System 2) and low-level control (System 1). Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often entangle these processes, performing redundant multimodal reasoning at every timestep, which leads to high latency and goal instability. To address this, we present StreamVLA, a dual-system architecture that unifies textual task decomposition, visual goal imagination, and continuous action generation within a single parameter-efficient backbone. We introduce a "Lock-and-Gated" mechanism to intelligently modulate computation: only when a sub-task transition is detected, the model triggers slow thinking to generate a textual instruction and imagines the specific visual completion state, rather than generic future frames. Crucially, this completion state serves as a time-invariant goal anchor, making the policy robust to execution speed variations. During steady execution, these high-level intents are locked to condition a Flow Matching action head, allowing the model to bypass expensive autoregressive decoding for 72% of timesteps. This hierarchical abstraction ensures sub-goal focus while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that StreamVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 98.5% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark and robust recovery in real-world interference scenarios, achieving a 48% reduction in latency compared to full-reasoning baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01100v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Harmful Meme Detection under Missing Modalities via Shared Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01101</link><description>arXiv:2602.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet memes are powerful tools for communication, capable of spreading political, psychological, and sociocultural ideas. However, they can be harmful and can be used to disseminate hate toward targeted individuals or groups. Although previous studies have focused on designing new detection methods, these often rely on modal-complete data, such as text and images. In real-world settings, however, modalities like text may be missing due to issues like poor OCR quality, making existing methods sensitive to missing information and leading to performance deterioration. To address this gap, in this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work to comprehensively investigate the behavior of harmful meme detection methods in the presence of modal-incomplete data. Specifically, we propose a new baseline method that learns a shared representation for multiple modalities by projecting them independently. These shared representations can then be leveraged when data is modal-incomplete. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches when text is missing. Moreover, these results suggest that our method allows for better integration of visual features, reducing dependence on text and improving robustness in scenarios where textual information is missing. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of harmful meme detection, particularly in situations where a modality is absent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01101v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Resilience Optimization in 6G and Beyond Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01102</link><description>arXiv:2602.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring network resilience in 6G and beyond is essential to maintain service continuity during base station (BS) outages due to failures, disasters, attacks, or energy-saving operations. This paper proposes a novel resilience optimization framework for integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs), leveraging low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to assist users when terrestrial BSs are unavailable. Specifically, we develop a realistic multi-cell model incorporating user association, antenna downtilt adaptation, power control, heterogeneous traffic demands, and dynamic user distribution. The objective is to maximize of the total user rate in the considered area by optimizing the BS's antenna tilt, transmission power, user association to neighboring BS or to a LEO satellite with a minimum number of successfully served user satisfaction constraint, defined by rate and Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) requirements. To solve the non-convex, NP-hard problem, we design a deep Q-network (DQN)-based algorithm to learn network dynamics to maximize throughput while minimizing LEO satellite usage, thereby limiting reliance on links with longer propagation delays and prolonging satellite operational lifetime. Simulation results confirm that our approach significantly outperforms the benchmark one.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01102v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probing RLVR training instability through the lens of objective-level hacking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01103</link><description>arXiv:2602.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prolonged reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to drive continuous improvements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, but the training is often prone to instabilities, especially in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Training instability severely undermines model capability improvement, yet its underlying causes and mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a principled framework for understanding RLVR instability through the lens of objective-level hacking. Unlike reward hacking, which arises from exploitable verifiers, objective-level hacking emerges from token-level credit misalignment and is manifested as system-level spurious signals in the optimization objective. Grounded in our framework, together with extensive experiments on a 30B MoE model, we trace the origin and formalize the mechanism behind a key pathological training dynamic in MoE models: the abnormal growth of the training-inference discrepancy, a phenomenon widely associated with instability but previously lacking a mechanistic explanation. These findings provide a concrete and causal account of the training dynamics underlying instabilities in MoE models, offering guidance for the design of stable RLVR algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast $k$-means Seeding Under The Manifold Hypothesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01104</link><description>arXiv:2602.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study beyond worst case analysis for the $k$-means problem where the goal is to model typical instances of $k$-means arising in practice. Existing theoretical approaches provide guarantees under certain assumptions on the optimal solutions to $k$-means, making them difficult to validate in practice. We propose the manifold hypothesis, where data obtained in ambient dimension $D$ concentrates around a low dimensional manifold of intrinsic dimension $d$, as a reasonable assumption to model real world clustering instances. We identify key geometric properties of datasets which have theoretically predictable scaling laws depending on the quantization exponent $\varepsilon = 2/d$ using techniques from optimum quantization theory. We show how to exploit these regularities to design a fast seeding method called $\operatorname{Qkmeans}$ which provides $O(\rho^{-2} \log k)$ approximate solutions to the $k$-means problem in time $O(nD) + \widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{1+\rho}\rho^{-1}k^{1+\gamma})$; where the exponent $\gamma = \varepsilon + \rho$ for an input parameter $\rho &lt; 1$. This allows us to obtain new runtime - quality tradeoffs. We perform a large scale empirical study across various domains to validate our theoretical predictions and algorithm performance to bridge theory and practice for beyond worst case data clustering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01104v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OLion: Approaching the Hadamard Ideal by Intersecting Spectral and $\ell_{\infty}$ Implicit Biases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01105</link><description>arXiv:2602.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many optimizers can be interpreted as steepest-descent methods under norm-induced geometries, and thus inherit corresponding implicit biases. We introduce \nameA{} (\fullname{}), which combines spectral control from orthogonalized update directions with $\ell_\infty$-style coordinate control from sign updates. \nameA{} forms a Lion-style momentum direction, approximately orthogonalizes it via a few Newton--Schulz iterations, and then applies an entrywise sign, providing an efficient approximation to taking a maximal step over the intersection of the spectral and $\ell_\infty$ constraint sets (a scaled Hadamard-like set for matrix parameters). Despite the strong nonlinearity of orthogonalization and sign, we prove convergence under a mild, empirically verified diagonal-isotropy assumption. Across large-scale language and vision training, including GPT-2 and Llama pretraining, SiT image pretraining, and supervised fine-tuning, \nameA{} matches or outperforms AdamW and Muon under comparable tuning while using only momentum-level optimizer state, and it mitigates optimizer mismatch when fine-tuning AdamW-pretrained checkpoints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01105v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPELL: Synthesis of Programmatic Edits using LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01107</link><description>arXiv:2602.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Library migration is a common but error-prone task in software development. Developers may need to replace one library with another due to reasons like changing requirements or licensing changes. Migration typically entails updating and rewriting source code manually. While automated migration tools exist, most rely on mining examples from real-world projects that have already undergone similar migrations. However, these data are scarce, and collecting them for arbitrary pairs of libraries is difficult. Moreover, these migration tools often miss out on leveraging modern code transformation infrastructure.
  In this paper, we present a new approach to automated API migration that sidesteps the limitations described above. Instead of relying on existing migration data or using LLMs directly for transformation, we use LLMs to extract migration examples. Next, we use an Agent to generalize those examples to reusable transformation scripts in PolyglotPiranha, a modern code transformation tool. Our method distills latent migration knowledge from LLMs into structured, testable, and repeatable migration logic, without requiring preexisting corpora or manual engineering effort. Experimental results across Python libraries show that our system can generate diverse migration examples and synthesize transformation scripts that generalize to real-world codebases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01107v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transforming Vehicle Diagnostics: A Multimodal Approach to Error Patterns Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01109</link><description>arXiv:2602.01109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately diagnosing and predicting vehicle malfunctions is crucial for maintenance and safety in the automotive industry. While modern diagnostic systems primarily rely on sequences of vehicular Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) registered in On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) systems, they often overlook valuable contextual information such as raw sensory data (e.g., temperature, humidity, and pressure). This contextual data, crucial for domain experts to classify vehicle failures, introduces unique challenges due to its complexity and the noisy nature of real-world data. This paper presents BiCarFormer: the first multimodal approach to multi-label sequence classification of error codes into error patterns that integrates DTC sequences and environmental conditions. BiCarFormer is a bidirectional Transformer model tailored for vehicle event sequences, employing embedding fusions and a co-attention mechanism to capture the relationships between diagnostic codes and environmental data. Experimental results on a challenging real-world automotive dataset with 22,137 error codes and 360 error patterns demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to models that rely solely on DTC sequences and traditional sequence models. This work highlights the importance of incorporating contextual environmental information for more accurate and robust vehicle diagnostics, hence reducing maintenance costs and enhancing automation processes in the automotive industry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Single-Edge Node Injection Threats to GNN-Based Security Monitoring in Industrial Graph Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01113</link><description>arXiv:2602.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly adopted in industrial graph-based monitoring systems (e.g., Industrial internet of things (IIoT) device graphs, power-grid topology models, and manufacturing communication networks) to support anomaly detection, state estimation, and asset classification. In such settings, an adversary that compromises a small number of edge devices may inject counterfeit nodes (e.g., rogue sensors, virtualized endpoints, or spoofed substations) to bias downstream decisions while evading topology- and homophily-based sanitization. This paper formulates deployment-oriented node-injection attacks under constrained resources and proposes the \emph{Single-Edge Graph Injection Attack} (SEGIA), in which each injected node attaches to the operational graph through a single edge. SEGIA integrates a pruned SGC surrogate, multi-hop neighborhood sampling, and reverse graph convolution-based feature synthesis with a similarity-regularized objective to preserve local homophily and survive edge pruning. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations across datasets and defenses show at least $25\%$ higher attack success than representative baselines under substantially smaller edge budgets. These results indicate a system-level risk in industrial GNN deployments and motivate lightweight admission validation and neighborhood-consistency monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01113v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bowling with ChatGPT: On the Evolving User Interactions with Conversational AI Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01114</link><description>arXiv:2602.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have discussed how users are increasingly using conversational AI systems, powered by LLMs, for information seeking, decision support, and even emotional support. However, these macro-level observations offer limited insight into how the purpose of these interactions shifts over time, how users frame their interactions with the system, and how steering dynamics unfold in these human-AI interactions. To examine these evolving dynamics, we gathered and analyzed a unique dataset InVivoGPT: consisting of 825K ChatGPT interactions, donated by 300 users through their GDPR data rights. Our analyses reveal three key findings. First, participants increasingly turn to ChatGPT for a broader range of purposes, including substantial growth in sensitive domains such as health and mental health. Second, interactions become more socially framed: the system anthropomorphizes itself at rising rates, participants more frequently treat it as a companion, and personal data disclosure becomes both more common and more diverse. Third, conversational steering becomes more prominent, especially after the release of GPT-4o, with conversations where the participants followed a model-initiated suggestion quadrupling over the period of our dataset. Overall, our results show that conversational AI systems are shifting from functional tools to social partners, raising important questions about their design and governance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KAN We Flow?

Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies excel at modeling action distributions but are inference-inefficient, since recursively denoising from noise to policy requires many steps and heavy UNet backbones, which hinders deployment on resource-constrained robots. Flow matching alleviates the sampling burden by learning a one-step vector field, yet prior implementations still inherit large UNet-style architectures. In this work, we present KAN-We-Flow, a flow-matching policy that draws on recent advances in Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) from vision to build a lightweight and highly expressive backbone for 3D manipulation. Concretely, we introduce an RWKV-KAN block: an RWKV first performs efficient time/channel mixing to propagate task context, and a subsequent GroupKAN layer applies learnable spline-based, groupwise functional mappings to perform feature-wise nonlinear calibration of the action mapping on RWKV outputs. Moreover, we introduce an Action Consistency Regularization (ACR), a lightweight auxiliary loss that enforces alignment between predicted action trajectories and expert demonstrations via Euler extrapolation, providing additional supervision to stabilize training and improve policy precision. Without resorting to large UNets, our design reduces parameters by 86.8\%, maintains fast runtime, and achieves state-of-the-art success rates on Adroit, Meta-World, and DexArt benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle in knowledge-intensive tasks, as retrievers often overfit to surface similarity and fail on queries involving complex logical relations. The capacity for logical analysis is inherent in model representations but remains underutilized in standard training. LORE (Logic ORiented Retriever Enhancement) introduces fine-grained contrastive learning to activate this latent capacity, guiding embeddings toward evidence aligned with logical structure rather than shallow similarity. LORE requires no external upervision, resources, or pre-retrieval analysis, remains index-compatible, and consistently improves retrieval utility and downstream generation while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Inverse rendering in urban scenes is pivotal for applications like autonomous driving and digital twins. Yet, it faces significant challenges due to complex illumination conditions, including multi-illumination and indirect light and shadow effects. However, the effects of these challenges on intrinsic decomposition and 3D reconstruction have not been explored due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we present LightCity, a novel high-quality synthetic urban dataset featuring diverse illumination conditions with realistic indirect light and shadow effects. LightCity encompasses over 300 sky maps with highly controllable illumination, varying scales with street-level and aerial perspectives over 50K images, and rich properties such as depth, normal, material components, light and indirect light, etc. Besides, we leverage LightCity to benchmark three fundamental tasks in the urban environments and conduct a comprehensive analysis of these benchmarks, laying a robust foundation for advancing related research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01118v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tendem: A Hybrid AI+Human Platform</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01119</link><description>arXiv:2602.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tendem is a hybrid system where AI handles structured, repeatable work and Human Experts step in when the models fail or to verify results. Each result undergoes a comprehensive quality review before delivery to the Client. To assess Tendem's performance, we conducted a series of in-house evaluations on 94 real-world tasks, comparing it with AI-only agents and human-only workflows carried out by Upwork freelancers. The results show that Tendem consistently delivers higher-quality outputs with faster turnaround times. At the same time, its operational costs remain comparable to human-only execution. On third-party agentic benchmarks, Tendem's AI Agent (operating autonomously, without human involvement) performs near state-of-the-art on web browsing and tool-use tasks while demonstrating strong results in frontier domain knowledge and reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01119v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MarkovScale: Towards Optimal Sequential Scaling at Inference Time</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01120</link><description>arXiv:2602.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential scaling is a prominent inference-time scaling paradigm, yet its performance improvements are typically modest and not well understood, largely due to the prevalence of heuristic, non-principled approaches that obscure clear optimality bounds. To address this, we propose a principled framework that models sequential scaling as a two-state Markov process. This approach reveals the underlying properties of sequential scaling and yields closed-form solutions for essential aspects, such as the specific conditions under which accuracy is improved and the theoretical upper, neutral, and lower performance bounds. Leveraging this formulation, we develop MarkovScale, a practical system that applies these optimality criteria to achieve a theoretically grounded balance between accuracy and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across 3 backbone LLMs, 5 benchmarks, and over 20 configurations show that MarkovScale consistently outperforms state-of-the-art parallel and sequential scaling methods, representing a significant step toward optimal and resource-efficient inference in LLMs. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01120v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ChronoSpike: An Adaptive Spiking Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01124</link><description>arXiv:2602.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning requires capturing both structural relationships and temporal evolution, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: attention-based methods achieve expressiveness at $O(T^2)$ complexity, while recurrent architectures suffer from gradient pathologies and dense state storage. Spiking neural networks offer event-driven efficiency but remain limited by sequential propagation, binary information loss, and local aggregation that misses global context. We propose ChronoSpike, an adaptive spiking graph neural network that integrates learnable LIF neurons with per-channel membrane dynamics, multi-head attentive spatial aggregation on continuous features, and a lightweight Transformer temporal encoder, enabling both fine-grained local modeling and long-range dependency capture with linear memory complexity $O(T \cdot d)$. On three large-scale benchmarks, ChronoSpike outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baselines by $2.0\%$ Macro-F1 and $2.4\%$ Micro-F1 while achieving $3-10\times$ faster training than recurrent methods with a constant 105K-parameter budget independent of graph size. We provide theoretical guarantees for membrane potential boundedness, gradient flow stability under contraction factor $\rho &lt; 1$, and BIBO stability; interpretability analyses reveal heterogeneous temporal receptive fields and a learned primacy effect with $83-88\%$ sparsity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Long-range Modeling and Processing of Multimodal Event Sequences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01125</link><description>arXiv:2602.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling asynchronous event sequences. While recent advances have extended TPPs to handle textual information, existing approaches are limited in their ability to generate rich, multimodal content and reason about event dynamics. A key challenge is that incorporating multimodal data dramatically increases sequence length, hindering the ability of attention-based models to generate coherent, long-form textual descriptions that require long-range understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that extends LLM-based TPPs to the visual modality, positioning text generation as a core capability alongside time and type prediction. Our approach addresses the long-context problem through an adaptive sequence compression mechanism based on temporal similarity, which reduces sequence length while preserving essential patterns. We employ a two-stage paradigm of pre-training on compressed sequences followed by supervised fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments, including on the challenging DanmakuTPP-QA benchmark, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and the quality of its generated textual analyses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01125v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WinFLoRA: Incentivizing Client-Adaptive Aggregation in Federated LoRA under Privacy Heterogeneity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01126</link><description>arXiv:2602.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly underpin intelligent web applications, from chatbots to search and recommendation, where efficient specialization is essential. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables such adaptation with minimal overhead, while federated LoRA allows web service providers to fine-tune shared models without data sharing. However, in privacy-sensitive deployments, clients inject varying levels of differential privacy (DP) noise, creating privacy heterogeneity that misaligns individual incentives and global performance. In this paper, we propose WinFLoRA, a privacy-heterogeneous federated LoRA that utilizes aggregation weights as incentives with noise awareness. Specifically, the noises from clients are estimated based on the uploaded LoRA adapters. A larger weight indicates greater influence on the global model and better downstream task performance, rewarding lower-noise contributions. By up-weighting low-noise updates, WinFLoRA improves global accuracy while accommodating clients' heterogeneous privacy requirements. Consequently, WinFLoRA aligns heterogeneous client utility in terms of privacy and downstream performance with global model objectives without third-party involvement. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that across multiple LLMs and datasets, WinFLoRA achieves up to 52.58% higher global accuracy and up to 2.56x client utility than state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual-language models such as CLIP provide powerful general-purpose representations, but their raw embeddings are not optimized for supervised classification, often exhibiting limited class separation and excessive dimensionality. We propose Koo-Fu CLIP, a supervised CLIP adaptation method based on Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis, which operates in a whitened embedding space to suppress within-class variation and enhance between-class discrimination. The resulting closed-form linear projection reshapes the geometry of CLIP embeddings, improving class separability while performing effective dimensionality reduction, and provides a lightweight and efficient adaptation of CLIP representations.
  Across large-scale ImageNet benchmarks, nearest visual prototype classification in the Koo-Fu CLIP space improves top-1 accuracy from 75.1% to 79.1% on ImageNet-1K, with consistent gains persisting as the label space expands to 14K and 21K classes. The method supports substantial compression by up to 10-12x with little or no loss in accuracy, enabling efficient large-scale classification and retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01127v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tangent Space Fine-Tuning for Directional Preference Alignment in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01128</link><description>arXiv:2602.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal is to enable large language models (LLMs) to balance multiple human preference dimensions; such as helpfulness, safety, and verbosity, through principled and controllable alignment. Existing preference optimization methods, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), collapse feedback into a single scalar reward, fixing one balance among objectives and preventing traversal of the Pareto front. Recent work by Ortiz-Jimenez et al. (2023) showed that fine-tuning can be viewed in a model's tangent space, where linearized updates act as additive vectors that can be composed to jointly perform well on multiple tasks. Building on this formulation, we extend this idea to preference alignment and propose Tangent-Space Direct Preference Optimization (TS-DPO), which performs DPO within this locally linear regime to learn per-objective update directions. These directions can be linearly combined at inference to generate user-specified behaviors without additional optimization. Evaluated on the helpfulness-verbosity trade-off using the HelpSteer and UltraFeedback datasets, TS-DPO achieves broader Pareto-optimal coverage and smoother preference control than scalarized DPO. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) further shows that tangent-space training amplifies canonical directions aligned with distinct preferences, improving disentanglement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01128v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SMCP: Secure Model Context Protocol</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01129</link><description>arXiv:2602.01129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems built around large language models (LLMs) are moving away from closed, single-model frameworks and toward open ecosystems that connect a variety of agents, external tools, and resources. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to unify tool access, allowing agents to discover, invoke, and coordinate with tools more flexibly. However, as MCP becomes more widely adopted, it also brings a new set of security and privacy challenges. These include risks such as unauthorized access, tool poisoning, prompt injection, privilege escalation, and supply chain attacks, any of which can impact different parts of the protocol workflow. While recent research has examined possible attack surfaces and suggested targeted countermeasures, there is still a lack of systematic, protocol-level security improvements for MCP. To address this, we introduce the Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP), which builds on MCP by adding unified identity management, robust mutual authentication, ongoing security context propagation, fine-grained policy enforcement, and comprehensive audit logging. In this paper, we present the main components of SMCP, explain how it helps reduce security risks, and illustrate its application with practical examples. We hope that this work will contribute to the development of agentic systems that are not only powerful and adaptable, but also secure and dependable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01129v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lyapunov Stability-Aware Stackelberg Game for Low-Altitude Economy: A Control-Oriented Pruning-Based DRL Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01131</link><description>arXiv:2602.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of the low-altitude economy, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) serve as pivotal aerial base stations supporting diverse services from users, ranging from latency-sensitive critical missions to bandwidth-intensive data streaming. However, the efficacy of such heterogeneous networks is often compromised by the conflict between limited onboard resources and stringent stability requirements. Moving beyond traditional throughput-centric designs, we propose a Sensing-Communication-Computing-Control closed-loop framework that explicitly models the impact of communication latency on physical control stability. To guarantee mission reliability, we leverage the Lyapunov stability theory to derive an intrinsic mapping between the state evolution of the control system and communication constraints, transforming abstract stability requirements into quantifiable resource boundaries. Then, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game, where UAVs (as leaders) dynamically price resources to balance load and ensure stability, while users (as followers) optimize requests based on service urgency. Furthermore, addressing the prohibitive computational overhead of standard Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on energy-constrained edge platforms, we propose a novel and lightweight pruning-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. By integrating a dynamic structured pruning mechanism, the proposed algorithm significantly compresses the neural network scale during training, enabling the UAV to rapidly approximate the game equilibrium with minimal inference latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively secures control loop stability while maximizing system utility in dynamic low-altitude environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Don't Judge a Book by its Cover: Testing LLMs' Robustness Under Logical Obfuscation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01132</link><description>arXiv:2602.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tasks such as solving arithmetic equations, evaluating truth tables, and completing syllogisms are handled well by large language models (LLMs) in their standard form, but they often fail when the same problems are posed in logically equivalent yet obfuscated formats. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Logifus, a structure-preserving logical obfuscation framework, and, utilizing this, we present LogiQAte, a first-of-its-kind diagnostic benchmark with 1,108 questions across four reasoning tasks: (i) Obfus FOL (first-order logic entailment under equivalence-preserving rewrites), (ii) Obfus Blood Relation (family-graph entailment under indirect relational chains), (iii) Obfus Number Series (pattern induction under symbolic substitutions), and (iv) Obfus Direction Sense (navigation reasoning under altered directions and reference frames). Across all the tasks, evaluating six state-of-the-art models, we find that obfuscation severely degrades zero-shot performance, with performance dropping on average by 47% for GPT-4o, 27% for GPT-5, and 22% for reasoning model, o4-mini. Our findings reveal that current LLMs parse questions without deep understanding, highlighting the urgency of building models that genuinely comprehend and preserve meaning beyond surface form.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parallel Training in Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01133</link><description>arXiv:2602.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bio-inspired integrate-fire-reset mechanism of spiking neurons constitutes the foundation for efficient processing in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Recent progress in large models demands that spiking neurons support highly parallel computation to scale efficiently on modern GPUs. This work proposes a novel functional perspective that provides general guidance for designing parallel spiking neurons. We argue that the reset mechanism, which induces complex temporal dependencies and hinders parallel training, should be removed. However, any such modification should satisfy two principles: 1) preserving the functions of reset as a core biological mechanism; and 2) enabling parallel training without sacrificing the serial inference ability of spiking neurons, which underpins their efficiency at test time. To this end, we identify the functions of the reset and analyze how to reconcile parallel training with serial inference, upon which we propose a dynamic decay spiking neuron. We conduct comprehensive testing of our method in terms of: 1) Training efficiency and extrapolation capability. On 16k-length sequences, we achieve a 25.6x training speedup over the pioneering parallel spiking neuron, and our models trained on 2k-length can stably perform inference on sequences as long as 30k. 2) Generality. We demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of the proposed method across five task categories (image classification, neuromorphic event processing, time-series forecasting, language modeling, and reinforcement learning), three network architectures (spiking CNN/Transformer/SSMs), and two spike activation modes (spike/integer activation). 3) Energy consumption. The spiking firing of our neuron is lower than that of vanilla and existing parallel spiking neurons.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The structure and enumeration of periodic binary sequences with high nonlinear complexity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01134</link><description>arXiv:2602.01134v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We study causal discovery from a single observed sequence of discrete events generated by a stochastic process, as encountered in vehicle logs, manufacturing systems, or patient trajectories. This regime is particularly challenging due to the absence of repeated samples, high dimensionality, and long-range temporal dependencies of the single observation during inference. We introduce TRACE, a scalable framework that repurposes autoregressive models as pretrained density estimators for conditional mutual information estimation. TRACE infers the summary causal graph between event types in a sequence, scaling linearly with the event vocabulary and supporting delayed causal effects, while being fully parallel on GPUs. We establish its theoretical identifiability under imperfect autoregressive models. Experiments demonstrate robust performance across different baselines and varying vocabulary sizes including an application to root-cause analysis in vehicle diagnostics with over 29,100 event types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Matrix-Spectral Framework for Stability and Interpretability in Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01136</link><description>arXiv:2602.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified matrix-spectral framework for analyzing stability and interpretability in deep neural networks. Representing networks as data-dependent products of linear operators reveals spectral quantities governing sensitivity to input perturbations, label noise, and training dynamics.
  We introduce a Global Matrix Stability Index that aggregates spectral information from Jacobians, parameter gradients, Neural Tangent Kernel operators, and loss Hessians into a single stability scale controlling forward sensitivity, attribution robustness, and optimization conditioning. We further show that spectral entropy refines classical operator-norm bounds by capturing typical, rather than purely worst-case, sensitivity.
  These quantities yield computable diagnostics and stability-oriented regularization principles. Synthetic experiments and controlled studies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 confirm that modest spectral regularization substantially improves attribution stability even when global spectral summaries change little.
  The results establish a precise connection between spectral concentration and analytic stability, providing practical guidance for robustness-aware model design and training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01136v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Generative Adversarial Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01137</link><description>arXiv:2602.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for alignment typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, both limited by the cost and scarcity of high-quality annotations. Recent self-play and synthetic data approaches reduce this dependence but often rely on heuristic assumptions or ungrounded self-evaluation, which can cause bias accumulation and performance drift. In this paper, we propose Self-Generative Adversarial LLM (SGALM), a unified fine-tuning framework that formulates alignment as a generative adversarial game within a single LLM. SGALM jointly evolves generation and discrimination capabilities without external reward models. Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that SGALM achieves state-of-the-art performance, serves as an effective alignment algorithm and a robust synthetic data engine.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01137v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Key Principles of Graph Machine Learning: Representation, Robustness, and Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01139</link><description>arXiv:2602.01139v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) underpins modern generative and representation models by turning continuous latents into discrete tokens. Yet hard nearest-neighbor assignments are non-differentiable and are typically optimized with heuristic straight-through estimators, which couple the update step size to the quantization gap and train each code in isolation, leading to unstable gradients and severe codebook under-utilization at scale. In this paper, we introduce GRIT-VQ (Generalized Radius and Integrated Transform-Vector Quantization), a unified surrogate framework that keeps hard assignments in the forward pass while making VQ fully differentiable. GRIT-VQ replaces the straight-through estimator with a radius-based update that moves latents along the quantization direction with a controllable, geometry-aware step, and applies a data-agnostic integrated transform to the codebook so that all codes are updated through shared parameters instead of independently. Our theoretical analysis clarifies the fundamental optimization dynamics introduced by GRIT-VQ, establishing conditions for stable gradient flow, coordinated codebook evolution, and reliable avoidance of collapse across a broad family of quantizers. Across image reconstruction, image generation, and recommendation tokenization benchmarks, GRIT-VQ consistently improves reconstruction error, generative quality, and recommendation accuracy while substantially increasing codebook utilization compared to existing VQ variants.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01140v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Surrogate to Poincar\'e inequalities on manifolds for structured dimension reduction in nonlinear feature spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01143</link><description>arXiv:2602.01143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the approximation of continuously differentiable functions with high-dimensional input by a composition of two functions: a feature map that extracts few features from the input space, and a profile function that approximates the target function taking the features as its low-dimensional input. We focus on the construction of structured nonlinear feature maps, that extract features on separate groups of variables, using a recently introduced gradient-based method that leverages Poincar\'e inequalities on nonlinear manifolds. This method consists in minimizing a non-convex loss functional, which can be a challenging task, especially for small training samples. We first investigate a collective setting, in which we construct a feature map suitable to a parametrized family of high-dimensional functions. In this setting we introduce a new quadratic surrogate to the non-convex loss function and show an upper bound on the latter. We then investigate a grouped setting, in which we construct separate feature maps for separate groups of inputs, and we show that this setting is almost equivalent to multiple collective settings, one for each group of variables.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01143v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PersistBench: When Should Long-Term Memories Be Forgotten by LLMs?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01146</link><description>arXiv:2602.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational assistants are increasingly integrating long-term memory with large language models (LLMs). This persistence of memories, e.g., the user is vegetarian, can enhance personalization in future conversations. However, the same persistence can also introduce safety risks that have been largely overlooked. Hence, we introduce PersistBench to measure the extent of these safety risks. We identify two long-term memory-specific risks: cross-domain leakage, where LLMs inappropriately inject context from the long-term memories; and memory-induced sycophancy, where stored long-term memories insidiously reinforce user biases. We evaluate 18 frontier and open-source LLMs on our benchmark. Our results reveal a surprisingly high failure rate across these LLMs - a median failure rate of 53% on cross-domain samples and 97% on sycophancy samples. To address this, our benchmark encourages the development of more robust and safer long-term memory usage in frontier conversational systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Capabilities and Fundamental Limits of Latent Chain-of-Thought</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01148</link><description>arXiv:2602.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Chain-of-Thought (Latent CoT) models promise efficient reasoning via continuous representations, yet exhibit puzzling performance inconsistencies: excelling at exploration (ProsQA: 97.0%) but failing at computation (GSM8K: 34.1%). We reveal that this trade-off is governed by decisional certainty. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We theoretically characterize the fundamental Exploration-Execution Trade-off, proving that high certainty enables precise execution but inhibits exploration, while low certainty facilitates search but causes error accumulation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is essential for enforcing the right to be forgotten in machine learning systems. A key challenge of MU is how to reliably audit whether a model has truly forgotten specified training data. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used for unlearning auditing, where samples that evade membership detection are often regarded as successfully forgotten. After carefully revisiting the reliability of MIA, we show that this assumption is flawed: failed membership inference does not imply true forgetting. We theoretically demonstrate that MIA-based auditing, when formulated as a binary classification problem, inevitably incurs statistical errors whose magnitude cannot be observed during the auditing process. This leads to overly optimistic evaluations of unlearning performance, while incurring substantial computational overhead due to shadow model training. To address these limitations, we propose Statistical Membership Inference Attack (SMIA), a novel training-free and highly effective auditing framework. SMIA directly compares the distributions of member and non-member data using statistical tests, eliminating the need for learned attack models. Moreover, SMIA outputs both a forgetting rate and a corresponding confidence interval, enabling quantified reliability of the auditing results. Extensive experiments show that SMIA provides more reliable auditing with significantly lower computational cost than existing MIA-based approaches. Notably, the theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness of SMIA suggest it as a new paradigm for reliable machine unlearning auditing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Palindromic/Reverse-Complement Duplication Correcting Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01151</link><description>arXiv:2602.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in in-vivo DNA storage, we study codes for correcting duplications. A reverse-complement duplication of length $k$ is the insertion of the reversed and complemented copy of a substring of length $k$ adjacent to its original position, while a palindromic duplication only inserts the reversed copy without complementation. We first construct an explicit code with a single redundant symbol capable of correcting an arbitrary number of reverse-complement duplications (respectively, palindromic duplications), provided that all duplications have length $k \ge 3\lceil \log_q n \rceil$ and are disjoint. Next, we derive a Gilbert-Varshamov bound for codes that can correct a reverse-complement duplication (respectively, palindromic duplication) of arbitrary length, showing that the optimal redundancy is upper bounded by $2\log_q n + \log_q\log_q n + O(1)$. Finally, for $q \ge 4$, we present two explicit constructions of codes that can correct $t$ length-one reverse-complement duplications. The first construction achieves a redundancy of $2t\log_q n + O(\log_q\log_q n)$ with encoding complexity $O(n)$ and decoding complexity $O\big(n(\log_2 n)^4\big)$. The second construction achieves an improved redundancy of $(2t-1)\log_q n + O(\log_q\log_q n)$, but with encoding and decoding complexities of $O\big(n \cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log_2 n)\big)$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniForce: A Unified Latent Force Model for Robot Manipulation with Diverse Tactile Sensors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01153</link><description>arXiv:2602.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Force sensing is essential for dexterous robot manipulation, but scaling force-aware policy learning is hindered by the heterogeneity of tactile sensors. Differences in sensing principles (e.g., optical vs. magnetic), form factors, and materials typically require sensor-specific data collection, calibration, and model training, thereby limiting generalisability. We propose UniForce, a novel unified tactile representation learning framework that learns a shared latent force space across diverse tactile sensors. UniForce reduces cross-sensor domain shift by jointly modeling inverse dynamics (image-to-force) and forward dynamics (force-to-image), constrained by force equilibrium and image reconstruction losses to produce force-grounded representations. To avoid reliance on expensive external force/torque (F/T) sensors, we exploit static equilibrium and collect force-paired data via direct sensor--object--sensor interactions, enabling cross-sensor alignment with contact force. The resulting universal tactile encoder can be plugged into downstream force-aware robot manipulation tasks with zero-shot transfer, without retraining or finetuning. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tactile sensors including GelSight, TacTip, and uSkin, demonstrate consistent improvements in force estimation over prior methods, and enable effective cross-sensor coordination in Vision-Tactile-Language-Action (VTLA) models for a robotic wiping task. Code and datasets will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01153v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A class of pseudorandom sequences From Function Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01154</link><description>arXiv:2602.01154v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Modern vehicles generate thousands of different discrete events known as Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). Automotive manufacturers use Boolean combinations of these codes, called error patterns (EPs), to characterize system faults and ensure vehicle safety. Yet, EP rules are still manually handcrafted by domain experts, a process that is expensive and prone to errors as vehicle complexity grows. This paper introduces CAREP (Causal Automated Reasoning for Error Patterns), a multi-agent system that automatizes the generation of EP rules from high-dimensional event sequences of DTCs. CAREP combines a causal discovery agent that identifies potential DTC-EP relations, a contextual information agent that integrates metadata and descriptions, and an orchestrator agent that synthesizes candidate boolean rules together with interpretable reasoning traces. Evaluation on a large-scale automotive dataset with over 29,100 unique DTCs and 474 error patterns demonstrates that CAREP can automatically and accurately discover the unknown EP rules, outperforming LLM-only baselines while providing transparent causal explanations. By uniting practical causal discovery and agent-based reasoning, CAREP represents a step toward fully automated fault diagnostics, enabling scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient vehicle maintenance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01155v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PolicyFlow: Policy Optimization with Continuous Normalizing Flow in Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01156</link><description>arXiv:2602.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) demonstrates is widely favored for its simplicity, numerical stability, and strong empirical performance. Standard PPO relies on surrogate objectives defined via importance ratios, which require evaluating policy likelihood that is typically straightforward when the policy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, extending PPO to more expressive, high-capacity policy models such as continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), also known as flow-matching models, is challenging because likelihood evaluation along the full flow trajectory is computationally expensive and often numerically unstable. To resolve this issue, we propose PolicyFlow, a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates expressive CNF policies with PPO-style objectives without requiring likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead without compromising training stability. To further prevent mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, we propose the Brownian Regularizer, an implicit policy entropy regularizer inspired by Brownian motion, which is conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks across various environments including MultiGoal, PointMaze, IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO using Gaussian policies and flow-based baselines including FPO and DPPO. Notably, results on MultiGoal highlight PolicyFlow's ability to capture richer multimodal action distributions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Horizon Electricity Price Forecasting with Deep Learning in the Australian National Electricity Market</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01157</link><description>arXiv:2602.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for operational planning, trading, and flexible asset scheduling in liberalised power systems, yet remains challenging due to volatility, heavy-tailed spikes, and frequent regime shifts. While deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted in EPF to capture complex and nonlinear price dynamics, several important gaps persist: (i) limited attention to multi-day horizons beyond day-ahead forecasting, (ii) insufficient exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series DL models, and (iii) a predominant reliance on aggregated horizon-level evaluation that obscures time-of-day forecasting variation. To address these gaps, we propose a novel EPF framework that extends the forecast horizon to multi-day-ahead by systematically building forecasting models that leverage benchmarked SOTA time series DL models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to analyse time-of-day forecasting performance by integrating model assessment at intraday interval levels across all five regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results show that no single model consistently dominates across regions, metrics, and horizons. Overall, standard DL models deliver superior performance in most regions, while SOTA time series DL models demonstrate greater robustness to forecast horizon extension. Intraday interval-level evaluation reveals pronounced diurnal error patterns, indicating that absolute errors peak during the evening ramp, relative errors inflate during midday negative-price regimes, and directional accuracy degrades during periods of frequent trend changes. These findings suggest that future research on DL-based EPF can benefit from enriched feature representations and modelling strategies that enhance longer-term forecasting robustness while maintaining sensitivity to intraday volatility and structural price dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01157v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Models by Restoring Corrupted Visual Inputs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01158</link><description>arXiv:2602.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generalist robotic manipulation, unifying perception and control within a single end-to-end architecture. However, despite their success in controlled environments, reliable real-world deployment is severely hindered by their fragility to visual disturbances. While existing literature extensively addresses physical occlusions caused by scene geometry, a critical mode remains largely unexplored: image corruptions. These sensor-level artifacts, ranging from electronic noise and dead pixels to lens contaminants, directly compromise the integrity of the visual signal prior to interpretation. In this work, we quantify this vulnerability, demonstrating that state-of-the-art VLAs such as $\pi_{0.5}$ and SmolVLA, suffer catastrophic performance degradation, dropping from 90\% success rates to as low as 2\%, under common signal artifacts. To mitigate this, we introduce the Corruption Restoration Transformer (CRT), a plug-and-play and model-agnostic vision transformer designed to immunize VLA models against sensor disturbances. Leveraging an adversarial training objective, CRT restores clean observations from corrupted inputs without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning of the underlying model. Extensive experiments across the LIBERO and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that CRT effectively recovers lost performance, enabling VLAs to maintain near-baseline success rates, even under severe visual corruption.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01158v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DTAMS: High-Capacity Generative Steganography via Dynamic Multi-Timestep Selection and Adaptive Deviation Mapping in Latent Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01160</link><description>arXiv:2602.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of AIGC technologies, generative image steganography has attracted increasing attention due to its high imperceptibility and flexibility. However, existing generative steganography methods often maintain acceptable security and robustness only at relatively low embedding rates, severely limiting the practical applicability of steganographic systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel DTAMS framework that achieves high embedding rates while ensuring strong robustness and security. Specifically, a dynamic multi-timestep adaptive embedding mechanism is constructed based on transition-cost modeling in diffusion models, enabling automatic selection of optimal embedding timesteps to improve embedding rates while preserving overall performance. Meanwhile, we propose a global sub-interval mapping strategy that jointly considers mapping errors and the frequency distribution of secret information, converting point-wise perturbations into interval-level statistical mappings to suppress error accumulation and distribution drift during multi-step diffusion processes. Furthermore, a multi-dimensional joint constraint mechanism is introduced to mitigate distortions caused by repeated latent-pixel transformations by jointly regularizing embedding errors at the pixel, latent, and semantic levels. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an embedding rate of 12 bpp while maintaining excellent security and robustness. Across all evaluated conditions, DTAMS reduces the average extraction error rate by 59.39%, representing a significant improvement over SOTA methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01160v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Training for Cultural Awareness: The Role of Dataset Linguistic Structure in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01161</link><description>arXiv:2602.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about cultural misalignment, yet the linguistic properties of fine-tuning datasets used for cultural adaptation remain poorly understood. We adopt a dataset-centric view of cultural alignment and ask which linguistic properties of fine-tuning data are associated with cultural performance, whether these properties are predictive prior to training, and how these effects vary across models. We compute lightweight linguistic, semantic, and structural metrics for Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese datasets and apply principal component analysis separately within each language. This design ensures that the resulting components capture variation among datasets written in the same language rather than differences between languages. The resulting components correspond to broadly interpretable axes related to semantic coherence, surface-level lexical and syntactic diversity, and lexical or structural richness, though their composition varies across languages. We fine-tune three major LLM families (LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek) and evaluate them on benchmarks of cultural knowledge, values, and norms. While PCA components correlate with downstream performance, these associations are strongly model-dependent. Through controlled subset interventions, we show that lexical-oriented components (PC3) are the most robust, yielding more consistent performance across models and benchmarks, whereas emphasizing semantic or diversity extremes (PC1-PC2) is often neutral or harmful.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01161v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Typologically-Informed Candidate Reranking for LLM-based Translation into Low-Resource Languages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01162</link><description>arXiv:2602.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models trained predominantly on high-resource languages exhibit systematic biases toward dominant typological patterns, leading to structural non-conformance when translating into typologically divergent low-resource languages. We present a framework that leverages linguistic typology to improve translation quality without parallel training data or model retraining. The framework consists of two components: the Universal Metalinguistic Framework (UMF), which represents languages as structured profiles across 16 typological dimensions with divergence-weighted scoring, and the Computational Engine, which operates through linguistic disambiguation during generation and typological compliance scoring during selection. Evaluation across nine language pairs demonstrates intervention rates strongly correlating with typological distance from English. In experiments on 341 English sentences each having different morphological and syntactic phenomena, the framework shows an intervention precision of 48.16% for conservatively treated languages, 28.15% for morphologically dense languages, and 86.26% for structurally profiled languages. The framework requires no parallel training data and operates with any LLM capable of producing multiple candidate outputs, enabling practical deployment for under-resourced languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01162v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantically Aware UAV Landing Site Assessment from Remote Sensing Imagery via Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01163</link><description>arXiv:2602.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe UAV emergency landing requires more than just identifying flat terrain; it demands understanding complex semantic risks (e.g., crowds, temporary structures) invisible to traditional geometric sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel framework leveraging Remote Sensing (RS) imagery and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for global context-aware landing site assessment. Unlike local geometric methods, our approach employs a coarse-to-fine pipeline: first, a lightweight semantic segmentation module efficiently pre-screens candidate areas; second, a vision-language reasoning agent fuses visual features with Point-of-Interest (POI) data to detect subtle hazards. To validate this approach, we construct and release the Emergency Landing Site Selection (ELSS) benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms geometric baselines in risk identification accuracy. Furthermore, qualitative results confirm its ability to generate human-like, interpretable justifications, enhancing trust in automated decision-making. The benchmark dataset is publicly accessible at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ELSS-dataset-43D7.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01163v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Reasoning VLA: Latent Thinking and Prediction for Vision-Language-Action Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01166</link><description>arXiv:2602.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models benefit from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but existing approaches incur high inference overhead and rely on discrete reasoning representations that mismatch continuous perception and control. We propose Latent Reasoning VLA (\textbf{LaRA-VLA}), a unified VLA framework that internalizes multi-modal CoT reasoning into continuous latent representations for embodied action. LaRA-VLA performs unified reasoning and prediction in latent space, eliminating explicit CoT generation at inference time and enabling efficient, action-oriented control. To realize latent embodied reasoning, we introduce a curriculum-based training paradigm that progressively transitions from explicit textual and visual CoT supervision to latent reasoning, and finally adapts latent reasoning dynamics to condition action generation. We construct two structured CoT datasets and evaluate LaRA-VLA on both simulation benchmarks and long-horizon real-robot manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that LaRA-VLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLA methods while reducing inference latency by up to 90\% compared to explicit CoT-based approaches, demonstrating latent reasoning as an effective and efficient paradigm for real-time embodied control.

Abstract: Current VLMs have demonstrated capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks. Typically, in a pretrained VLM, all layers are engaged by default to make predictions on downstream tasks. We find that intervening on a single layer, such as by zeroing its parameters, can improve the performance on certain tasks, indicating that some layers hinder rather than help downstream tasks. We systematically investigate how individual layers influence different tasks via layer intervention. Specifically, we measure the change in performance relative to the base model after intervening on each layer and observe improvements when bypassing specific layers. This improvement can be generalizable across models and datasets, indicating the presence of Task-Interfering Layers that harm downstream tasks' performance. We introduce Task-Layer Interaction Vector, which quantifies the effect of intervening on each layer of a VLM given a task. These task-interfering layers exhibit task-specific sensitivity patterns: tasks requiring similar capabilities show consistent response trends under layer interventions, as evidenced by the high similarity in their task-layer interaction vectors. Inspired by these findings, we propose TaLo (Task-Adaptive Layer Knockout), a training-free, test-time adaptation method that dynamically identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for a given task. Without parameter updates, TaLo improves performance across various models and datasets, including boosting Qwen-VL's accuracy on the Maps task in ScienceQA by up to 16.6%. Our work reveals an unexpected form of modularity in pretrained VLMs and provides a plug-and-play, training-free mechanism to unlock hidden capabilities at inference time.

In parallel, it recommends an appropriate strategy from the dialogue context and uses an LLM to generate a response aligned with that strategy. We evaluate on human annotated tutor student dialogues, augmented with additional non pedagogical conversations for the binary task. Results show high performance for pedagogical strategy detection and consistent gains when using data augmentation, while analysis highlights where fine grained classes remain challenging.

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural-language specifications into logic programs is a challenging task that affects neurosymbolic engineering. We present ASP-Bench, a benchmark comprising 128 natural language problem instances, 64 base problems with easy and hard variants. It evaluates systems that translate natural-language problems into Answer Set Programs (ASPs), a prominent form of logic programming. It provides systematic coverage of ASP features, including choice rules, aggregates, and optimization. Each problem includes reference validators that check whether solutions satisfy the problem specification.
  We characterize problems along seven largely independent reasoning aspects (optimization, temporal reasoning, default logic, resource allocation, recursion, spatial reasoning, and quantitative complexity), providing a multidimensional view of modeling difficulty.
  We test the benchmark using an agentic approach based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) framework, which achieves full saturation, demonstrating that feedback-driven iterative refinement with solver feedback provides a reliable and robust approach for modeling natural language in ASP. Our analysis across multiple agent runs enables us to gain insights into what determines a problem's modeling hardness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01171v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EEmo-Logic: A Unified Dataset and Multi-Stage Framework for Comprehensive Image-Evoked Emotion Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01173</link><description>arXiv:2602.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the multi-dimensional attributes and intensity nuances of image-evoked emotions is pivotal for advancing machine empathy and empowering diverse human-computer interaction applications.

Specifically, we compile $1.2M$ question-answering (QA) pairs (EEmoDB-QA) from $125k$ images via automated generation, alongside a $36k$ dataset (EEmoDB-Assess) curated from $25k$ images for fine-grained assessment. Furthermore, we propose EEmo-Logic, an all-in-one multimodal large language model (MLLM) developed via instruction fine-tuning and task-customized group relative preference optimization (GRPO) with novel reward design.

Abstract: Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) is a universal framework for decoding all block codes by testing candidate error patterns (EPs). Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) facilitates parallel implementation of GRAND by exploiting log-likelihood ratio (LLR) rankings but still suffers from high tail latency under unfavorable channel conditions, limiting its use in real-time systems.
  We propose an elimination-aided ORBGRAND scheme that reduces decoding latency by integrating the Rank of the Most Reliable Erroneous (RMRE) bit with a partial Gaussian-elimination (GE) filtering mechanism. The scheme groups and jointly verifies EPs that share the same RMRE, and once a valid EP is identified, the ORBGRAND search is resumed. By leveraging prior GE steps to filter out unnecessary guesses, this approach significantly reduces the number of EPs to be tested, thereby lowering both average and worst-case latency while maintaining error-correction performance.
  Simulation results show that compared to the original ORBGRAND, the elimination-aided ORBGRAND filters out more than 50\% of EPs and correspondingly reduce overall computational complexity, all with no loss in block error rate. This demonstrates that this approach is suitable for ultra-reliable low-latency communication scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01174v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Novel linear, decoupled, and energy dissipative schemes for the Navier-Stokes-Darcy model and extension to related two-phase flow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01175</link><description>arXiv:2602.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct efficient original-energy-dissipative schemes for the Navier-Stokes-Darcy model and related two-phase flows using a prediction-correction framework. A new relaxation technique is incorporated in the correction step to guarantee dissipation of the original energy, thereby ensuring unconditional boundedness of the numerical solutions for velocity and hydraulic head in the $l^{\infty}(L^2)$ and $l^2(H^1)$ norms. At each time step, the schemes require solving only a sequence of linear equations with constant coefficients. We rigorously prove that the schemes dissipate the original energy and, as an example, carry out a rigorous error analysis of the first-order scheme for the Navier-Stokes-Darcy model. Finally, a series of benchmark numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01175v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Fidelity Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification and Adaptive Residual Learning for Efficient Solution of Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01176</link><description>arXiv:2602.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into neural network training. However, solving high-fidelity PDEs remains computationally prohibitive, particularly for parametric systems requiring multiple evaluations across varying parameter configurations. This paper presents MF-BPINN, a novel multi-fidelity framework that synergistically combines physics-informed neural networks with Bayesian uncertainty quantification and adaptive residual learning. Our approach leverages abundant low-fidelity simulations alongside sparse high-fidelity data through a hierarchical neural architecture that learns nonlinear correlations across fidelity levels. We introduce an adaptive residual network with learnable gating mechanisms that dynamically balances linear and nonlinear fidelity discrepancies. Furthermore, we develop a rigorous Bayesian framework employing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01176v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking the Flow-Based Gradual Domain Adaption: A Semi-Dual Optimal Transport Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01179</link><description>arXiv:2602.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) aims to mitigate domain shift by progressively adapting models from the source domain to the target domain via intermediate domains. However, real intermediate domains are often unavailable or ineffective, necessitating the synthesis of intermediate samples. Flow-based models have recently been used for this purpose by interpolating between source and target distributions; however, their training typically relies on sample-based log-likelihood estimation, which can discard useful information and thus degrade GDA performance. The key to addressing this limitation is constructing the intermediate domains via samples directly. To this end, we propose an Entropy-regularized Semi-dual Unbalanced Optimal Transport (E-SUOT) framework to construct intermediate domains. Specifically, we reformulate flow-based GDA as a Lagrangian dual problem and derive an equivalent semi-dual objective that circumvents the need for likelihood estimation. However, the dual problem leads to an unstable min-max training procedure. To alleviate this issue, we further introduce entropy regularization to convert it into a more stable alternative optimization procedure. Based on this, we propose a novel GDA training framework and provide theoretical analysis in terms of stability and generalization. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the E-SUOT framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Energy-efficient Software-defined 5G/6G Multimedia IoV: PID controller-based approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01180</link><description>arXiv:2602.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimedia applications in smart city environments and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) presents significant challenges for existing network infrastructures, particularly with the advent of 5G and emerging 6G technologies. Traditional architectures struggle to meet the demands for scalability, adaptability, and energy efficiency required by data-intensive multimedia services. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative, energy-efficient framework for multimedia resource management in software-defined 5G/6G IoV networks, leveraging a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The framework integrates Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) technologies to enable centralized and adaptive control over network resources. By employing a PID controller, it dynamically manages load distribution and temperature, ensuring balanced resource allocation and minimizing energy waste. Comprehensive simulations validate the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating significant improvements in load balancing, CPU utilization, and energy consumption compared to traditional methods. For instance, under heavy traffic conditions, the proposed framework maintained resource efficiency, reducing power consumption by up to 30% and achieving nearly equal load distribution across all network components. Additionally, the controller exhibited exceptional scalability, effectively responding to over 98% of vehicle requests even in scenarios of extreme traffic demand.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01180v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analyzing and Improving Diffusion Models for Time-Series Data Imputation: A Proximal Recursion Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01182</link><description>arXiv:2602.01182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise for Time-Series Data Imputation (TSDI); however, their performance remains inconsistent in complex scenarios. We attribute this to two primary obstacles: (1) non-stationary temporal dynamics, which can bias the inference trajectory and lead to outlier-sensitive imputations; and (2) objective inconsistency, since imputation favors accurate pointwise recovery whereas DMs are inherently trained to generate diverse samples. To better understand these issues, we analyze DM-based TSDI process through a proximal-operator perspective and uncover that an implicit Wasserstein distance regularization inherent in the process hinders the model's ability to counteract non-stationarity and dissipative regularizer, thereby amplifying diversity at the expense of fidelity. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework called SPIRIT (Semi-Proximal Transport Regularized time-series Imputation). Specifically, we introduce entropy-induced Bregman divergence to relax the mass preserving constraint in the Wasserstein distance, formulate the semi-proximal transport (SPT) discrepancy, and theoretically prove the robustness of SPT against non-stationarity. Subsequently, we remove the dissipative structure and derive the complete SPIRIT workflow, with SPT serving as the proximal operator. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SPIRIT approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01182v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Refining Context-Entangled Content Segmentation via Curriculum Selection and Anti-Curriculum Promotion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01183</link><description>arXiv:2602.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological learning proceeds from easy to difficult tasks, gradually reinforcing perception and robustness. Inspired by this principle, we address Context-Entangled Content Segmentation (CECS), a challenging setting where objects share intrinsic visual patterns with their surroundings, as in camouflaged object detection. Conventional segmentation networks predominantly rely on architectural enhancements but often ignore the learning dynamics that govern robustness under entangled data distributions. We introduce CurriSeg, a dual-phase learning framework that unifies curriculum and anti-curriculum principles to improve representation reliability. In the Curriculum Selection phase, CurriSeg dynamically selects training data based on the temporal statistics of sample losses, distinguishing hard-but-informative samples from noisy or ambiguous ones, thus enabling stable capability enhancement. In the Anti-Curriculum Promotion phase, we design Spectral-Blindness Fine-Tuning, which suppresses high-frequency components to enforce dependence on low-frequency structural and contextual cues and thus strengthens generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CurriSeg achieves consistent improvements across diverse CECS benchmarks without adding parameters or increasing total training time, offering a principled view of how progression and challenge interplay to foster robust and context-aware segmentation. Code will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01183v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FedBGS: A Blockchain Approach to Segment Gossip Learning in Decentralized Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01185</link><description>arXiv:2602.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a Decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables multiple participants to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their data with the integration of cryptographic and privacy-based techniques to enhance the security of the global system. This privacy-oriented approach makes PPFL a highly suitable solution for training shared models in sectors where data privacy is a critical concern. In traditional FL, local models are trained on edge devices, and only model updates are shared with a central server, which aggregates them to improve the global model. However, despite the presence of the aforementioned privacy techniques, in the classical Federated structure, the issue of the server as a single-point-of-failure remains, leading to limitations both in terms of security and scalability. This paper introduces FedBGS, a fully Decentralized Blockchain-based framework that leverages Segmented Gossip Learning through Federated Analytics. The proposed system aims to optimize blockchain usage while providing comprehensive protection against all types of attacks, ensuring both privacy, security and non-IID data handling in Federated environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Gaussian-Head OFL Family: One-Shot Federated Learning from Client Global Statistics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01186</link><description>arXiv:2602.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Federated Learning relies on a multi-round iterative process of model exchange and aggregation between server and clients, with high communication costs and privacy risks from repeated model transmissions. In contrast, one-shot federated learning (OFL) alleviates these limitations by reducing communication to a single round, thereby lowering overhead and enhancing practical deployability. Nevertheless, most existing one-shot approaches remain either impractical or constrained, for example, they often depend on the availability of a public dataset, assume homogeneous client models, or require uploading additional data or model information. To overcome these issues, we introduce the Gaussian-Head OFL (GH-OFL) family, a suite of one-shot federated methods that assume class-conditional Gaussianity of pretrained embeddings. Clients transmit only sufficient statistics (per-class counts and first/second-order moments) and the server builds heads via three components: (i) Closed-form Gaussian heads (NB/LDA/QDA) computed directly from the received statistics; (ii) FisherMix, a linear head with cosine margin trained on synthetic samples drawn in an estimated Fisher subspace; and (iii) Proto-Hyper, a lightweight low-rank residual head that refines Gaussian logits via knowledge distillation on those synthetic samples. In our experiments, GH-OFL methods deliver state-of-the-art robustness and accuracy under strong non-IID skew while remaining strictly data-free.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autoregressive, Yet Revisable: In Decoding Revision for Secure Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01187</link><description>arXiv:2602.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based code generation is predominantly formulated as a strictly monotonic process, appending tokens linearly to an immutable prefix. This formulation contrasts to the cognitive process of programming, which is inherently interleaved with forward generation and on-the-fly revision. While prior works attempt to introduce revision via post-hoc agents or external static tools, they either suffer from high latency or fail to leverage the model's intrinsic semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose Stream of Revision, a paradigm shift that elevates code generation from a monotonic stream to a dynamic, self-correcting trajectory by leveraging model's intrinsic capabilities. We introduce specific action tokens that enable the model to seamlessly backtrack and edit its own history within a single forward pass. By internalizing the revision loop, our framework Stream of Revision allows the model to activate its latent capabilities just-in-time without external dependencies. Empirical results on secure code generation show that Stream of Revision significantly reduces vulnerabilities with minimal inference overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01187v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Obstacle-free Trajectory Planning for UAVs in an Unknown Dynamic Environment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01189</link><description>arXiv:2602.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of reactive motion planning for quadrotors operating in unknown environments with dynamic obstacles. Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01189v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Lexical Ambiguity and Vision: A Mini Review on Visual Word Sense Disambiguation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01193</link><description>arXiv:2602.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a mini review of Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD), which is a multimodal extension of traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). VWSD helps tackle lexical ambiguity in vision-language tasks. While conventional WSD depends only on text and lexical resources, VWSD uses visual cues to find the right meaning of ambiguous words with minimal text input. The review looks at developments from early multimodal fusion methods to new frameworks that use contrastive models like CLIP, diffusion-based text-to-image generation, and large language model (LLM) support. Studies from 2016 to 2025 are examined to show the growth of VWSD through feature-based, graph-based, and contrastive embedding techniques. It focuses on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and adapting to multiple languages. Quantitative results show that CLIP-based fine-tuned models and LLM-enhanced VWSD systems consistently perform better than zero-shot baselines, achieving gains of up to 6-8\% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). However, challenges still exist, such as limitations in context, model bias toward common meanings, a lack of multilingual datasets, and the need for better evaluation frameworks. The analysis highlights the growing overlap of CLIP alignment, diffusion generation, and LLM reasoning as the future path for strong, context-aware, and multilingual disambiguation systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01193v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EMFormer: Efficient Multi-Scale Transformer for Accumulative Context Weather Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01194</link><description>arXiv:2602.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term weather forecasting is critical for socioeconomic planning and disaster preparedness. While recent approaches employ finetuning to extend prediction horizons, they remain constrained by the issues of catastrophic forgetting, error accumulation, and high training overhead. To address these limitations, we present a novel pipeline across pretraining, finetuning and forecasting to enhance long-context modeling while reducing computational overhead. First, we introduce an Efficient Multi-scale Transformer (EMFormer) to extract multi-scale features through a single convolution in both training and inference. Based on the new architecture, we further employ an accumulative context finetuning to improve temporal consistency without degrading short-term accuracy. Additionally, we propose a composite loss that dynamically balances different terms via a sinusoidal weighting, thereby adaptively guiding the optimization trajectory throughout pretraining and finetuning. Experiments show that our approach achieves strong performance in weather forecasting and extreme event prediction, substantially improving long-term forecast accuracy. Moreover, EMFormer demonstrates strong generalization on vision benchmarks (ImageNet-1K and ADE20K) while delivering a 5.69x speedup over conventional multi-scale modules.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unraveling the Hidden Dynamical Structure in Recurrent Neural Policies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01196</link><description>arXiv:2602.01196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural policies are widely used in partially observable control and meta-RL tasks. Their abilities to maintain internal memory and adapt quickly to unseen scenarios have offered them unparalleled performance when compared to non-recurrent counterparts. However, until today, the underlying mechanisms for their superior generalization and robustness performance remain poorly understood. In this study, by analyzing the hidden state domain of recurrent policies learned over a diverse set of training methods, model architectures, and tasks, we find that stable cyclic structures consistently emerge during interaction with the environment. Such cyclic structures share a remarkable similarity with \textit{limit cycles} in dynamical system analysis, if we consider the policy and the environment as a joint hybrid dynamical system. Moreover, we uncover that the geometry of such limit cycles also has a structured correspondence with the policies' behaviors. These findings offer new perspectives to explain many nice properties of recurrent policies: the emergence of limit cycles stabilizes both the policies' internal memory and the task-relevant environmental states, while suppressing nuisance variability arising from environmental uncertainty; the geometry of limit cycles also encodes relational structures of behaviors, facilitating easier skill adaptation when facing non-stationary environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A State-Transition Framework for Efficient LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01198</link><description>arXiv:2602.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning significantly improves Large Language Models (LLMs) performance on complex reasoning tasks, the substantial computational and memory costs of generating long CoT sequences limit their efficiency and practicality. Existing studies usually enhance the reasoning efficiency of LLMs by compressing CoT sequences. However, this approach conflicts with test-time scaling, limiting the reasoning capacity of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an efficient reasoning framework that models the reasoning process of LLMs as a state-transition process. Specifically, we first apply a linear attention mechanism to estimate the LLM's reasoning state, which records the historical reasoning information from previous reasoning steps. Then, based on the query prompt and the reasoning state, the LLM can efficiently perform the current reasoning step and update the state. With the linear attention, each token in the current reasoning step can directly retrieve relevant historical reasoning information from the reasoning state, without explicitly attending to tokens in previous reasoning steps. In this way, the computational complexity of attention is reduced from quadratic to linear, significantly improving the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. In addition, we propose a state-based reasoning strategy to mitigate the over-thinking issue caused by noisy reasoning steps. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and model sizes demonstrate that our framework not only improves the reasoning efficiency of LLMs but also enhances their reasoning performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Med3D-R1: Incentivizing Clinical Reasoning in 3D Medical Vision-Language Models for Abnormality Diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01200</link><description>arXiv:2602.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing 3D vision-language models with robust clinical reasoning remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity of volumetric medical imaging, the tendency of models to overfit superficial report patterns, and the lack of interpretability-aware reward designs. In this paper, we propose Med3D-R1, a reinforcement learning framework with a two-stage training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). During SFT stage, we introduce a residual alignment mechanism to bridge the gap between high-dimensional 3D features and textual embeddings, and an abnormality re-weighting strategy to emphasize clinically informative tokens and reduce structural bias in reports. In RL stage, we redesign the consistency reward to explicitly promote coherent, step-by-step diagnostic reasoning. We evaluate our method on medical multiple-choice visual question answering using two 3D diagnostic benchmarks, CT-RATE and RAD-ChestCT, where our model attains state-of-the-art accuracies of 41.92\% on CT-RATE and 44.99\% on RAD-ChestCT. These results indicate improved abnormality diagnosis and clinical reasoning and outperform prior methods on both benchmarks. Overall, our approach holds promise for enhancing real-world diagnostic workflows by enabling more reliable and transparent 3D medical vision-language systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Talk to Me, Not the Slides: A Real-Time Wearable Assistant for Improving Eye Contact in Presentations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01201</link><description>arXiv:2602.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective eye contact is a cornerstone of successful public speaking. It strengthens the speaker's credibility and fosters audience engagement. Yet, managing effective eye contact is a skill that demands extensive training and practice, often posing a significant challenge for novice speakers. In this paper, we present SpeakAssis, the first real-time, in-situ wearable system designed to actively assist speakers in maintaining effective eye contact during live presentations. Leveraging a head-mounted eye tracker for gaze and scene view capture, SpeakAssis continuously monitors and analyzes the speaker's gaze distribution across audience and non-audience regions. When ineffective eye-contact patterns are detected, such as insufficient eye contact, or neglect of certain audience segments, SpeakAssis provides timely, context-aware audio prompts via an earphone to guide the speaker's gaze behavior. We evaluate SpeakAssis through a user study involving eight speakers and 24 audience members. Quantitative results show that SpeakAssis increases speakers' eye-contact duration by 62.5% on average and promotes a more balanced distribution of visual attention. Additionally, statistical analysis based on audience surveys reveals that improvements in speaker's eye-contact behavior significantly enhance the audience's perceived engagement and interactivity during presentations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01201v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Workflow-R1: Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization for Multi-turn Workflow Construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01202</link><description>arXiv:2602.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic workflows has demonstrated strong performance of LLM-based agents in addressing complex reasoning tasks. However, existing workflow optimization methods typically formulate workflow synthesis as a static, one-shot code-centric generation problem. This paradigm imposes excessive constraints on the model's coding capabilities and restricts the flexibility required for dynamic problem-solving. In this paper, we present Workflow-R1, a framework that reformulates workflow construction as a multi-turn, natural language-based sequential decision-making process. To resolve the optimization granularity mismatch inherent in such multi-turn interactions, we introduce Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization (GSsPO). While explicitly tailored to align with the interleaved Think-Action dynamics of agentic reasoning, GSsPO fundamentally functions as a structure-aware RL algorithm generalizable to a broad class of multi-turn agentic sequential decision-making tasks. By recalibrating the optimization unit to the composite sub-sequence, specifically the atomic Think-Action cycle, it aligns gradient updates with the semantic boundaries of these interactions, ensuring robust learning in complex multi-turn reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA benchmarks, Workflow-R1 outperforms competitive baselines, validating GSsPO as a generalized solution for sequential reasoning and establishing Workflow-R1 as a promising new paradigm for automated workflow optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention Sink Forges Native MoE in Attention Layers: Sink-Aware Training to Address Head Collapse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01203</link><description>arXiv:2602.01203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often assign disproportionate attention to the first token, a phenomenon known as the attention sink. Several recent approaches aim to address this issue, including Sink Attention in GPT-OSS and Gated Attention in Qwen3-Next. However, a comprehensive analysis of the relationship among these attention mechanisms is lacking. In this work, we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that the sink in Vanilla Attention and Sink Attention naturally construct a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism within attention layers. This insight explains the head collapse phenomenon observed in prior work, where only a fixed subset of attention heads contributes to generation. To mitigate head collapse, we propose a sink-aware training algorithm with an auxiliary load balancing loss designed for attention layers. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves effective head load balancing and improves model performance across Vanilla Attention, Sink Attention, and Gated Attention. We hope this study offers a new perspective on attention mechanisms and encourages further exploration of the inherent MoE structure within attention layers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01203v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ASTER: Agentic Scaling with Tool-integrated Extended Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01204</link><description>arXiv:2602.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for eliciting long-horizon reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, scaling Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) via RL remains challenging due to interaction collapse: a pathological state where models fail to sustain multi-turn tool usage, instead degenerating into heavy internal reasoning with only trivial, post-hoc code verification. We systematically study three questions: (i) how cold-start SFT induces an agentic, tool-using behavioral prior, (ii) how the interaction density of cold-start trajectories shapes exploration and downstream RL outcomes, and (iii) how the RL interaction budget affects learning dynamics and generalization under varying inference-time budgets. We then introduce ASTER (Agentic Scaling with Tool-integrated Extended Reasoning), a framework that circumvents this collapse through a targeted cold-start strategy prioritizing interaction-dense trajectories. We find that a small expert cold-start set of just 4K interaction-dense trajectories yields the strongest downstream performance, establishing a robust prior that enables superior exploration during extended RL training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ASTER-4B achieves state-of-the-art results on competitive mathematical benchmarks, reaching 90.0% on AIME 2025, surpassing leading frontier open-source models, including DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01204v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Addressing Explainability of Generative AI using SMILE (Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01206</link><description>arXiv:2602.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled models capable of producing complex textual and visual outputs; however, their decision-making processes remain largely opaque, limiting trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. This thesis introduces gSMILE, a unified framework for the explainability of generative models, extending the Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations (SMILE) method to generative settings. gSMILE employs controlled perturbations of textual input, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted surrogate modelling to quantify and visualise how specific components of a prompt or instruction influence model outputs. Applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), gSMILE provides fine-grained token-level attribution and generates intuitive heatmaps that highlight influential tokens and reasoning pathways. In instruction-based image editing models, the exact text-perturbation mechanism is employed, allowing for the analysis of how modifications to an editing instruction impact the resulting image. Combined with a scenario-based evaluation strategy grounded in the Operational Design Domain (ODD) framework, gSMILE allows systematic assessment of model behaviour across diverse semantic and environmental conditions. To evaluate explanation quality, we define rigorous attribution metrics, including stability, fidelity, accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness, and apply them across multiple generative architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that gSMILE produces robust, human-aligned attributions and generalises effectively across state-of-the-art generative models. These findings highlight the potential of gSMILE to advance transparent, reliable, and responsible deployment of generative AI technologies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01206v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Not All Preferences Are Created Equal: Stability-Aware and Gradient-Efficient Alignment for Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01207</link><description>arXiv:2602.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference-based alignment is pivotal for training large reasoning models; however, standard methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, overlooking the evolving utility of training instances. This static approach often leads to inefficient or unstable optimization, as it wastes computation on trivial pairs with negligible gradients and suffers from noise induced by samples near uncertain decision boundaries. Facing these challenges, we propose SAGE (Stability-Aware Gradient Efficiency), a dynamic framework designed to enhance alignment reliability by maximizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of policy updates. Concretely, SAGE integrates a coarse-grained curriculum mechanism that refreshes candidate pools based on model competence with a fine-grained, stability-aware scoring function that prioritizes informative, confident errors while filtering out unstable samples. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAGE significantly accelerates convergence and outperforms static baselines, highlighting the critical role of policy-aware, stability-conscious data selection in reasoning alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chronos: Learning Temporal Dynamics of Reasoning Chains for Test-Time Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01208</link><description>arXiv:2602.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has emerged as an effective paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods -- most notably majority voting and heuristic token-level scoring -- treat reasoning traces or tokens equally, thereby being susceptible to substantial variations in trajectory quality and localized logical failures. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Chronos}, a lightweight and plug-and-play chronological reasoning scorer that models each trajectory as a time series. Specifically, Chronos learns to capture trajectory features of token probabilities, assigns quality scores accordingly, and employs a weighted voting mechanism. Extensive evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that Chronos consistently delivers substantial gains across a variety of models, with negligible computational overhead. Notably, Chronos@128 achieves relative improvements of 34.21\% over Pass@1 and 22.70\% over Maj@128 on HMMT25 using Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, highlighting its effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SimpleGPT: Improving GPT via A Simple Normalization Strategy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01212</link><description>arXiv:2602.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit Transformer optimization through the lens of second-order geometry and establish a direct connection between architectural design, activation scale, the Hessian matrix, and the maximum tolerable learning rate. We introduce a simple normalization strategy, termed SimpleNorm, which stabilizes intermediate activation scales by construction. Then, by analyzing the Hessian of the loss with respect to network activations, we theoretically show that SimpleNorm significantly reduces the spectral norm of the Hessian, thereby permitting larger stable learning rates. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on large GPT models at parameter scales 1B, 1.4B, 7B and 8B. Empirically, SimpleGPT, our SimpleNorm-based network, tolerates learning rates 3$\times$-10$\times$ larger than standard convention, consistently demonstrates strong optimization stability, and achieves substantially better performance than well-established baselines. Specifically, when training 7B-scale models for 60K steps, SimpleGPT achieves a training loss that is 0.08 lower than that of LLaMA2 with QKNorm, reducing the loss from 2.290 to 2.208.

Abstract: Competitive games pose steep learning curves and strong social pressures, often discouraging novice players and limiting sustained engagement. To address these challenges, this study introduces LeagueBot, a large language model-based voice chatbot designed to provide both informational and emotional support during live gameplay in league of legends, one of the most competitive multiplayer online battle arena games. In a within-subjects experiment with 33 novice players, LeagueBot was found to reduce cognitive challenge, performative challenge, and perceived tension. Qualitative analysis further identified three themes: enhanced access to game information, relief from cognitive burden, and practical limitations. Participants noted that LeagueBot offered context-appropriate guidance and emotional support, helping ease the steep learning curve and psychological pressures of competitive gaming. Together, these findings underscore the potential of voice-based LLM companions to assist novice players in competitive environments and highlight their broader applicability for real-time support in other high-pressure contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01213v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning from Anonymized and Incomplete Tabular Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01217</link><description>arXiv:2602.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User-driven privacy allows individuals to control whether and at what granularity their data is shared, leading to datasets that mix original, generalized, and missing values within the same records and attributes. While such representations are intuitive for privacy, they pose challenges for machine learning, which typically treats non-original values as new categories or as missing, thereby discarding generalization semantics. For learning from such tabular data, we propose novel data transformation strategies that account for heterogeneous anonymization and evaluate them alongside standard imputation and LLM-based approaches. We employ multiple datasets, privacy configurations, and deployment scenarios, demonstrating that our method reliably regains utility. Our results show that generalized values are preferable to pure suppression, that the best data preparation strategy depends on the scenario, and that consistent data representations are crucial for maintaining downstream utility. Overall, our findings highlight that effective learning is tied to the appropriate handling of anonymized values.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01217v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MiTA Attention: Efficient Fast-Weight Scaling via a Mixture of Top-$k$ Activations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01219</link><description>arXiv:2602.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attention operator in Transformers can be viewed as a two-layer fast-weight MLP, whose weights are dynamically instantiated from input tokens and whose width equals sequence length $N$. As the context extends, the expressive capacity of such an $N$-width MLP increases, but scaling its fast weights becomes prohibitively expensive for extremely long sequences. Recently, this fast-weight scaling perspective has motivated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention, which partitions the sequence into fast-weight experts and sparsely routes the tokens to them. In this paper, we elevate this perspective to a unifying framework for a wide range of efficient attention methods by interpreting them as scaling fast weights through routing and/or compression. Then we propose a compress-and-route strategy, which compresses the $N$-width MLP into a narrower one using a small set of landmark queries and constructs deformable experts by gathering top-$k$ activated key-value pairs for each landmark query. We call this strategy a Mixture of Top-$k$ Activations (MiTA), and refer to the resulting efficient mechanism as MiTA attention. Preliminary experiments on vision tasks demonstrate the promise of our MiTA attention and motivate further investigation on its optimization and broader applications in more challenging settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Complexity Bound for Determinisation of Min-Plus Weighted Automata</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01221</link><description>arXiv:2602.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determinisation problem for min-plus (tropical) weighted automata was recently shown to be decidable. However, the proof is purely existential, relying on several non-constructive arguments. Our contribution in this work is twofold: first, we present the first complexity bound for this problem, placing it in the Fast-growing hierarchy. Second, our techniques introduce a versatile framework to analyse runs of weighted automata in a constructive manner. In particular, this significantly simplifies the previous decidability argument and provides a tighter analysis, thus serving as a critical step towards a tight complexity bound.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01221v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FutureMind: Equipping Small Language Models with Strategic Thinking-Pattern Priors via Adaptive Knowledge Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01222</link><description>arXiv:2602.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are attractive for cost-sensitive and resource-limited settings due to their efficient, low-latency inference. However, they often struggle with complex, knowledge-intensive tasks that require structured reasoning and effective retrieval. To address these limitations, we propose FutureMind, a modular reasoning framework that equips SLMs with strategic thinking-pattern priors via adaptive knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs). FutureMind introduces a dynamic reasoning pipeline composed of four key modules: Problem Analysis, Logical Reasoning, Strategy Planning, and Retrieval Guidance. This pipeline is augmented by three distinct retrieval paradigms that decompose complex queries into tractable subproblems, ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval execution. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks, including 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, Bamboogle, and Frames, demonstrate the superiority of FutureMind. It consistently outperforms strong baselines such as Search-o1, achieving state-of-the-art results under free training conditions across diverse SLM architectures and scales. Beyond empirical gains, our analysis reveals that the process of thinking-pattern distillation is restricted by the cognitive bias bottleneck between the teacher (LLMs) and student (SLMs) models. This provides new perspectives on the transferability of reasoning skills, paving the way for the development of SLMs that combine efficiency with genuine cognitive capability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01222v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SkySim: A ROS2-based Simulation Environment for Natural Language Control of Drone Swarms using Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01226</link><description>arXiv:2602.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer versatile applications in logistics, agriculture, and surveillance, yet controlling them requires expert knowledge for safety and feasibility. Traditional static methods limit adaptability, while Large Language Models (LLMs) enable natural language control but generate unsafe trajectories due to lacking physical grounding. This paper introduces SkySim, a ROS2-based simulation framework in Gazebo that decouples LLM high-level planning from low-level safety enforcement. Using Gemini 3.5 Pro, SkySim translates user commands (e.g., "Form a circle") into spatial waypoints, informed by real-time drone states. An Artificial Potential Field (APF) safety filter applies minimal adjustments for collision avoidance, kinematic limits, and geo-fencing, ensuring feasible execution at 20 Hz. Experiments with swarms of 3, 10, and 30 Crazyflie drones validate spatial reasoning accuracy (100% across tested geometric primitives), real-time collision prevention, and scalability. SkySim empowers non-experts to iteratively refine behaviors, bridging AI cognition with robotic safety for dynamic environments. Future work targets hardware integration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01226v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Supervised Fine-Tuning Needs to Unlock the Potential of Token Priority</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01227</link><description>arXiv:2602.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from fitting empirical data to achieving true human utility is fundamentally constrained by a granularity mismatch, where fine-grained autoregressive generation is often supervised by coarse or uniform signals.

Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) CTE transmissions provide in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples whose empirical statistics are strongly governed by the propagation regime. in particular, the distributions differ markedly between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In NLOS, multipath-induced distortions typically degrade Angle-of-Arrivial (AoA) estimation accuracy. Existing BLE direction finding datasets rarely provide tightly controlled, IQ-level paired LOS and NLOS measurements with rigorous statistical validation, and commonly used flat-fading models can be inadequate for cluttered indoor environments exhibiting heavy-tailed power distributions. To address these limitations, we conduct a paired-geometry BLE AoA measurement campaign using an off-the-shelf module, collecting 132000 labeled CTE packets under matched anchor-tag conditions. A robust preprocessing stage removes anomalous CTEs using combined univariate and multivariate criteria. Feature-wise hypothesis tests on IQ-derived power features confirm strong LOS and NLOS separability. All mean differences are statistically significant; additionally, 92 percent of feature-wise variance differences are significant. We further compute L-moment ratios (LMRs) and analyze them in the L-moment Ratio Diagram (LMRD), showing that NLOS subsets exhibit markedly heavier tails and stronger asymmetry than LOS. Kappa-family distributions fitted from LMRs provide substantially improved dual scored L--moment goodness-of-fit (GoF), Specifically, for NLOS, which is the smallest discrepancy in the LMRD and a near-zero standardized L-kurtosis deviation. As a practice, we apply a self-supervised clustering to L-moment statistics, achieving a more separable representation, compared to product moments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01229v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Does Ad-Free Mean Less Data Collection? An Empirical Study of Platform Data Practices and User Expectations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01231</link><description>arXiv:2602.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online platforms increasingly offer "paid" ad-free subscriptions as an alternative to the traditional "free" ad-based model. The transition to ad-free models ostensibly removes advertising as a key justification for data processing under the GDPR. So, normatively, platforms should collect less user data. However, platforms may justify continued data collection as a means to provide an improved, personalized experience. This tension between privacy principles and platform incentives raises a critical underexplored question: do data collection practices vary between ad-free and ad-based subscription models?
  In this paper, we shed light on this important privacy issue by investigating the alignment between platform data collection practices and related user expectations. With respect to data collection process, our analyses of data exports from three major online platforms - Instagram, Facebook, and X - reveal that these platforms continue to retain or collect some ad-related data, even in ad-free subscriptions. With respect to user expectations, our survey among 255 participants on Prolific reveals that 69% of the participants normatively expect data collection to be reduced, indicating their expectation of improved digital privacy in an ad-free model. However, when asked what they think actually happens, 63% of these participants believed that platforms would still collect about the same amount of data, highlighting skepticism about platform practices. Our findings not only indicate a significant disconnect between data practices and normative user expectations, but also raise serious questions about platform compliance with core GDPR principles, such as purpose limitation, data minimization, and transparency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Profit Maximization in Closed Social Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01232</link><description>arXiv:2602.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion of information, innovation, and ideas is an important phenomenon in social networks. Information propagates through the network and reaches from one person to the next. In many settings, it is meaningful to restrict diffusion so that each node can spread information to only a limited number of its neighbors rather than to all of them. Such social networks are called closed social networks. In recent years, social media platforms have emerged as an effective medium for commercial entities, where the objective is to maximize profit. In this paper, we study the Profit Maximization in Closed Social Networks (PMCSN) problem in the context of viral marketing. The input to the problem is a closed social network and two positive integers $\ell$ and $B$. The problem asks to select seed nodes within a given budget $B$; during the diffusion process, each node is restricted to choose at most $\ell$ outgoing links for information diffusion; and the objective is to maximize the profit earned by the seed set. The PMCSN problem generalizes the Influence Maximization problem, which is NP-hard. We propose two solution approaches for PMCSN: a sampling-based approximate solution and a marginal-gain-based heuristic solution. We analyze the sample complexity, running time, and space requirements of the proposed approaches. We conduct experiments on real-world, publicly available social network datasets. The results show that the seed sets and diffusion links chosen by our methods yield higher profit than baseline methods.

Abstract: Training efficiency in large-scale models is typically assessed through memory consumption, training time, and model performance. Current methods often exhibit trade-offs among these metrics, as optimizing one generally degrades at least one of the others. Addressing this trade-off remains a central challenge in algorithm design. While GaLore enables memory-efficient training by updating gradients in a low-rank subspace, it incurs a comparable extra training time cost due to the Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) process on gradients. In this paper, we propose Lotus, a method that resolves this trade-off by simply modifying the projection process. We propose a criterion that quantifies the displacement of the unit gradient to enable efficient transitions between low-rank gradient subspaces. Experimental results indicate that Lotus is the most efficient method, achieving a 30% reduction in training time and a 40% decrease in memory consumption for gradient and optimizer states. Additionally, it outperforms the baseline method in both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01233v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predictive Scheduling for Efficient Inference-Time Reasoning in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01237</link><description>arXiv:2602.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on complex reasoning tasks by generating multiple chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but using a fixed token budget per query leads to over-computation on easy inputs and under-computation on hard ones. We introduce Predictive Scheduling, a plug-and-play framework that pre-runs lightweight predictors, an MLP on intermediate transformer hidden states or a LoRA-fine-tuned classifier on raw question text, to estimate each query's optimal reasoning length or difficulty before any full generation. Our greedy batch allocator dynamically distributes a fixed total token budget across queries to maximize expected accuracy. On the GSM8K arithmetic benchmark, predictive scheduling yields up to 7.9 percentage points of absolute accuracy gain over uniform budgeting at identical token cost, closing over 50\% of the gap to an oracle with perfect foresight. A systematic layer-wise study reveals that middle layers (12 - 17) of the transformer carry the richest signals for size estimation. These results demonstrate that pre-run budget prediction enables fine-grained control of the compute-accuracy trade-off, offering a concrete path toward latency-sensitive, cost-efficient LLM deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01237v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inferential Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01239</link><description>arXiv:2602.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on a wide range of question answering (QA) systems, most existing work focuses on answer containment-i.e., assuming that answers can be directly extracted and/or generated from documents in the corpus. However, some questions require inference, i.e., deriving answers that are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the available information. We introduce Inferential QA -- a new task that challenges models to infer answers from answer-supporting passages which provide only clues. To study this problem, we construct QUIT (QUestions requiring Inference from Texts) dataset, comprising 7,401 questions and 2.4M passages built from high-convergence human- and machine-authored hints, labeled across three relevance levels using LLM-based answerability and human verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of retrievers, rerankers, and LLM-based readers, we show that methods effective on traditional QA tasks struggle in inferential QA: retrievers underperform, rerankers offer limited gains, and fine-tuning provides inconsistent improvements. Even reasoning-oriented LLMs fail to outperform smaller general-purpose models. These findings reveal that current QA pipelines are not yet ready for inference-based reasoning. Inferential QA thus establishes a new class of QA tasks that move towards understanding and reasoning from indirect textual evidence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01239v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Minimizing Mismatch Risk: A Prototype-Based Routing Framework for Zero-shot LLM-generated Text Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01240</link><description>arXiv:2602.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot methods detect LLM-generated text by computing statistical signatures using a surrogate model. Existing approaches typically employ a fixed surrogate for all inputs regardless of the unknown source. We systematically examine this design and find that detection performance varies substantially depending on surrogate-source alignment. We observe that while no single surrogate achieves optimal performance universally, a well-matched surrogate typically exists within a diverse pool for any given input. This finding transforms robust detection into a routing problem: selecting the most appropriate surrogate for each input. We propose DetectRouter, a prototype-based framework that learns text-detector affinity through two-stage training. The first stage constructs discriminative prototypes from white-box models; the second generalizes to black-box sources by aligning geometric distances with observed detection scores. Experiments on EvoBench and MAGE benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple detection criteria and model families.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01240v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large-Scale Terminal Agentic Trajectory Generation from Dockerized Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01244</link><description>arXiv:2602.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training agentic models for terminal-based tasks critically depends on high-quality terminal trajectories that capture realistic long-horizon interactions across diverse domains. However, constructing such data at scale remains challenging due to two key requirements: \textbf{\emph{Executability}}, since each instance requires a suitable and often distinct Docker environment; and \textbf{\emph{Verifiability}}, because heterogeneous task outputs preclude unified, standardized verification. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{TerminalTraj}, a scalable pipeline that (i) filters high-quality repositories to construct Dockerized execution environments, (ii) generates Docker-aligned task instances, and (iii) synthesizes agent trajectories with executable validation code. Using TerminalTraj, we curate 32K Docker images and generate 50,733 verified terminal trajectories across eight domains. Models trained on this data with the Qwen2.5-Coder backbone achieve consistent performance improvements on TerminalBench (TB), with gains of up to 20\% on TB~1.0 and 10\% on TB~2.0 over their respective backbones. Notably, \textbf{TerminalTraj-32B} achieves strong performance among models with fewer than 100B parameters, reaching 35.30\% on TB~1.0 and 22.00\% on TB~2.0, and demonstrates improved test-time scaling behavior.

Abstract: Reasoning-focused Question Answering (QA) has advanced rapidly with Large Language Models (LLMs), yet high-quality benchmarks for low-resource languages remain scarce. Persian, spoken by roughly 130 million people, lacks a comprehensive open-domain resource for evaluating reasoning-capable QA systems. We introduce PARSE, the first open-domain Persian reasoning QA benchmark, containing 10,800 questions across Boolean, multiple-choice, and factoid formats, with diverse reasoning types, difficulty levels, and answer structures. The benchmark is built via a controlled LLM-based generation pipeline and validated through human evaluation. We also ensure linguistic and factual quality through multi-stage filtering, annotation, and consistency checks. We benchmark multilingual and Persian LLMs under multiple prompting strategies and show that Persian prompts and structured prompting (CoT for Boolean/multiple-choice; few-shot for factoid) improve performance. Fine-tuning further boosts results, especially for Persian-specialized models. These findings highlight how PARSE supports both fair comparison and practical model adaptation. PARSE fills a critical gap in Persian QA research and provides a strong foundation for developing and evaluating reasoning-capable LLMs in low-resource settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01246v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mechanistic Interpretability of Brain-to-Speech Models Across Speech Modes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01247</link><description>arXiv:2602.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-to-speech decoding models demonstrate robust performance in vocalized, mimed, and imagined speech; yet, the fundamental mechanisms via which these models capture and transmit information across different speech modalities are less explored. In this work, we use mechanistic interpretability to causally investigate the internal representations of a neural speech decoder. We perform cross-mode activation patching of internal activations across speech modes, and use tri-modal interpolation to examine whether speech representations vary discretely or continuously. We use coarse-to-fine causal tracing and causal scrubbing to find localized causal structure, allowing us to find internal subspaces that are sufficient for cross-mode transfer. In order to determine how finely distributed these effects are within layers, we perform neuron-level activation patching. We discover that small but not distributed subsets of neurons, rather than isolated units, affect the cross-mode transfer. Our results show that speech modes lie on a shared continuous causal manifold, and cross-mode transfer is mediated by compact, layer-specific subspaces rather than diffuse activity. Together, our findings give a causal explanation for how speech modality information is organized and used in brain-to-speech decoding models, revealing hierarchical and direction-dependent representational structure across speech modes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TraceLLM: Leveraging Large Language Models with Prompt Engineering for Enhanced Requirements Traceability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01253</link><description>arXiv:2602.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Requirements traceability, the process of establishing and maintaining relationships between requirements and various software development artifacts, is paramount for ensuring system integrity and fulfilling requirements throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Traditional methods, including manual and information retrieval models, are labor-intensive, error-prone, and limited by low precision. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for supporting software engineering tasks through advanced language comprehension. However, a substantial gap exists in the systematic design and evaluation of prompts tailored to extract accurate trace links. This paper introduces TraceLLM, a systematic framework for enhancing requirements traceability through prompt engineering and demonstration selection. Our approach incorporates rigorous dataset splitting, iterative prompt refinement, enrichment with contextual roles and domain knowledge, and evaluation across zero- and few-shot settings. We assess prompt generalization and robustness using eight state-of-the-art LLMs on four benchmark datasets representing diverse domains (aerospace, healthcare) and artifact types (requirements, design elements, test cases, regulations). TraceLLM achieves state-of-the-art F2 scores, outperforming traditional IR baselines, fine-tuned models, and prior LLM-based methods. We also explore the impact of demonstration selection strategies, identifying label-aware, diversity-based sampling as particularly effective. Overall, our findings highlight that traceability performance depends not only on model capacity but also critically on the quality of prompt engineering. In addition, the achieved performance suggests that TraceLLM can support semi-automated traceability workflows in which candidate links are reviewed and validated by human analysts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01253v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boosting Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization via Text Refinement and Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01257</link><description>arXiv:2602.01257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, point-supervised temporal action localization has gained significant attention for its effective balance between labeling costs and localization accuracy. However, current methods only consider features from visual inputs, neglecting helpful semantic information from the text side. To address this issue, we propose a Text Refinement and Alignment (TRA) framework that effectively utilizes textual features from visual descriptions to complement the visual features as they are semantically rich. This is achieved by designing two new modules for the original point-supervised framework: a Point-based Text Refinement module (PTR) and a Point-based Multimodal Alignment module (PMA). Specifically, we first generate descriptions for video frames using a pre-trained multimodal model. Next, PTR refines the initial descriptions by leveraging point annotations together with multiple pre-trained models. PMA then projects all features into a unified semantic space and leverages a point-level multimodal feature contrastive learning to reduce the gap between visual and linguistic modalities. Last, the enhanced multi-modal features are fed into the action detector for precise localization. Extensive experimental results on five widely used benchmarks demonstrate the favorable performance of our proposed framework compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our computational overhead analysis shows that the framework can run on a single 24 GB RTX 3090 GPU, indicating its practicality and scalability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sample Efficient Active Algorithms for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01260</link><description>arXiv:2602.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from static data but often suffers from poor coverage of the state-action space and distributional shift problems. This problem can be addressed by allowing limited online interactions to selectively refine uncertain regions of the learned value function, which is referred to as Active Reinforcement Learning (ActiveRL). While there has been good empirical success, no theoretical analysis is available in the literature. We fill this gap by developing a rigorous sample-complexity analysis of ActiveRL through the lens of Gaussian Process (GP) uncertainty modeling. In this respect, we propose an algorithm and using GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, we derive high-probability guarantees showing that an $\epsilon$-optimal policy can be learned with ${\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$ active transitions, improving upon the $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2(1-\gamma)^4)$ rate of purely offline methods. Our results reveal that ActiveRL achieves near-optimal information efficiency, that is, guided uncertainty reduction leads to accelerated value-function convergence with minimal online data. Our analysis builds on GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, bridging Bayesian nonparametric regression and reinforcement learning theories. We conduct several experiments to validate the algorithm and theoretical findings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01260v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scientific Machine Learning for Resilient EV-Grid Planning and Decision Support Under Extreme Events</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01261</link><description>arXiv:2602.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure introduces complex challenges to urban distribution networks, particularly under extreme demand events. A critical barrier to resilience assessment is the scale gap between micro-level charging physics and city-scale planning: minute-resolution deliverability constraints remain invisible in hourly aggregated datasets, causing purely data-driven models to exhibit non-physical behavior in high-stress regimes. This paper develops a five-stage scientific machine learning framework bridging this gap through physics-informed knowledge transfer. Stage 1 learns a temperature-pressure deliverability surface from Swiss DC fast-charging telemetry with monotonicity constraints. Stage 2 performs cross-scale injection via anchored quantile mapping. Stage 3 deploys a dual-head spatio-temporal graph neural network for joint forecasting of demand and service loss rate. Stage 4 simulates backlog dynamics under stress shocks and evaluates policy interventions. Stage 5 couples service outcomes to distribution-grid stress via transformer loading analysis. Validation on the Shenzhen UrbanEV dataset demonstrates that physics injection restores monotone stress-to-risk response (Spearman correlation coefficient equals +1.0 versus -0.8 without injection) and improves forecasting accuracy. Under a representative demand shock, the hybrid policy reduces backlog by 79.1%, restores full service within the study horizon, and limits grid stress to only 2 additional hours. The derived resilience boundary m_crit as a function of epsilon approximately equals 1.7 minus 1.0 times epsilon, providing actionable guidance linking demand flexibility to maximum absorbable stress, enabling risk-aware emergency planning under extreme events.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Shades of Uncertainty: How AI Uncertainty Visualizations Affect Trust in Alzheimer's Predictions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01264</link><description>arXiv:2602.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to support prognosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but adoption remains limited due to a lack of transparency and interpretability, particularly for long-term predictions where uncertainty is intrinsic and outcomes may not be known for years. We position uncertainty visualization as an explainable AI (XAI) technique and examine how it shapes trust, confidence, and reliance when users interpret AI-generated forecasts of future cognitive decline transitions. We conducted two studies, one with general participants (N=37) and one with experts in neuroimaging and neurology (N=10), to compare binary (present/absent) and continuous (saturation) uncertainty encodings. Continuous encodings improved perceived reliability and helped users recognize model limitations, while binary encodings increased momentary confidence, revealing expertise-dependent trade-offs in interpreting future predictions under high uncertainty. These findings surface key challenges in designing uncertainty representations for prognostic AI and culminate in a set of empirically grounded guidelines for creating trustworthy, user-appropriate clinical decision support tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01264v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BicKD: Bilateral Contrastive Knowledge Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01265</link><description>arXiv:2602.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a machine learning framework that transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. The vanilla KD proposed by Hinton et al. has been the dominant approach in logit-based distillation and demonstrates compelling performance. However, it only performs sample-wise probability alignment between teacher and student's predictions, lacking an mechanism for class-wise comparison. Besides, vanilla KD imposes no structural constraint on the probability space. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective methodology, bilateral contrastive knowledge distillation (BicKD). This approach introduces a novel bilateral contrastive loss, which intensifies the orthogonality among different class generalization spaces while preserving consistency within the same class. The bilateral formulation enables explicit comparison of both sample-wise and class-wise prediction patterns between teacher and student. By emphasizing probabilistic orthogonality, BicKD further regularizes the geometric structure of the predictive distribution. Extensive experiments show that our BicKD method enhances knowledge transfer, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques across various model architectures and benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01265v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning for Active Perception in Autonomous Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01266</link><description>arXiv:2602.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of active perception within autonomous navigation in complex, unknown environments. Revisiting the foundational principles of active perception, we introduce an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework in which a robot must not only reach a goal while avoiding obstacles, but also actively control its onboard camera to enhance situational awareness. The policy receives observations comprising the robot state, the current depth frame, and a particularly local geometry representation built from a short history of depth readings. To couple collision-free motion planning with information-driven active camera control, we augment the navigation reward with a voxel-based information metric. This enables an aerial robot to learn a robust policy that balances goal-directed motion with exploratory sensing. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our strategy achieves safer flight compared to using fixed, non-actuated camera baselines while also inducing intrinsic exploratory behaviors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diving into Kronecker Adapters: Component Design Matters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01267</link><description>arXiv:2602.01267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kronecker adapters have emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning large-scale models, enabling high-rank updates through tunable component structures. However, existing work largely treats the component structure as a fixed or heuristic design choice, leaving the dimensions and number of Kronecker components underexplored. In this paper, we identify component structure as a key factor governing the capacity of Kronecker adapters. We perform a fine-grained analysis of both the dimensions and number of Kronecker components. In particular, we show that the alignment between Kronecker adapters and full fine-tuning depends on component configurations. Guided by these insights, we propose Component Designed Kronecker Adapters (CDKA). We further provide parameter-budget-aware configuration guidelines and a tailored training stabilization strategy for practical deployment. Experiments across various natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of CDKA.

Abstract: Recent monocular foundation models excel at zero-shot depth estimation, yet their outputs are inherently relative rather than metric, limiting direct use in robotics and autonomous driving. We leverage the fact that relative depth preserves global layout and boundaries: by calibrating it with sparse range measurements, we transform it into a pseudo metric depth prior. Building on this prior, we design a refinement network that follows the prior where reliable and deviates where necessary, enabling accurate metric predictions from very few labeled samples. The resulting system is particularly effective when curated validation data are unavailable, sustaining stable scale and sharp edges across few-shot regimes. These findings suggest that coupling foundation priors with sparse anchors is a practical route to robust, deployment-ready depth completion under real-world label scarcity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01268v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mixture-of-World Models: Scaling Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning with Modular Latent Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01270</link><description>arXiv:2602.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) is achieving sample efficiency in visual domains where tasks exhibit substantial heterogeneity in both observations and dynamics. Model-based reinforcement learning offers a promising path to improved sample efficiency through world models, but standard monolithic architectures struggle to capture diverse task dynamics, resulting in poor reconstruction and prediction accuracy. We introduce Mixture-of-World Models (MoW), a scalable architecture that combines modular variational autoencoders for task-adaptive visual compression, a hybrid Transformer-based dynamics model with task-conditioned experts and a shared backbone, and a gradient-based task clustering strategy for efficient parameter allocation. On the Atari 100k benchmark, a single MoW agent trained once on 26 Atari games achieves a mean human-normalized score of 110.4%, competitive with the score of 114.2% achieved by STORM, an ensemble of 26 task-specific models, while using 50% fewer parameters. On Meta-World, MoW achieves a 74.5% average success rate within 300 thousand environment steps, establishing a new state of the art. These results demonstrate that MoW provides a scalable and parameter-efficient foundation for generalist world models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01270v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Intents to Actions: Agentic AI in Autonomous Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01271</link><description>arXiv:2602.01271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telecommunication networks are increasingly expected to operate autonomously while supporting heterogeneous services with diverse and often conflicting intents -- that is, performance objectives, constraints, and requirements specific to each service. However, transforming high-level intents -- such as ultra-low latency, high throughput, or energy efficiency -- into concrete control actions (i.e., low-level actuator commands) remains beyond the capability of existing heuristic approaches. This work introduces an Agentic AI system for intent-driven autonomous networks, structured around three specialized agents. A supervisory interpreter agent, powered by language models, performs both lexical parsing of intents into executable optimization templates and cognitive refinement based on feedback, constraint feasibility, and evolving network conditions. An optimizer agent converts these templates into tractable optimization problems, analyzes trade-offs, and derives preferences across objectives. Lastly, a preference-driven controller agent, based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, leverages these preferences to operate near the Pareto frontier of network performance that best satisfies the original intent. Collectively, these agents enable networks to autonomously interpret, reason over, adapt to, and act upon diverse intents and network conditions in a scalable manner.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01271v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Q-DiT4SR: Exploration of Detail-Preserving Diffusion Transformer Quantization for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01273</link><description>arXiv:2602.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged in Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) to generate high-quality textures, yet their heavy inference burden hinders real-world deployment. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for acceleration, existing methods in super-resolution mostly focus on U-Net architectures, whereas generic DiT quantization is typically designed for text-to-image tasks. Directly applying these methods to DiT-based super-resolution models leads to severe degradation of local textures. Therefore, we propose Q-DiT4SR, the first PTQ framework specifically tailored for DiT-based Real-ISR. We propose H-SVD, a hierarchical SVD that integrates a global low-rank branch with a local block-wise rank-1 branch under a matched parameter budget. We further propose Variance-aware Spatio-Temporal Mixed Precision: VaSMP allocates cross-layer weight bit-widths in a data-free manner based on rate-distortion theory, while VaTMP schedules intra-layer activation precision across diffusion timesteps via dynamic programming (DP) with minimal calibration. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our Q-DiT4SR achieves SOTA performance under both W4A6 and W4A4 settings. Notably, the W4A4 quantization configuration reduces model size by 5.8$\times$ and computational operations by over 60$\times$. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/xunzhang1128/Q-DiT4SR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PACER: Blockwise Pre-verification for Speculative Decoding with Adaptive Length</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01274</link><description>arXiv:2602.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a powerful technique for accelerating the inference process of large language models (LLMs) without sacrificing accuracy. Typically, SD employs a small draft model to generate a fixed number of draft tokens, which are then verified in parallel by the target model. However, our experiments reveal that the optimal draft length varies significantly across different decoding steps. This variation suggests that using a fixed draft length limits the potential for further improvements in decoding speed. To address this challenge, we propose Pacer, a novel approach that dynamically controls draft length using a lightweight, trainable pre-verification layer. This layer pre-verifies draft tokens blockwise before they are sent to the target model, allowing the draft model to stop token generation if the blockwise pre-verification fails. We implement Pacer on multiple SD model pairs and evaluate its performance across various benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that Pacer achieves up to 2.66x Speedup over autoregressive decoding and consistently outperforms standard speculative decoding. Furthermore, when integrated with Ouroboros, Pacer attains up to 3.09x Speedup.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01274v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Driven Ontology Construction for Enterprise Knowledge Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01276</link><description>arXiv:2602.01276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise Knowledge Graphs have become essential for unifying heterogeneous data and enforcing semantic governance.

This paper introduces OntoEKG, a LLM-driven pipeline designed to accelerate the generation of domain-specific ontologies from unstructured enterprise data. Our approach decomposes the modelling task into two distinct phases: an extraction module that identifies core classes and properties, and an entailment module that logically structures these elements into a hierarchy before serialising them into standard RDF. Addressing the significant lack of comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end ontology construction, we adopt a new evaluation dataset derived from documents across the Data, Finance, and Logistics sectors. Experimental results highlight both the potential and the challenges of this approach, achieving a fuzzy-match F1-score of 0.724 in the Data domain while revealing limitations in scope definition and hierarchical reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01276v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DSFC-Net: A Dual-Encoder Spatial and Frequency Co-Awareness Network for Rural Road Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01278</link><description>arXiv:2602.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate extraction of rural roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is essential for infrastructure planning and sustainable development. However, this task presents unique challenges in rural settings due to several factors. These include high intra-class variability and low inter-class separability from diverse surface materials, frequent vegetation occlusions that disrupt spatial continuity, and narrow road widths that exacerbate detection difficulties. Existing methods, primarily optimized for structured urban environments, often underperform in these scenarios as they overlook such distinctive characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose DSFC-Net, a dual-encoder framework that synergistically fuses spatial and frequency-domain information. Specifically, a CNN branch is employed to capture fine-grained local road boundaries and short-range continuity, while a novel Spatial-Frequency Hybrid Transformer (SFT) is introduced to robustly model global topological dependencies against vegetation occlusions. Distinct from standard attention mechanisms that suffer from frequency bias, the SFT incorporates a Cross-Frequency Interaction Attention (CFIA) module that explicitly decouples high- and low-frequency information via a Laplacian Pyramid strategy. This design enables the dynamic interaction between spatial details and frequency-aware global contexts, effectively preserving the connectivity of narrow roads. Furthermore, a Channel Feature Fusion Module (CFFM) is proposed to bridge the two branches by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise feature responses, seamlessly integrating local textures with global semantics for accurate segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on the WHU-RuR+, DeepGlobe, and Massachusetts datasets validate the superiority of DSFC-Net over state-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01278v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Richer Bayesian Last Layers with Subsampled NTK Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01279</link><description>arXiv:2602.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Last Layers (BLLs) provide a convenient and computationally efficient way to estimate uncertainty in neural networks. However, they underestimate epistemic uncertainty because they apply a Bayesian treatment only to the final layer, ignoring uncertainty induced by earlier layers. We propose a method that improves BLLs by leveraging a projection of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) features onto the space spanned by the last-layer features. This enables posterior inference that accounts for variability of the full network while retaining the low computational cost of inference of a standard BLL. We show that our method yields posterior variances that are provably greater or equal to those of a standard BLL, correcting its tendency to underestimate epistemic uncertainty. To further reduce computational cost, we introduce a uniform subsampling scheme for estimating the projection matrix and for posterior inference. We derive approximation bounds for both types of sub-sampling. Empirical evaluations on UCI regression, contextual bandits, image classification, and out-of-distribution detection tasks in image and tabular datasets, demonstrate improved calibration and uncertainty estimates compared to standard BLLs and competitive baselines, while reducing computational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01279v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Transfers Safety? Identifying and Targeting Cross-Lingual Shared Safety Neurons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01283</link><description>arXiv:2602.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual safety remains significantly imbalanced, leaving non-high-resource (NHR) languages vulnerable compared to robust high-resource (HR) ones. Moreover, the neural mechanisms driving safety alignment remain unclear despite observed cross-lingual representation transfer.
  In this paper, we find that LLMs contain a set of cross-lingual shared safety neurons (SS-Neurons), a remarkably small yet critical neuronal subset that jointly regulates safety behavior across languages.
  We first identify monolingual safety neurons (MS-Neurons) and validate their causal role in safety refusal behavior through targeted activation and suppression.
  Our cross-lingual analyses then identify SS-Neurons as the subset of MS-Neurons shared between HR and NHR languages, serving as a bridge to transfer safety capabilities from HR to NHR domains.
  We observe that suppressing these neurons causes concurrent safety drops across NHR languages, whereas reinforcing them improves cross-lingual defensive consistency.
  Building on these insights, we propose a simple neuron-oriented training strategy that targets SS-Neurons based on language resource distribution and model architecture. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning this tiny neuronal subset outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing NHR safety while maintaining the model's general capabilities.

Abstract: As deepfake videos become increasingly difficult for people to recognise, understanding the strategies humans use is key to designing effective media literacy interventions. We conducted a study with 195 participants between the ages of 21 and 40, who judged real and deepfake videos, rated their confidence, and reported the cues they relied on across visual, audio, and knowledge strategies. Participants were more accurate with real videos than with deepfakes and showed lower expected calibration error for real content. Through association rule mining, we identified cue combinations that shaped performance. Visual appearance, vocal, and intuition often co-occurred for successful identifications, which highlights the importance of multimodal approaches in human detection. Our findings show which cues help or hinder detection and suggest directions for designing media literacy tools that guide effective cue use. Building on these insights can help people improve their identification skills and become more resilient to deceptive digital media.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-LLM Adaptive Conformal Inference for Reliable LLM Responses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01285</link><description>arXiv:2602.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring factuality is essential for the safe use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as medicine and law. Conformal inference provides distribution-free guarantees, but existing approaches are either overly conservative, discarding many true-claims, or rely on adaptive error rates and simple linear models that fail to capture complex group structures. To address these challenges, we reformulate conformal inference in a multiplicative filtering setting, modeling factuality as a product of claim-level scores. Our method, Multi-LLM Adaptive Conformal Inference (MACI), leverages ensembles to produce more accurate factuality-scores, which in our experiments led to higher retention, while validity is preserved through group-conditional calibration. Experiments show that MACI consistently achieves user-specified coverage with substantially higher retention and lower time cost than baselines.

Abstract: Entropy-based confidence signals are increasingly leveraged to improve reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches treat confidence as a static quantity -- typically aggregated over tokens. We show that the \emph{temporal evolution} of confidence during generation carries richer information than aggregate statistics alone. Analyzing token-level entropy trajectories, we identify characteristic patterns distinguishing correct from incorrect reasoning: erroneous solutions exhibit unstable dynamics, including burst spikes (sustained uncertainty growth) and peak-valley spikes (sharp rebounds following transient confidence). These patterns persist across models and training stages, suggesting they reflect intrinsic properties of reasoning failure rather than superficial noise. To formalize this observation, we introduce the Entropy Dynamics Instability Score (\textbf{EDIS}), a trajectory-level metric quantifying instability in entropy evolution. EDIS serves as an effective diagnostic signal for inference-time selection, substantially improving reasoning accuracy, and offers a promising direction for training-time sample curation. Our findings establish entropy dynamics as an underexplored yet informative lens for understanding and improving LLM reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01288v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gradient-Aligned Calibration for Post-Training Quantization of Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01289</link><description>arXiv:2602.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis by progressively estimating a smooth transition from a Gaussian distribution of noise to a real image. Unfortunately, their practical deployment is limited by slow inference speed, high memory usage, and the computational demands of the noise estimation process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution to accelerate sampling and reduce memory overhead for diffusion models. Existing PTQ methods for diffusion models typically apply uniform weights to calibration samples across timesteps, which is sub-optimal since data at different timesteps may contribute differently to the diffusion process. Additionally, due to varying activation distributions and gradients across timesteps, a uniform quantization approach is sub-optimal. Each timestep requires a different gradient direction for optimal quantization, and treating them equally can lead to conflicting gradients that degrade performance. In this paper, we propose a novel PTQ method that addresses these challenges by assigning appropriate weights to calibration samples. Specifically, our approach learns to assign optimal weights to calibration samples to align the quantized model's gradients across timesteps, facilitating the quantization process. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedrooms, and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other PTQ methods for diffusion models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01289v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AOASS: Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Square Spiral Framework for Single-mobile Anchor-Based WSN Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01290</link><description>arXiv:2602.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and energy efficient localization remains a key challenge in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), particularly when obstacles affect signal propagation. This study introduces AOASS (Adaptive Obstacle Aware Square Spiral), a new single mobile anchor framework that combines an optimized square spiral movement pattern with adaptive obstacle detection. The mobile anchor can sense and bypass obstacles while maintaining high localization accuracy and full network coverage, ensuring that each node receives at least three noncollinear beacon signals for reliable position estimation. Localization accuracy is further improved using the OLSTM DV Hop model, which integrates a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with the traditional DV Hop algorithm to estimate hop distances better and reduce multi hop errors. The anchor trajectory is managed by a TD3 LSTM reinforcement learning agent, supported by a Kalman based prediction layer and a fuzzy logic ORCA safety module for smooth and collision free navigation. Simulation experiments across different obstacle densities show that AOASS consistently achieves higher localization accuracy, better energy efficiency, and more optimized trajectories than existing approaches. These results demonstrate the framework scalability and potential for real world WSN applications, offering an intelligent and adaptable solution for data driven IoT systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01290v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Construction-Verification: A Benchmark for Applied Mathematics in Lean 4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01291</link><description>arXiv:2602.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in mathematical formalization. However, existing benchmarks focus on logical verification of declarative propositions, often neglecting the task of explicitly synthesizing solutions. This limitation is particularly acute in applied mathematics domains, where the goal is frequently to derive concrete values or executable algorithms rather than solely proving theorems. To address this, we introduce a Lean 4 framework that enforces a construction-verification workflow, compelling the agent to define explicit solutions before proving their correctness. We curate a comprehensive benchmark AMBER (Applied Mathematics BEnchmark for Reasoning) spanning core domains of applied mathematics, including convex analysis, optimization, numerical algebra, and high-dimensional probability. Aside from theorem proving, our benchmark features complex tasks such as evaluation, algorithm design, and representation transformation. Experiments reveal that current models face significant difficulties with these constructive tasks. Notably, we observe that general-purpose reasoning models consistently outperform specialized theorem provers. We attribute this to a degradation of instruction following capabilities in specialized models. Fine-tuning on proof corpora appears to induce ``tactical overfitting", compromising the ability to adhere to complex constructive requirements, whereas general models retain the versatility needed for multi-task formal reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01291v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Heuristic Neuromorphic Solver for the Edge User Allocation Problem with Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01294</link><description>arXiv:2602.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic solver for the NP-hard Edge User Allocation problem using an attractor network with Winner-Takes-All (WTA) mechanism implemented with the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) framework. Unlike previous energy-based attractor networks, our solver uses dynamic heuristic biasing to guide allocations in real time and introduces a "no allocation" state to each WTA motif, achieving near-optimal performance with an empirically upper-bounded number of time steps. The approach is compatible with neuromorphic architectures and may offer improvements in energy efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01294v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The BoBW Algorithms for Heavy-Tailed MDPs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01295</link><description>arXiv:2602.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate episodic Markov Decision Processes with heavy-tailed feedback (HTMDPs). Existing approaches for HTMDPs are conservative in stochastic environments and lack adaptivity in adversarial regimes. In this work, we propose algorithms ```HT-FTRL-OM``` and ```HT-FTRL-UOB``` for HTMDPs that achieve Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) guarantees: instance-independent regret in adversarial environments and logarithmic instance-dependent regret in self-bounding (including the stochastic case) environments. For the known transition setting, ```HT-FTRL-OM``` applies the Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework over occupancy measures with novel skipping loss estimators, achieving a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{1/\alpha})$ regret bound in adversarial regimes and a $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret in stochastic regimes. Building upon this framework, we develop a novel algorithm ```HT-FTRL-UOB``` to tackle the more challenging unknown-transition setting. This algorithm employs a pessimistic skipping loss estimator and achieves a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{1/\alpha} + \sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial regimes and a $\mathcal{O}(\log^2(T))$ regret in stochastic regimes. Our analysis overcomes key barriers through several technical insights, including a local control mechanism for heavy-tailed shifted losses, a new suboptimal-mass propagation principle, and a novel regret decomposition that isolates transition uncertainty from heavy-tailed estimation errors and skipping bias.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RE-MCDF: Closed-Loop Multi-Expert LLM Reasoning for Knowledge-Grounded Clinical Diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01297</link><description>arXiv:2602.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic medical records (EMRs), particularly in neurology, are inherently heterogeneous, sparse, and noisy, which poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) in clinical diagnosis. In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency. Extensive experiments on the neurology subset of CMEMR (NEEMRs) and on our curated dataset (XMEMRs) demonstrate that RE-MCDF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in complex diagnostic scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01297v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interaction-Consistent Object Removal via MLLM-Based Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01298</link><description>arXiv:2602.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-based object removal often erases only the named target, leaving behind interaction evidence that renders the result semantically inconsistent. We formalize this problem as Interaction-Consistent Object Removal (ICOR), which requires removing not only the target object but also associated interaction elements, such as lighting-dependent effects, physically connected objects, targetproduced elements, and contextually linked objects. To address this task, we propose Reasoning-Enhanced Object Removal with MLLM (REORM), a reasoningenhanced object removal framework that leverages multimodal large language models to infer which elements must be jointly removed. REORM features a modular design that integrates MLLM-driven analysis, mask-guided removal, and a self-correction mechanism, along with a local-deployment variant that supports accurate editing under limited resources. To support evaluation, we introduce ICOREval, a benchmark consisting of instruction-driven removals with rich interaction dependencies. On ICOREval, REORM outperforms state-of-the-art image editing systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing interactionconsistent results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01298v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Making progress: Reducibility Candidates and Cut Elimination in the Ill-founded Realm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01299</link><description>arXiv:2602.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ill-founded (or non-wellfounded) proof systems have emerged as a natural framework for inductive and coinductive reasoning. In such systems, soundness relies on global correctness criteria, such as the progressivity condition. Ensuring that these criteria are preserved under infinitary cut elimination remains a central technical challenge in ill-founded proof theory.
  In this paper, we present two cut elimination arguments for ill-founded $\mu \mathsf{MALL}$ - a fragment of linear logic extended with fixed-points - based on the reducibility candidates technique of Tait and Girard. In both arguments, preservation of progressivity follows directly from the defining properties of the reducibility candidates. In particular, the second argument is based on the topological notion of internally closed set developed in previous work by Leigh and Afshari.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01299v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A survey of scalar and vector extrapolation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01301</link><description>arXiv:2602.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar extrapolation and convergence acceleration methods are central tools in numerical analysis for improving the efficiency of iterative algorithms and the summation of slowly convergent series. These methods construct transformed sequences that converge more rapidly to the same limit without altering the underlying iterative process, thereby reducing computational cost and enhancing numerical accuracy. Historically, the origins of such techniques can be traced back to classical algebraic methods by AlKhwarizmi and early series acceleration techniques by Newton, while systematic approaches emerged in the 20th century with Aitken process and Richardson extrapolation. Later developments, including the Shanks transformation and Wynn epsilon algorithm, provided general frameworks capable of eliminating multiple dominant error components, with deep connections to Pade approximants and rational approximations of generating functions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of classical scalar extrapolation methods, including Richardson extrapolation, Aitken process, Shanks transformation, Wynn epsilon algorithm, and other algorithms. We examine their theoretical foundations, asymptotic error models, convergence properties, numerical stability, and practical implementation considerations. The second part of this work is dedicated to vector extrapolation methods: polynomial based ones and epsilon algorithm generalizations to vector sequences. Additionally, we highlight modern developments such as their applications to iterative solvers, Krylov subspace methods, and large-scale computational simulations. The aim of this review is to provide a unified perspective on scalar and vector extrapolation techniques, bridging historical origins, theoretical insights, and contemporary computational applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReDiStory: Region-Disentangled Diffusion for Consistent Visual Story Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01303</link><description>arXiv:2602.01303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating coherent visual stories requires maintaining subject identity across multiple images while preserving frame-specific semantics. Recent training-free methods concatenate identity and frame prompts into a unified representation, but this often introduces inter-frame semantic interference that weakens identity preservation in complex stories. We propose ReDiStory, a training-free framework that improves multi-frame story generation via inference-time prompt embedding reorganization. ReDiStory explicitly decomposes text embeddings into identity-related and frame-specific components, then decorrelates frame embeddings by suppressing shared directions across frames. This reduces cross-frame interference without modifying diffusion parameters or requiring additional supervision. Under identical diffusion backbones and inference settings, ReDiStory improves identity consistency while maintaining prompt fidelity. Experiments on the ConsiStory+ benchmark show consistent gains over 1Prompt1Story on multiple identity consistency metrics.

Abstract: We often assume that agent-to-agent interaction will mirror human conversation. However, agents operate fundamentally differently. What if they could develop communication patterns that are more efficient and better aligned with their capabilities? While cryptographic primitives that could profoundly improve everyday interactions already exist, humans can't use them because they are too complex and the math can't be done in one's head. Examples range from proving your age (or other attributes) without showing your ID, to filing an anonymous report within a group while proving you are a legitimate member, to splitting a dinner bill fairly without revealing salaries. What if agents could create protocols "on the fly" by recognizing which primitive fits an everyday situation, proposing it to an agentic counterpart, persuading them to participate, and then executing the protocol correctly using appropriate computation tools? Protocol Agent frames this problem by introducing a benchmark that spans: (1) cryptographic primitive recognition, (2) negotiation skills, (3) implementation correctness, (4) correct computation and (5) security strength. We evaluate current open-weight and state-of-the-art models on this benchmark, propose a dataset-generation approach to improve these capabilities, and measure the impact of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on benchmark performance, with tuned models outperforming base models by a wide margin.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01304v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StoryState: Agent-Based State Control for Consistent and Editable Storybooks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01305</link><description>arXiv:2602.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal models have enabled one-click storybook generation, where users provide a short description and receive a multi-page illustrated story. However, the underlying story state, such as characters, world settings, and page-level objects, remains implicit, making edits coarse-grained and often breaking visual consistency. We present StoryState, an agent-based orchestration layer that introduces an explicit and editable story state on top of training-free text-to-image generation. StoryState represents each story as a structured object composed of a character sheet, global settings, and per-page scene constraints, and employs a small set of LLM agents to maintain this state and derive 1Prompt1Story-style prompts for generation and editing. Operating purely through prompts, StoryState is model-agnostic and compatible with diverse generation backends. System-level experiments on multi-page editing tasks show that StoryState enables localized page edits, improves cross-page consistency, and reduces unintended changes, interaction turns, and editing time compared to 1Prompt1Story, while approaching the one-shot consistency of Gemini Storybook.

Abstract: Maintaining visual and semantic consistency across frames is a key challenge in text-to-image storytelling. Existing training-free methods, such as One-Prompt-One-Story, concatenate all prompts into a single sequence, which often induces strong embedding correlation and leads to color leakage, background blending, and identity drift. We propose DeCorStory, a training-free inference-time framework that explicitly reduces inter-frame semantic interference. DeCorStory applies Gram-Schmidt prompt embedding decorrelation to orthogonalize frame-level semantics, followed by singular value reweighting to strengthen prompt-specific information and identity-preserving cross-attention to stabilize character identity during diffusion. The method requires no model modification or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into existing diffusion pipelines. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in prompt-image alignment, identity consistency, and visual diversity, achieving state-of-the-art performance among training-free baselines.

Abstract: This work investigates the optimization instability of deep neural networks from a less-explored yet insightful perspective: the emergence and amplification of singularities in the parametric space. Our analysis reveals that parametric singularities inevitably grow with gradient updates and further intensify alignment with representations, leading to increased singularities in the representation space. We show that the gradient Frobenius norms are bounded by the top singular values of the weight matrices, and as training progresses, the mutually reinforcing growth of weight and representation singularities, termed the curse of singularities, relaxes these bounds, escalating the risk of sharp loss explosions. To counter this, we propose Parametric Singularity Smoothing (PSS), a lightweight, flexible, and effective method for smoothing the singular spectra of weight matrices. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, architectures, and optimizers demonstrate that PSS mitigates instability, restores trainability even after failure, and improves both training efficiency and generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01308v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Workflow Automation Efficiency Using n8n: A Small-Scale Business Case Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01311</link><description>arXiv:2602.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Workflow automation has become increasingly accessible through low-code platforms, enabling small organizations and individuals to improve operational efficiency without extensive software development expertise. This study evaluates the performance impact of workflow automation using n8n through a small-scale business case study. A representative lead-processing workflow was implemented to automatically store data, send email confirmations, and generate real-time notifications. Experimental benchmarking was conducted by comparing 20 manual executions with 25 automated executions under controlled conditions. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the average execution time from 185.35 seconds (manual) to 1.23 seconds (automated), corresponding to an approximately 151 times reduction in execution time. Additionally, manual execution exhibited an error rate of 5%, while automated execution achieved zero observed errors. The findings highlight the effectiveness of low-code automation in improving efficiency, reliability, and operational consistency for small-scale workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Imperfect Influence, Preserved Rankings: A Theory of TRAK for Data Attribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01312</link><description>arXiv:2602.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data attribution, tracing a model's prediction back to specific training data, is an important tool for interpreting sophisticated AI models. The widely used TRAK algorithm addresses this challenge by first approximating the underlying model with a kernel machine and then leveraging techniques developed for approximating the leave-one-out (ALO) risk. Despite its strong empirical performance, the theoretical conditions under which the TRAK approximations are accurate as well as the regimes in which they break down remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of the TRAK algorithm, characterizing its performance and quantifying the errors introduced by the approximations on which the method relies. We show that although the approximations incur significant errors, TRAK's estimated influence remains highly correlated with the original influence and therefore largely preserves the relative ranking of data points. We corroborate our theoretical results through extensive simulations and empirical studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01312v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EverMemBench: Benchmarking Long-Term Interactive Memory in Large Language ModelsEverMemBench: Benchmarking Long-Term Interactive Memory in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01313</link><description>arXiv:2602.01313v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has turned blockchains into financial infrastructure, allowing anyone to trade, lend, and build protocols without intermediaries, but this openness exposes pools of value controlled by code. Within five years, the DeFi ecosystem has lost over 15.75B USD to reported exploits. Many exploits arise from permissionless opportunities that any participant can trigger using only public state and standard interfaces, which we call Anyone-Can-Take (ACT) opportunities. Despite on-chain transparency, postmortem analysis remains slow and manual: investigations start from limited evidence, sometimes only a single transaction hash, and must reconstruct the exploit lifecycle by recovering related transactions, contract code, and state dependencies.
  We present TxRay, a Large Language Model (LLM) agentic postmortem system that uses tool calls to reconstruct live ACT attacks from limited evidence. Starting from one or more seed transactions, TxRay recovers the exploit lifecycle, derives an evidence-backed root cause, and generates a runnable, self-contained Proof of Concept (PoC) that deterministically reproduces the incident. TxRay self-checks postmortems by encoding incident-specific semantic oracles as executable assertions.
  To evaluate PoC correctness and quality, we develop PoCEvaluator, an independent agentic execution-and-review evaluator. On 114 incidents from DeFiHackLabs, TxRay produces an expert-aligned root cause and an executable PoC for 105 incidents, achieving 92.11% end-to-end reproduction. Under PoCEvaluator, 98.1% of TxRay PoCs avoid hard-coding attacker addresses, a +24.8pp lift over DeFiHackLabs. In a live deployment, TxRay delivers validated root causes in 40 minutes and PoCs in 59 minutes at median latency. TxRay's oracle-validated PoCs enable attack imitation, improving coverage by 15.6% and 65.5% over STING and APE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01317v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PolySAE: Modeling Feature Interactions in Sparse Autoencoders via Polynomial Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01322</link><description>arXiv:2602.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method for interpreting neural network representations by decomposing activations into sparse combinations of dictionary atoms. However, SAEs assume that features combine additively through linear reconstruction, an assumption that cannot capture compositional structure: linear models cannot distinguish whether "Starbucks" arises from the composition of "star" and "coffee" features or merely their co-occurrence. This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on a shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 2-10$\times$ larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions. Critically, learned interaction weights exhibit negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency ($r = 0.06$ vs. $r = 0.82$ for SAE feature covariance), suggesting that polynomial terms capture compositional structure, such as morphological binding and phrasal composition, largely independent of surface statistics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01322v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DreamOn: Diffusion Language Models For Code Infilling Beyond Fixed-size Canvas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01326</link><description>arXiv:2602.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) present a compelling alternative to autoregressive models, offering flexible, any-order infilling without specialized prompting design. However, their practical utility is blocked by a critical limitation: the requirement of a fixed-length masked sequence for generation. This constraint severely degrades code infilling performance when the predefined mask size mismatches the ideal completion length. To address this, we propose DreamOn, a novel diffusion framework that enables dynamic, variable-length generation. DreamOn augments the diffusion process with two length control states, allowing the model to autonomously expand or contract the output length based solely on its own predictions. We integrate this mechanism into existing DLMs with minimal modifications to the training objective and no architectural changes. Built upon Dream-Coder-7B and DiffuCoder-7B, DreamOn achieves infilling performance on par with state-of-the-art autoregressive models on HumanEval-Infilling and SantaCoder-FIM and matches oracle performance achieved with ground-truth length.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has recently emerged as a powerful approach for high-quality visual generation. However, their prohibitively slow inference due to a large number of denoising steps limits their potential use in real-time or interactive applications. Existing acceleration methods, like distillation, truncation, or consistency training, either degrade quality, incur costly retraining, or lack generalization. We propose FlowCast, a training-free speculative generation framework that accelerates inference by exploiting the fact that FM models are trained to preserve constant velocity. FlowCast speculates future velocity by extrapolating current velocity without incurring additional time cost, and accepts it if it is within a mean-squared error threshold. This constant-velocity forecasting allows redundant steps in stable regions to be aggressively skipped while retaining precision in complex ones. FlowCast is a plug-and-play framework that integrates seamlessly with any FM model and requires no auxiliary networks. We also present a theoretical analysis and bound the worst-case deviation between speculative and full FM trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FlowCast achieves $&gt;2.5\times$ speedup in image generation, video generation, and editing tasks, outperforming existing baselines with no quality loss as compared to standard full generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A-MapReduce: Executing Wide Search via Agentic MapReduce</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01331</link><description>arXiv:2602.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems exhibit systematic advantages in deep research tasks, which emphasize iterative, vertically structured information seeking. However, when confronted with wide search tasks characterized by large-scale, breadth-oriented retrieval, existing agentic frameworks, primarily designed around sequential, vertically structured reasoning, remain stuck in expansive search objectives and inefficient long-horizon execution. To bridge this gap, we propose A-MapReduce, a MapReduce paradigm-inspired multi-agent execution framework that recasts wide search as a horizontally structured retrieval problem. Concretely, A-MapReduce implements parallel processing of massive retrieval targets through task-adaptive decomposition and structured result aggregation. Meanwhile, it leverages experiential memory to drive the continual evolution of query-conditioned task allocation and recomposition, enabling progressive improvement in large-scale wide-search regimes. Extensive experiments on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that A-MapReduce is (i) high-performing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on WideSearch and DeepWideSearch, and delivering 5.11% - 17.50% average Item F1 improvements compared with strong baselines with OpenAI o3 or Gemini 2.5 Pro backbones; (ii) cost-effective and efficient, delivering superior cost-performance trade-offs and reducing running time by 45.8\% compared to representative multi-agent baselines.

Abstract: Vision tool-use reinforcement learning (RL) can equip vision-language models with visual operators such as crop-and-zoom and achieves strong performance gains, yet it remains unclear whether these gains are driven by improvements in tool use or evolving intrinsic capabilities.We introduce MED (Measure-Explain-Diagnose), a coarse-to-fine framework that disentangles intrinsic capability changes from tool-induced effects, decomposes the tool-induced performance difference into gain and harm terms, and probes the mechanisms driving their evolution. Across checkpoint-level analyses on two VLMs with different tool priors and six benchmarks, we find that improvements are dominated by intrinsic learning, while tool-use RL mainly reduces tool-induced harm (e.g., fewer call-induced errors and weaker tool schema interference) and yields limited progress in tool-based correction of intrinsic failures. Overall, current vision tool-use RL learns to coexist safely with tools rather than master them.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Pixels: Visual Metaphor Transfer via Schema-Driven Agentic Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01335</link><description>arXiv:2602.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A visual metaphor constitutes a high-order form of human creativity, employing cross-domain semantic fusion to transform abstract concepts into impactful visual rhetoric. Despite the remarkable progress of generative AI, existing models remain largely confined to pixel-level instruction alignment and surface-level appearance preservation, failing to capture the underlying abstract logic necessary for genuine metaphorical generation. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of Visual Metaphor Transfer (VMT), which challenges models to autonomously decouple the "creative essence" from a reference image and re-materialize that abstract logic onto a user-specified target subject. We propose a cognitive-inspired, multi-agent framework that operationalizes Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) through a novel Schema Grammar ("G"). This structured representation decouples relational invariants from specific visual entities, providing a rigorous foundation for cross-domain logic re-instantiation. Our pipeline executes VMT through a collaborative system of specialized agents: a perception agent that distills the reference into a schema, a transfer agent that maintains generic space invariance to discover apt carriers, a generation agent for high-fidelity synthesis and a hierarchical diagnostic agent that mimics a professional critic, performing closed-loop backtracking to identify and rectify errors across abstract logic, component selection, and prompt encoding. Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA baselines in metaphor consistency, analogy appropriateness, and visual creativity, paving the way for automated high-impact creative applications in advertising and media.

Abstract: We present algorithms for diffusion model sampling which obtain $\delta$-error in $\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta)$ steps, given access to $\widetilde O(\delta)$-accurate score estimates in $L^2$. This is an exponential improvement over all previous results. Specifically, under minimal data assumptions, the complexity is $\widetilde O(d\,\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta))$ where $d$ is the dimension of the data; under a non-uniform $L$-Lipschitz condition, the complexity is $\widetilde O(\sqrt{dL}\,\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta))$; and if the data distribution has intrinsic dimension $d_\star$, then the complexity reduces to $\widetilde O(d_\star\,\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta))$. Our approach also yields the first $\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta)$ complexity sampler for general log-concave distributions using only gradient evaluations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01338v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finding Differentially Private Second Order Stationary Points in Stochastic Minimax Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01339</link><description>arXiv:2602.01339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first study of the problem of finding differentially private (DP) second-order stationary points (SOSP) in stochastic (non-convex) minimax optimization. Existing literature either focuses only on first-order stationary points for minimax problems or on SOSP for classical stochastic minimization problems. This work provides, for the first time, a unified and detailed treatment of both empirical and population risks. Specifically, we propose a purely first-order method that combines a nested gradient descent--ascent scheme with SPIDER-style variance reduction and Gaussian perturbations to ensure privacy. A key technical device is a block-wise ($q$-period) analysis that controls the accumulation of stochastic variance and privacy noise without summing over the full iteration horizon, yielding a unified treatment of both empirical-risk and population formulations. Under standard smoothness, Hessian-Lipschitzness, and strong concavity assumptions, we establish high-probability guarantees for reaching an $(\alpha,\sqrt{\rho_\Phi \alpha})$-approximate second-order stationary point with $\alpha = \mathcal{O}( (\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3})$ for empirical risk objectives and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}} + (\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon})^{1/2})$ for population objectives, matching the best known rates for private first-order stationarity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01339v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MTC-VAE: Multi-Level Temporal Compression with Content Awareness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01340</link><description>arXiv:2602.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) rely on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to compress videos into compact latent representations. For continuous Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), achieving higher compression rates is desirable; yet, the efficiency notably declines when extra sampling layers are added without expanding the dimensions of hidden channels. In this paper, we present a technique to convert fixed compression rate VAEs into models that support multi-level temporal compression, providing a straightforward and minimal fine-tuning approach to counteract performance decline at elevated compression rates.Moreover, we examine how varying compression levels impact model performance over video segments with diverse characteristics, offering empirical evidence on the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We also investigate the integration of our multi-level temporal compression VAE with diffusion-based generative models, DiT, highlighting successful concurrent training and compatibility within these frameworks. This investigation illustrates the potential uses of multi-level temporal compression.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01340v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privocracy: Online Democracy through Private Voting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01341</link><description>arXiv:2602.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional access control policies, every access granted and administrative account introduces an additional vulnerability, as a corruption of a high-privilege user can compromise several sensitive files. Privocracy is an access control mechanism that minimizes the need to attribute high privileges by triggering a secure e-voting procedure to run commands that require using sensitive resources. With Privocracy an organization can distribute trust in resource access, minimizing the system vulnerabilities from single points of failure, all while maintaining the high flexibility of discretionary access control policies.
  The Privocracy voting mechanism achieves everlasting privacy, ensuring votes remain confidential regardless of an adversary's computational power, while addressing the dependability requirements of a practical and secure system. The procedure incorporates useful features such as vote delegation to reduce voter fatigue, rapid voting rounds to enable quick action during emergencies, and selective vote auditing for application-level accountability. Our experimental results demonstrate that Privocracy processes votes efficiently and can be deployed on commodity hardware.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01341v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Visual Autoregressive Acceleration via Dual-Linkage Entropy Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01345</link><description>arXiv:2602.01345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) suffers from substantial computational cost due to the massive token count involved. Failing to account for the continuous evolution of modeling dynamics, existing VAR token reduction methods face three key limitations: heuristic stage partition, non-adaptive schedules, and limited acceleration scope, thereby leaving significant acceleration potential untapped. Since entropy variation intrinsically reflects the transition of predictive uncertainty, it offers a principled measure to capture modeling dynamics evolution. Therefore, we propose NOVA, a training-free token reduction acceleration framework for VAR models via entropy analysis. NOVA adaptively determines the acceleration activation scale during inference by online identifying the inflection point of scale entropy growth. Through scale-linkage and layer-linkage ratio adjustment, NOVA dynamically computes distinct token reduction ratios for each scale and layer, pruning low-entropy tokens while reusing the cache derived from the residuals at the prior scale to accelerate inference and maintain generation quality. Extensive experiments and analyses validate NOVA as a simple yet effective training-free acceleration framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01345v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Model Specific Task Similarity for Vision Language Model Selection via Layer Conductance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01346</link><description>arXiv:2602.01346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While open sourced Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have proliferated, selecting the optimal pretrained model for a specific downstream task remains challenging. Exhaustive evaluation is often infeasible due to computational constraints and data limitations in few shot scenarios. Existing selection methods fail to fully address this: they either rely on data-intensive proxies or use symmetric textual descriptors that neglect the inherently directional and model-specific nature of transferability. To address this problem, we propose a framework that grounds model selection in the internal functional dynamics of the visual encoder. Our approach represents each task via layer wise conductance and derives a target-conditioned block importance distribution through entropy regularized alignment. Building on this, we introduce Directional Conductance Divergence (DCD), an asymmetric metric that quantifies how effectively a source task covers the target's salient functional blocks. This allows for predicting target model rankings by aggregating source task ranks without direct inference. Experimental results on 48 VLMs across 21 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 14.7% improvement in NDCG@5 over SWAB.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CRAFT: Calibrated Reasoning with Answer-Faithful Traces via Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01348</link><description>arXiv:2602.01348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely used to ground Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-hop question answering. Recent work mainly focused on improving answer accuracy via fine-tuning and structured or reinforcement-based optimization. However, reliable reasoning in response generation faces three challenges: 1) Reasoning Collapse. Reasoning in multi-hop QA is inherently complex due to multi-hop composition and is further destabilized by noisy retrieval. 2) Reasoning-answer inconsistency. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty of LLM generation and exposure to evidence--distractor mixtures, models may produce correct answers that are not faithfully supported by their intermediate reasoning or evidence. 3) Loss of format control. Traditional chain-of-thought generation often deviates from required structured output formats, leading to incomplete or malformed structured content. To address these challenges, we propose CRAFT (Calibrated Reasoning with Answer-Faithful Traces), a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning framework that trains models to perform faithful reasoning during response generation. CRAFT employs dual reward mechanisms to optimize multi-hop reasoning: deterministic rewards ensure structural correctness while judge-based rewards verify semantic faithfulness. This optimization framework supports controllable trace variants that enable systematic analysis of how structure and scale affect reasoning performance and faithfulness. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks show that CRAFT improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across model scales, with the CRAFT 7B model achieving competitive performance with closed-source LLMs across multiple reasoning trace settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01348v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepPM: A Deep Learning-based Profit Maximization Approach in Social Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01351</link><description>arXiv:2602.01351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of Profit Maximization asks to choose a limited number of influential users from a given social network such that the initial activation of these users maximizes the profit earned at the end of the diffusion process. This problem has a direct impact on viral marketing in social networks. Over the past decade, several traditional methodologies (i.e., non-learning-based, which include approximate solution, heuristic solution, etc.) have been developed, and many of them produce promising results. All these methods require the information diffusion model as input. However, it may not be realistic to consider any particular diffusion model as real-world diffusion scenarios will be much more complex and need not follow the rules for any particular diffusion model. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework to solve the profit maximization problem. Our model makes a latent representation of the seed sets and is able to learn the diversified information diffusion pattern. We also design a noble objective function that can be optimized effectively using the proposed learning-based approach. The proposed model has been evaluated with the real-world datasets, and the results are reported. We compare the effectiveness of the proposed approach with many existing methods and observe that the seed set chosen by the proposed learning-based approach leads to more profit compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, which converts motion language descriptions into coherent 3D human motion sequences, has attracted increasing attention in fields, such as avatar animation and humanoid robotic interaction. Though existing models have achieved significant fidelity, they still suffer from two core limitations: (i) They treat motion periodicity and keyframe saliency as independent factors, overlooking their coupling and causing generation drift in long sequences. (ii) They are fragile to semantically equivalent paraphrases, where minor synonym substitutions distort textual embeddings, propagating through the decoder and producing unstable or erroneous motions. In this work, we propose T2M Mamba to address these limitations by (i) proposing Periodicity-Saliency Aware Mamba, which utilizes novel algorithms for keyframe weight estimation via enhanced Density Peaks Clustering and motion periodicity estimation via FFT-accelerated autocorrelation to capture coupled dynamics with minimal computational overhead, and (ii) constructing a Periodic Differential Cross-modal Alignment Module (PDCAM) to enhance robust alignment of textual and motion embeddings. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets have been conducted, confirming the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an FID of 0.068 and consistent gains on all other metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aggregation Queries over Unstructured Text: Benchmark and Agentic Method</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01355</link><description>arXiv:2602.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregation query over free text is a long-standing yet underexplored problem. Unlike ordinary question answering, aggregate queries require exhaustive evidence collection and systems are required to "find all," not merely "find one." Existing paradigms such as Text-to-SQL and Retrieval-Augmented Generation fail to achieve this completeness. In this work, we formalize entity-level aggregation querying over text in a corpus-bounded setting with strict completeness requirement. To enable principled evaluation, we introduce AGGBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate completeness-oriented aggregation under realistic large-scale corpus. To accompany the benchmark, we propose DFA (Disambiguation--Filtering--Aggregation), a modular agentic baseline that decomposes aggregation querying into interpretable stages and exposes key failure modes related to ambiguity, filtering, and aggregation. Empirical results show that DFA consistently improves aggregation evidence coverage over strong RAG and agentic baselines.

Abstract: Self-play post-training methods has emerged as an effective approach for finetuning large language models and turn the weak language model into strong language model without preference data. However, the theoretical foundations for self-play finetuning remain underexplored. In this work, we tackle this by connecting self-play finetuning with adversarial imitation learning by formulating finetuning procedure as a min-max game between the model and a regularized implicit reward player parameterized by the model itself. This perspective unifies self-play imitation and general preference alignment within a common framework. Under this formulation, we present a game-theoretic analysis showing that the self-play finetuning will converge to it's equilibrium. Guided by this theoretical formulation, we propose a new self-play imitation finetuning algorithm based on the $\chi^2$-divergence variational objective with bounded rewards and improved stability. Experiments on various of language model finetuning tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over existing self-play methods and validate our theoretical insights.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01357v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PaAno: Patch-Based Representation Learning for Time-Series Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01359</link><description>arXiv:2602.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent studies on time-series anomaly detection have increasingly adopted ever-larger neural network architectures such as transformers and foundation models, they incur high computational costs and memory usage, making them impractical for real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Moreover, they often fail to demonstrate significant performance gains over simpler methods under rigorous evaluation protocols. In this study, we propose Patch-based representation learning for time-series Anomaly detection (PaAno), a lightweight yet effective method for fast and efficient time-series anomaly detection. PaAno extracts short temporal patches from time-series training data and uses a 1D convolutional neural network to embed each patch into a vector representation. The model is trained using a combination of triplet loss and pretext loss to ensure the embeddings capture informative temporal patterns from input patches. During inference, the anomaly score at each time step is computed by comparing the embeddings of its surrounding patches to those of normal patches extracted from the training time-series. Evaluated on the TSB-AD benchmark, PaAno achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods, including those based on heavy architectures, on both univariate and multivariate time-series anomaly detection across various range-wise and point-wise performance measures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Balancing Understanding and Generation in Discrete Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01362</link><description>arXiv:2602.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In discrete generative modeling, two dominant paradigms demonstrate divergent capabilities: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLM) excel at semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, whereas Uniform-noise Diffusion Language Models (UDLM) achieve strong few-step generation quality, yet neither attains balanced performance across both dimensions. To address this, we propose XDLM, which bridges the two paradigms via a stationary noise kernel. XDLM offers two key contributions: (1) it provides a principled theoretical unification of MDLM and UDLM, recovering each paradigm as a special case; and (2) an alleviated memory bottleneck enabled by an algebraic simplification of the posterior probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that XDLM advances the Pareto frontier between understanding capability and generation quality. Quantitatively, XDLM surpasses UDLM by 5.4 points on zero-shot text benchmarks and outperforms MDLM in few-step image generation (FID 54.1 vs. 80.8). When scaled to tune an 8B-parameter large language model, XDLM achieves 15.0 MBPP in just 32 steps, effectively doubling the baseline performance. Finally, analysis of training dynamics reveals XDLM's superior potential for long-term scaling.

Abstract: Self-supervised speaker embeddings are widely used in speaker verification systems, but prior work has shown that they often encode sensitive demographic attributes, raising fairness and privacy concerns. This paper investigates the extent to which demographic information, specifically gender, age, and accent, is present in SimCLR-trained speaker embeddings and whether such leakage can be mitigated without severely degrading speaker verification performance. We study two debiasing strategies: adversarial training through gradient reversal and a causal bottleneck architecture that explicitly separates demographic and residual information. Demographic leakage is quantified using both linear and nonlinear probing classifiers, while speaker verification performance is evaluated using ROC-AUC and EER. Our results show that gender information is strongly and linearly encoded in baseline embeddings, whereas age and accent are weaker and primarily nonlinearly represented. Adversarial debiasing reduces gender leakage but has limited effect on age and accent and introduces a clear trade-off with verification accuracy. The causal bottleneck further suppresses demographic information, particularly in the residual representation, but incurs substantial performance degradation. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in mitigating demographic leakage in self-supervised speaker embeddings and clarify the trade-offs inherent in current debiasing approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01363v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Domains Interact: Asymmetric and Order-Sensitive Cross-Domain Effects in Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01365</link><description>arXiv:2602.01365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has become a key technique for improving reasoning abilities in large language models, yet its behavior under different domain sequencing strategies is poorly understood. In particular, the impact of sequential (one domain at a time) versus mixed-domain (multiple domain at a time) training in GRPO has not been systematically studied. We provide the first systematic analysis of training-order effects across math, science, logic, and puzzle reasoning tasks. We found (1) single-domain generalization is highly asymmetric: training on other domains improves math reasoning by approximately 25\% accuracy, while yielding negligible transfer to logic and puzzle; (2) cross-domain interactions are highly order-dependent: training in the order math$\rightarrow$science achieves 83\% / 41\% accuracy on math / science, while reversing the order to science$\rightarrow$math degrades performance to 77\% / 25\%; (3) no single strategy is universally optimal in multi-domain training: sequential training favors math (up to 84\%), mixed training favors science and logic, and poor ordering can incur large performance gaps (from 70\% to 56\%). Overall, our findings demonstrate that GRPO under multi-domain settings exhibits pronounced asymmetry, order sensitivity, and strategy dependence, highlighting the necessity of domain-aware and order-aware training design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Variational Contrastive Learning for Joint Risk Stratification and Time-to-Event Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01367</link><description>arXiv:2602.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival analysis is essential for clinical decision-making, as it allows practitioners to estimate time-to-event outcomes, stratify patient risk profiles, and guide treatment planning. Deep learning has revolutionized this field with unprecedented predictive capabilities but faces a fundamental trade-off between performance and interpretability. While neural networks achieve high accuracy, their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. Conversely, deep clustering-based methods that stratify patients into interpretable risk groups typically sacrifice predictive power. We propose CONVERSE (CONtrastive Variational Ensemble for Risk Stratification and Estimation), a deep survival model that bridges this gap by unifying variational autoencoders with contrastive learning for interpretable risk stratification. CONVERSE combines variational embeddings with multiple intra- and inter-cluster contrastive losses. Self-paced learning progressively incorporates samples from easy to hard, improving training stability. The model supports cluster-specific survival heads, enabling accurate ensemble predictions.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in financial decision-making, the opacity of complex models presents significant challenges for professionals and regulators. While the field of Explainable AI (XAI) attempts to bridge this gap, current research often reduces the implementation challenge to a binary trade-off between model accuracy and explainability. This paper argues that such a view is insufficient for the financial domain, where algorithmic choices must navigate a complex sociotechnical web of strict regulatory bounds, budget constraints, and latency requirements. Through semi-structured interviews with twenty finance professionals, ranging from C-suite executives and developers to regulators across multiple regions, this study empirically investigates how practitioners prioritize explainability relative to four competing factors: accuracy, compliance, cost, and speed. Our findings reveal that these priorities are structured not as a simple trade-off, but as a system of distinct prerequisites and constraints. Accuracy and compliance emerge as non-negotiable "hygiene factors": without them, an AI system is viewed as a liability regardless of its transparency. Operational levers (speed and cost) serve as secondary constraints that determine practical feasibility, while ease of understanding functions as a gateway to adoption, shaping whether AI tools are trusted, used, and defensible in practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01368v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exposing and Defending the Achilles' Heel of Video Mixture-of-Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01369</link><description>arXiv:2602.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated strong performance in video understanding tasks, yet its adversarial robustness remains underexplored. Existing attack methods often treat MoE as a unified architecture, overlooking the independent and collaborative weaknesses of key components such as routers and expert modules. To fill this gap, we propose Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (TLGA) to thoroughly investigate component-level vulnerabilities in video MoE models. We first design attacks on the router, revealing its independent weaknesses. Building on this, we introduce Joint Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (J-TLGA), which collaboratively perturb both routers and experts. This joint attack significantly amplifies adversarial effects and exposes the Achilles' Heel (collaborative weaknesses) of the MoE architecture. Based on these insights, we further propose Joint Temporal Lipschitz Adversarial Training (J-TLAT). J-TLAT performs joint training to further defend against collaborative weaknesses, enhancing component-wise robustness. Our framework is plug-and-play and reduces inference cost by more than 60% compared with dense models. It consistently enhances adversarial robustness across diverse datasets and architectures, effectively mitigating both the independent and collaborative weaknesses of MoE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01369v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PolyGen: Fully Synthetic Vision-Language Training via Multi-Generator Ensembles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01370</link><description>arXiv:2602.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data offers a scalable solution for vision-language pre-training, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on scaling up a single generative backbone, which introduces generator-specific spectral biases and limits feature diversity. In this work, we introduce PolyGen, a framework that redefines synthetic data construction by prioritizing manifold coverage and compositional rigor over simple dataset size. PolyGen employs a Polylithic approach to train on the intersection of architecturally distinct generators, effectively marginalizing out model-specific artifacts. Additionally, we introduce a Programmatic Hard Negative curriculum that enforces fine-grained syntactic understanding. By structurally reallocating the same data budget from unique captions to multi-source variations, PolyGen achieves a more robust feature space, outperforming the leading single-source baseline (SynthCLIP) by +19.0% on aggregate multi-task benchmarks and on the SugarCrepe++ compositionality benchmark (+9.1%). These results demonstrate that structural diversity is a more data-efficient scaling law than simply increasing the volume of single-source samples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01370v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context Dependence and Reliability in Autoregressive Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01378</link><description>arXiv:2602.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate outputs by utilizing extensive context, which often includes redundant information from prompts, retrieved passages, and interaction history. In critical applications, it is vital to identify which context elements actually influence the output, as standard explanation methods struggle with redundancy and overlapping context. Minor changes in input can lead to unpredictable shifts in attribution scores, undermining interpretability and raising concerns about risks like prompt injection. This work addresses the challenge of distinguishing essential context elements from correlated ones. We introduce RISE (Redundancy-Insensitive Scoring of Explanation), a method that quantifies the unique influence of each input relative to others, minimizing the impact of redundancies and providing clearer, stable attributions. Experiments demonstrate that RISE offers more robust explanations than traditional methods, emphasizing the importance of conditional information for trustworthy LLM explanations and monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01378v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Power of (Approximate) Reward Models for Inference-Time Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01381</link><description>arXiv:2602.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the reasoning capability of large language models. Among various approaches, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has become a particularly important framework, enabling iterative generation, evaluation, rejection, and resampling of intermediate reasoning trajectories. A central component in this process is the reward model, which evaluates partial solutions and guides the allocation of computation during inference.
  However, in practice, true reward models are never available. All deployed systems rely on approximate reward models, raising a fundamental question: Why and when do approximate reward models suffice for effective inference-time scaling? In this work, we provide a theoretical answer. We identify the Bellman error of the approximate reward model as the key quantity governing the effectiveness of SMC-based inference-time scaling. For a reasoning process of length $T$, we show that if the Bellman error of the approximate reward model is bounded by $O(1/T)$, then combining this reward model with SMC reduces the computational complexity of reasoning from exponential in $T$ to polynomial in $T$. This yields an exponential improvement in inference efficiency despite using only approximate rewards.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PromptRL: Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01382</link><description>arXiv:2602.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching models (FMs) have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) generation, with reinforcement learning (RL) serving as a critical post-training strategy for alignment with reward objectives. In this research, we show that current RL pipelines for FMs suffer from two underappreciated yet important limitations: sample inefficiency due to insufficient generation diversity, and pronounced prompt overfitting, where models memorize specific training formulations and exhibit dramatic performance collapse when evaluated on semantically equivalent but stylistically varied prompts. We present PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation), a framework that incorporates language models (LMs) as trainable prompt refinement agents directly within the flow-based RL optimization loop. This design yields two complementary benefits: rapid development of sophisticated prompt rewriting capabilities and, critically, a synergistic training regime that reshapes the optimization dynamics. PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval, 0.98 on OCR accuracy, and 24.05 on PickScore.
  Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving the EditReward of FLUX.1-Kontext from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as Nano Banana), which scores 1.37, and achieving comparable performance with ReasonNet (1.44), which relied on fine-grained data annotations along with a complex multi-stage training. Our extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that PromptRL consistently achieves higher performance ceilings while requiring over 2$\times$ fewer rollouts compared to naive flow-only RL.

Abstract: Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) matrices play a central role in coding theory and symmetric-key cryptography due to their optimal diffusion properties. In this paper, we present a construction of MDS matrices using skew polynomial rings \( \mathbb{F}_q[X;\theta,\delta] \), where \( \theta \) is an automorphism and \( \delta \) is a \( \theta\)-derivation on \( \mathbb{F}_q \). We introduce the notion of \( \delta_{\theta} \)-circulant matrices and study their structural properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived under which these matrices are involutory and satisfy the MDS property. The resulting $\delta_\theta$-circulant matrix can be viewed as a generalization of classical constructions obtained in the absence of $\theta$-derivations. One of the main contribution of this work is the construction of quasi recursive MDS matrices. In the setting of the skew polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[X;\theta]$, we construct quasi recursive MDS matrices associated with companion matrices.
  These matrices are shown to be involutory, yielding a strict improvement over the quasi-involutory constructions previously reported in the literature. Several illustrative results and examples are also provided.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01383v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TriphiBot: A Triphibious Robot Combining FOC-based Propulsion with Eccentric Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01385</link><description>arXiv:2602.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triphibious robots capable of multi-domain motion and cross-domain transitions are promising to handle complex tasks across diverse environments. However, existing designs primarily focus on dual-mode platforms, and some designs suffer from high mechanical complexity or low propulsion efficiency, which limits their application. In this paper, we propose a novel triphibious robot capable of aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic motion, by a minimalist design combining a quadcopter structure with two passive wheels, without extra actuators. To address inefficiency of ground-support motion (moving on land/seabed) for quadcopter based designs, we introduce an eccentric Center of Gravity (CoG) design that inherently aligns thrust with motion, enhancing efficiency without specialized mechanical transformation designs. Furthermore, to address the drastic differences in motion control caused by different fluids (air and water), we develop a unified propulsion system based on Field-Oriented Control (FOC). This method resolves torque matching issues and enables precise, rapid bidirectional thrust across different mediums. Grounded in the perspective of living condition and ground support, we analyse the robot's dynamics and propose a Hybrid Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HNMPC)-PID control system to ensure stable multi-domain motion and seamless transitions. Experimental results validate the robot's multi-domain motion and cross-mode transition capability, along with the efficiency and adaptability of the proposed propulsion system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01385v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "If You're Very Clever, No One Knows You've Used It": The Social Dynamics of Developing Generative AI Literacy in the Workplace</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01386</link><description>arXiv:2602.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are rapidly transforming knowledge work, making AI literacy a critical priority for organizations. However, research on AI literacy lacks empirical insight into how knowledge workers' beliefs around GenAI literacy are shaped by the social dynamics of the workplace, and how workers learn to apply GenAI tools in these environments. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth interviews with 19 knowledge workers across multiple sectors to examine how they develop GenAI competencies in real-world professional contexts. We found that, while knowledge sharing from colleagues supported learning, the ability to remove cues indicating GenAI use was perceived as validation of domain expertise. These behaviours ultimately reduced opportunities for learning via knowledge sharing and undermined transparency. To advance workplace AI literacy, we argue for fostering open dialogue, increasing visibility of user-generated knowledge, and greater emphasis on the benefits of collaborative learning for navigating rapid technological developments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Enhanced Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: Applications of Newton's Laws in Financial Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01388</link><description>arXiv:2602.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), a subset of machine learning focused on sequential decision-making, has emerged as a powerful approach for tackling financial trading problems. In finance, DRL is commonly used either to generate discrete trade signals or to determine continuous portfolio allocations. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for portfolio optimization that incorporates Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) into several DRL algorithms. The approach replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in both actor and critic components-utilizing learnable B-spline univariate functions to achieve parameter-efficient and more interpretable function approximation. During actor updates, we introduce a physics-informed regularization loss that promotes second-order temporal consistency between observed return dynamics and the action-induced portfolio adjustments. The proposed framework is evaluated across three equity markets-China, Vietnam, and the United States, covering both emerging and developed economies. Across all three markets, PIKAN-based agents consistently deliver higher cumulative and annualized returns, superior Sharpe and Calmar ratios, and more favorable drawdown characteristics compared to both standard DRL baselines and classical online portfolio-selection methods. This yields more stable training, higher Sharpe ratios, and superior performance compared to traditional DRL counterparts. The approach is particularly valuable in highly dynamic and noisy financial markets, where conventional DRL often suffers from instability and poor generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01388v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Instance-Guided Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Robotic Semantic Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01389</link><description>arXiv:2602.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks, which are essential for robotic perception, often suffer from performance degradation when the visual distribution of the deployment environment differs from that of the source dataset on which they were trained. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by adapting the network to the robot's target environment without external supervision, leveraging the large amounts of data a robot might naturally collect during long-term operation. In such settings, UDA methods can exploit multi-view consistency across the environment's map to fine-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion and mitigate domain shift. However, these approaches remain sensitive to cross-view instance-level inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a method that starts from a volumetric 3D map to generate multi-view consistent pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels using the zero-shot instance segmentation capabilities of a foundation model, enforcing instance-level coherence. The refined annotations serve as supervision for self-supervised fine-tuning, enabling the robot to adapt its perception system at deployment time. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance over state-of-the-art UDA baselines based on multi-view consistency, without requiring any ground-truth labels in the target domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How well can VLMs rate audio descriptions: A multi-dimensional quantitative assessment framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01390</link><description>arXiv:2602.01390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital video is central to communication, education, and entertainment, but without audio description (AD), blind and low-vision audiences are excluded. While crowdsourced platforms and vision-language-models (VLMs) expand AD production, quality is rarely checked systematically. Existing evaluations rely on NLP metrics and short-clip guidelines, leaving questions about what constitutes quality for full-length content and how to assess it at scale. To address these questions, we first developed a multi-dimensional assessment framework for uninterrupted, full-length video, grounded in professional guidelines and refined by accessibility specialists. Second, we integrated this framework into a comprehensive methodological workflow, utilizing Item Response Theory, to assess the proficiency of VLM and human raters against expert-established ground truth. Findings suggest that while VLMs can approximate ground-truth ratings with high alignment, their reasoning was found to be less reliable and actionable than that of human respondents. These insights show the potential of hybrid evaluation systems that leverage VLMs alongside human oversight, offering a path towards scalable AD quality control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Selective Knowledge Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01395</link><description>arXiv:2602.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing efforts to improve knowledge distillation (KD) in large language models (LLMs) replace dense teacher supervision with selective distillation, which uses a subset of token positions, vocabulary classes, or training samples for supervision. However, it remains unclear which importance signals, selection policies, and their interplay are most effective. In this work, we revisit where and how to distill in autoregressive LLMs. We disentangle selective KD along the position, class, and sample axes and systematically compare importance signals and selection policies. Then, guided by this analysis, we identify underexplored opportunities and introduce student-entropy-guided position selection (SE-KD). Across a suite of benchmarks, SE-KD often improves accuracy, downstream task adherence, and memory efficiency over dense distillation. Extending this approach across the class and sample axes (SE-KD 3X) yields complementary efficiency gains that make offline teacher caching feasible. In practice, this reduces wall time by 70% and peak memory by 18%, while cutting storage usage by 80% over prior methods without sacrificing performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01395v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nonlinear model reduction for transport-dominated problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01397</link><description>arXiv:2602.01397v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The Shapley value is a ubiquitous framework for attribution in machine learning, encompassing feature importance, data valuation, and causal inference. However, its exact computation is generally intractable, necessitating efficient approximation methods. While the most effective and popular estimators leverage the paired sampling heuristic to reduce estimation error, the theoretical mechanism driving this improvement has remained opaque. In this work, we provide an elegant and fundamental justification for paired sampling: we prove that the Shapley value depends exclusively on the odd component of the set function, and that paired sampling orthogonalizes the regression objective to filter out the irrelevant even component. Leveraging this insight, we propose OddSHAP, a novel consistent estimator that performs polynomial regression solely on the odd subspace. By utilizing the Fourier basis to isolate this subspace and employing a proxy model to identify high-impact interactions, OddSHAP overcomes the combinatorial explosion of higher-order approximations. Through an extensive benchmark evaluation, we find that OddSHAP achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01399v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Pragmas to Partners: A Symbiotic Evolution of Agentic High-Level Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01401</link><description>arXiv:2602.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of large language models has sparked interest in AI-driven hardware design, raising the question: does high-level synthesis (HLS) still matter in the agentic era? We argue that HLS remains essential. While we expect mature agentic hardware systems to leverage both HLS and RTL, this paper focuses on HLS and its role in enabling agentic optimization. HLS offers faster iteration cycles, portability, and design permutability that make it a natural layer for agentic optimization.This position paper makes three contributions. First, we explain why HLS serves as a practical abstraction layer and a golden reference for agentic hardware design. Second, we identify key limitations of current HLS tools, namely inadequate performance feedback, rigid interfaces, and limited debuggability that agents are uniquely positioned to address. Third, we propose a taxonomy for the symbiotic evolution of agentic HLS, clarifying how responsibility shifts from human designers to AI agents as systems advance from copilots to autonomous design partners.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01401v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BOA Constrictor: Squeezing Performance out of GPUs in the Cloud via Budget-Optimal Allocation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01404</link><description>arXiv:2602.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in demand for GPUs to train Machine Learning (ML) models. Because it is prohibitively expensive for most organizations to build and maintain a large GPU cluster, organizations instead choose to rent GPUs from cloud providers. The customer is responsible for devising a policy for (i) deciding how many GPUs to rent at every moment in time to process a stream of ML training jobs and (ii) allocating the rented GPUs among the currently active jobs in the system. Because ML training jobs can be parallelized across different numbers of GPUs, the customer generally has many options for how many GPUs to use for each job. Allocating more GPUs to a single training job will cause the job to complete more quickly. However, the customer pays for each GPU-hour they use, and a training job receives a diminishing marginal benefit from running on additional GPUs. Hence, allocating too many GPUs to a single training job can dramatically increase the overall cost that the customer pays to the cloud provider. This gives rise to a cost-performance tradeoff that customers must balance when running training jobs in the cloud.
  To balance the cost-performance tradeoff, we develop BOA Constrictor, a new scheduler for ML training jobs which uses a Budget-Optimal Allocation (BOA) policy to squeeze the highest level of performance out of a cloud-deployed GPU cluster given a fixed budget constraint. We explicitly formulate the problem as a budget-constrained scheduling problem and derive the BOA policy which minimizes the average job completion time (JCT) of a stream of arriving jobs subject to the user's budget. For a given budget level, we demonstrate that BOA Constrictor can reduce average JCT by 1.6 times in small-scale implementation experiments and by 2 times in detailed, large-scale simulations compared to state-of-the-art heuristic based schedulers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01404v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feedback by Design: Understanding and Overcoming User Feedback Barriers in Conversational Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01405</link><description>arXiv:2602.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality feedback is essential for effective human-AI interaction. It bridges knowledge gaps, corrects digressions, and shapes system behavior; both during interaction and throughout model development. Yet despite its importance, human feedback to AI is often infrequent and low quality. This gap motivates a critical examination of human feedback during interactions with AIs. To understand and overcome the challenges preventing users from giving high-quality feedback, we conducted two studies examining feedback dynamics between humans and conversational agents (CAs). Our formative study, through the lens of Grice's maxims, identified four Feedback Barriers -- Common Ground, Verifiability, Communication, and Informativeness -- that prevent high-quality feedback by users. Building on these findings, we derive three design desiderata and show that systems incorporating scaffolds aligned with these desiderata enabled users to provide higher-quality feedback. Finally, we detail a call for action to the broader AI community for advances in Large Language Models capabilities to overcome Feedback Barriers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01405v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SNIP: An Adaptive Mixed Precision Framework for Subbyte Large Language Model Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01410</link><description>arXiv:2602.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) efficiently while preserving model quality poses significant challenges, particularly with subbyte precision supported by state-of-the-art GPUs. Current mixed-precision training approaches either apply uniform precision to all GEMM operations or rely on heuristic-based methods that fail to generalize during training, leading to suboptimal convergence and instability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SNIP, a fine-grained adaptive mixed-precision training framework for LLM pretraining that supports subbyte precision. SNIP periodically collects statistics on activations, gradients, and optimizer states to assess the precision loss impact on model quality. We define two key metrics: loss divergence in the forward pass, caused by quantization-induced increases in training loss, and weight divergence in the backward pass, which measures error propagation through gradients affecting model updates. These metrics guide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that systematically optimizes layerwise precision to minimize overall quality loss while meeting efficiency targets. Experiments on 1B, 3B, 7B and 70B Llama-like models demonstrate that SNIP consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing FLOPs by up to 80% while preserving model quality across different model sizes and training phases with minimal computational overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01410v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mean field optimal Core Allocation across Malleable jobs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01411</link><description>arXiv:2602.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern data centers and cloud computing clusters are increasingly running workloads composed of malleable jobs. A malleable job can be parallelized across any number of cores, yet the job typically exhibits diminishing marginal returns for each additional core on which it runs. This can be seen in the concavity of a job's speedup function, which describes the job's processing speed as a function of the number of cores on which it runs.
  Given the prevalence of malleable jobs, several theoretical works have posed the problem of how to allocate a fixed number of cores across a stream of arriving malleable jobs so as to minimize the mean response time across jobs. We refer to this as the Core Allocation to Malleable jobs (CAM) problem. We solve the CAM problem under a highly general setting, allowing for multiple job classes, each with an arbitrary concave speedup function and holding costs (weight). Furthermore, we allow for generally distributed inter-arrival times and job sizes.
  We analyze the CAM problem in the mean field asymptotic regime and derive two distinct mean field optimal policies, FW-CAM and WHAM. FW-CAM is interesting because it demonstrates a new intuition: in the mean field regime, job sizes are not relevant in finding an optimal policy. WHAM (Whittle Allocation for Malleable jobs) is interesting because it is asymptotically optimal and also serves as a good heuristic even outside of the asymptotic regime. Notably, none of the policies previously proposed in the literature are mean field optimal when jobs may follow different speedup functions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01411v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evidence-Decision-Feedback: Theory-Driven Adaptive Scaffolding for LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01415</link><description>arXiv:2602.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent LLM architectures offer opportunities for pedagogical agents to help students construct domain knowledge and develop critical-thinking skills, yet many operate on a "one-size-fits-all" basis, limiting their ability to provide personalized support. To address this, we introduce Evidence-Decision-Feedback (EDF), a theoretical framework for adaptive scaffolding using LLMs. EDF integrates elements of intelligent tutoring systems and agentic behavior by organizing interactions around evidentiary inference, pedagogical decision-making, and adaptive feedback. We instantiate EDF through Copa, an agentic collaborative peer agent for STEM+C problem-solving. In an authentic high school classroom study, we show that EDF-aligned interactions align feedback with students' demonstrated understanding and task mastery; promote gradual scaffold fading; and support interpretable, evidence-grounded explanations without fostering overreliance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Where to Attend: A Principled Vision-Centric Position Encoding with Parabolas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01418</link><description>arXiv:2602.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Parabolic Position Encoding (PaPE), a parabola-based position encoding for vision modalities in attention-based architectures. Given a set of vision tokens-such as images, point clouds, videos, or event camera streams-our objective is to encode their positions while accounting for the characteristics of vision modalities. Prior works have largely extended position encodings from 1D-sequences in language to nD-structures in vision, but only with partial account of vision characteristics. We address this gap by designing PaPE from principles distilled from prior work: translation invariance, rotation invariance (PaPE-RI), distance decay, directionality, and context awareness. We evaluate PaPE on 8 datasets that span 4 modalities. We find that either PaPE or PaPE-RI achieves the top performance on 7 out of 8 datasets. Extrapolation experiments on ImageNet-1K show that PaPE extrapolates remarkably well, improving in absolute terms by up to 10.5% over the next-best position encoding.

Abstract: High-level Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) generates manufacturing process plans from part specifications. It suffers from limited dataset availability in industry, reducing model generalization. We propose a semi-supervised learning approach to improve transformer-based CAPP transformer models without manual labeling. An oracle, trained on available transformer behaviour data, filters correct predictions from unseen parts, which are then used for one-shot retraining. Experiments on small-scale datasets with simulated ground truth across the full data distribution show consistent accuracy gains over baselines, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in data-scarce manufacturing environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01419v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From One World to Another: Interfaces for Efficiently Transitioning Between Virtual Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01423</link><description>arXiv:2602.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personal computers and handheld devices provide keyboard shortcuts and swipe gestures to enable users to efficiently switch between applications, whereas today's virtual reality (VR) systems do not. In this work, we present an exploratory study on user interface aspects to support efficient switching between worlds in VR. We created eight interfaces that afford previewing and selecting from the available virtual worlds, including methods using portals and worlds-in-miniature (WiMs). To evaluate these methods, we conducted a controlled within-subjects empirical experiment (N=22) where participants frequently transitioned between six different environments to complete an object collection task. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that WiMs supported rapid acquisition of high-level spatial information while searching and were deemed most efficient by participants while portals provided fast pre-orientation. Finally, we present insights into the applicability, usability, and effectiveness of the VR world switching methods we explored, and provide recommendations for their application and future context/world switching techniques and interfaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01423v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Building Better Deception Probes Using Targeted Instruction Pairs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01425</link><description>arXiv:2602.01425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear probes are a promising approach for monitoring AI systems for deceptive behaviour. Previous work has shown that a linear classifier trained on a contrastive instruction pair and a simple dataset can achieve good performance. However, these probes exhibit notable failures even in straightforward scenarios, including spurious correlations and false positives on non-deceptive responses. In this paper, we identify the importance of the instruction pair used during training. Furthermore, we show that targeting specific deceptive behaviors through a human-interpretable taxonomy of deception leads to improved results on evaluation datasets. Our findings reveal that instruction pairs capture deceptive intent rather than content-specific patterns, explaining why prompt choice dominates probe performance (70.6% of variance). Given the heterogeneity of deception types across datasets, we conclude that organizations should design specialized probes targeting their specific threat models rather than seeking a universal deception detector.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01425v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improve the Trade-off Between Watermark Strength and Speculative Sampling Efficiency for Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01428</link><description>arXiv:2602.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking is a principled approach for tracing the provenance of large language model (LLM) outputs, but its deployment in practice is hindered by inference inefficiency. Speculative sampling accelerates inference, with efficiency improving as the acceptance rate between draft and target models increases. Yet recent work reveals a fundamental trade-off: higher watermark strength reduces acceptance, preventing their simultaneous achievement. We revisit this trade-off and show it is not absolute. We introduce a quantitative measure of watermark strength that governs statistical detectability and is maximized when tokens are deterministic functions of pseudorandom numbers. Using this measure, we fully characterize the trade-off as a constrained optimization problem and derive explicit Pareto curves for two existing watermarking schemes. Finally, we introduce a principled mechanism that injects pseudorandomness into draft-token acceptance, ensuring maximal watermark strength while maintaining speculative sampling efficiency. Experiments further show that this approach improves detectability without sacrificing efficiency. Our findings uncover a principle that unites speculative sampling and watermarking, paving the way for their efficient and practical deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sem-NaVAE: Semantically-Guided Outdoor Mapless Navigation via Generative Trajectory Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01429</link><description>arXiv:2602.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a mapless global navigation approach for outdoor applications. It combines the exploratory capacity of conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to generate trajectories and the semantic segmentation capabilities of a lightweight visual language model (VLM) to select the trajectory to execute. Open-vocabulary segmentation is used to score and select the generated trajectories based on natural language, and a state-of-the-art local planner executes velocity commands. One of the key features of the proposed approach is its ability to generate a large variability of trajectories and to select them and navigate in real-time. The approach was validated through real-world outdoor navigation experiments, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multivariate time series in domains such as finance, climate science, and healthcare often exhibit long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and short-term fluctuations, complicating causal inference under non-stationarity and autocorrelation. Existing causal discovery methods typically operate on raw observations, making them vulnerable to spurious edges and misattributed temporal dependencies. We introduce a decomposition-based causal discovery framework that separates each time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and performs component-specific causal analysis. Trend components are assessed using stationarity tests, seasonal components using kernel-based dependence measures, and residual components using constraint-based causal discovery. The resulting component-level graphs are integrated into a unified multi-scale causal structure. This approach isolates long- and short-range causal effects, reduces spurious associations, and improves interpretability. Across extensive synthetic benchmarks and real-world climate data, our framework more accurately recovers ground-truth causal structure than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under strong non-stationarity and temporal autocorrelation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Phase Transitions for Feature Learning in Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01434</link><description>arXiv:2602.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to a popular viewpoint, neural networks learn from data by first identifying low-dimensional representations, and subsequently fitting the best model in this space. Recent works provide a formalization of this phenomenon when learning multi-index models. In this setting, we are given $n$ i.i.d. pairs $({\boldsymbol x}_i,y_i)$, where the covariate vectors ${\boldsymbol x}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ are isotropic, and responses $y_i$ only depend on ${\boldsymbol x}_i$ through a $k$-dimensional projection ${\boldsymbol \Theta}_*^{{\sf T}}{\boldsymbol x}_i$. Feature learning amounts to learning the latent space spanned by ${\boldsymbol \Theta}_*$.
  In this context, we study the gradient descent dynamics of two-layer neural networks under the proportional asymptotics $n,d\to\infty$, $n/d\to\delta$, while the dimension of the latent space $k$ and the number of hidden neurons $m$ are kept fixed. Earlier work establishes that feature learning via polynomial-time algorithms is possible if $\delta&gt; \delta_{\text{alg}}$, for $\delta_{\text{alg}}$ a threshold depending on the data distribution, and is impossible (within a certain class of algorithms) below $\delta_{\text{alg}}$. Here we derive an analogous threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ for two-layer networks. Our characterization of $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ opens the way to study the dependence of learning dynamics on the network architecture and training algorithm.
  The threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ is determined by the following scenario. Training first visits points for which the gradient of the empirical risk is large and learns the directions spanned by these gradients. Then the gradient becomes smaller and the dynamics becomes dominated by negative directions of the Hessian. The threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ corresponds to a phase transition in the spectrum of the Hessian in this second phase.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01434v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BioTamperNet: Affinity-Guided State-Space Model Detecting Tampered Biomedical Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01435</link><description>arXiv:2602.01435v1 Announce Type: new

Our design integrates lightweight SSM-inspired linear attention mechanisms to enable efficient, fine-grained localization. Trained end-to-end, BioTamperNet simultaneously identifies tampered regions and their source counterparts. Extensive experiments on the benchmark bio-forensic datasets demonstrate significant improvements over competitive baselines in accurately detecting duplicated regions.

Abstract: The problem of corrupted data, missing features, or missing modalities continues to plague the modern machine learning landscape. To address this issue, a class of regularization methods that enforce consistency between imputed and fully observed data has emerged as a promising approach for improving model generalization, particularly in partially observed settings. We refer to this class of methods as Measure Consistency Regularization (MCR). Despite its empirical success in various applications, such as image inpainting, data imputation and semi-supervised learning, a fundamental understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of MCR remains limited. This paper bridges this gap by offering theoretical insights into why, when, and how MCR enhances imputation quality under partial observability, viewed through the lens of neural network distance.
  Our theoretical analysis identifies the term responsible for MCR's generalization advantage and extends to the imperfect training regime, demonstrating that this advantage is not always guaranteed. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel training protocol that monitors the duality gap to determine an early stopping point that preserves the generalization benefit. We then provide detailed empirical evidence to support our theoretical claims and to show the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed stopping condition. We further provide a set of real-world data simulations to show the versatility of MCR under different model architectures designed for different data sources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01437v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CIPHER: Cryptographic Insecurity Profiling via Hybrid Evaluation of Responses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01438</link><description>arXiv:2602.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assist developers with code, yet their implementations of cryptographic functionality often contain exploitable flaws.

CIPHER uses insecure/neutral/secure prompt variants per task, a cryptography-specific vulnerability taxonomy, and line-level attribution via an automated scoring pipeline. Across a diverse set of widely used LLMs, we find that explicit ``secure'' prompting reduces some targeted issues but does not reliably eliminate cryptographic vulnerabilities overall. The benchmark and reproducible scoring pipeline will be publicly released upon publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TQL: Scaling Q-Functions with Transformers by Preventing Attention Collapse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01439</link><description>arXiv:2602.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite scale driving substantial recent advancements in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) methods still primarily use small value functions. Naively scaling value functions -- including with a transformer architecture, which is known to be highly scalable -- often results in learning instability and worse performance. In this work, we ask what prevents transformers from scaling effectively for value functions? Through empirical analysis, we identify the critical failure mode in this scaling: attention scores collapse as capacity increases. Our key insight is that we can effectively prevent this collapse and stabilize training by controlling the entropy of the attention scores, thereby enabling the use of larger models. To this end, we propose Transformer Q-Learning (TQL), a method that unlocks the scaling potential of transformers in learning value functions in RL. Our approach yields up to a 43% improvement in performance when scaling from the smallest to the largest network sizes, while prior methods suffer from performance degradation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Gradient-Causal Gap: Why Gradient Importance Fails on Complex Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01442</link><description>arXiv:2602.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing ''important'' high-gradient components from a neural network can improve generalization, while removing unimportant'' low-gradient components can destroy it. We demonstrate this paradox by formalizing the \textit{Gradient-Causal Gap} in Transformers trained on algorithmic tasks. While gradient magnitude and causal importance align on simple tasks ($\rho=0.73$ for reversal), this relationship collapses as task complexity increases ($\rho=0.32$ for sorting), sometimes becoming inverted ($\rho=-0.11$). Pruning experiments reveal that gradient magnitude is not merely inaccurate but \textit{unpredictably} so. Removing low-gradient ''Hidden Heroes'' consistently devastates OOD accuracy ($-32\%$). Removing high-gradient ''Gradient Bloats'' is a coin flip: harmless in most seeds (indicating optimization noise), catastrophic in others (indicating overfitting circuits). This unpredictability means gradient-based pruning cannot reliably preserve model capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SimGym: Traffic-Grounded Browser Agents for Offline A/B Testing in E-Commerce</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01443</link><description>arXiv:2602.01443v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) plays a central role in the performance of deep learning models, yet remains computationally expensive and difficult to interpret, particularly for time-series forecasting. While Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a standard approach, it typically treats tuning tasks independently and provides limited insight into its decisions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to incorporate structured prior knowledge and reasoning into optimization pipelines. We introduce LLM-AutoOpt, a hybrid HPO framework that combines BO with LLM-based contextual reasoning. The framework encodes dataset meta-features, model descriptions, historical optimization outcomes, and target objectives as structured meta-knowledge within LLM prompts, using BO to initialize the search and mitigate cold-start effects. This design enables context-aware and stable hyperparameter refinement while exposing the reasoning behind optimization decisions. Experiments on a multivariate time series forecasting benchmark demonstrate that LLM-AutoOpt achieves improved predictive performance and more interpretable optimization behavior compared to BO and LLM baselines without meta-knowledge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SentiFuse: Deep Multi-model Fusion Framework for Robust Sentiment Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01447</link><description>arXiv:2602.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis models exhibit complementary strengths, yet existing approaches lack a unified framework for effective integration. We present SentiFuse, a flexible and model-agnostic framework that integrates heterogeneous sentiment models through a standardization layer and multiple fusion strategies. Our approach supports decision-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and adaptive fusion, enabling systematic combination of diverse models. We conduct experiments on three large-scale social-media datasets: Crowdflower, GoEmotions, and Sentiment140. These experiments show that SentiFuse consistently outperforms individual models and naive ensembles. Feature-level fusion achieves the strongest overall effectiveness, yielding up to 4\% absolute improvement in F1 score over the best individual model and simple averaging, while adaptive fusion enhances robustness on challenging cases such as negation, mixed emotions, and complex sentiment expressions. These results demonstrate that systematically leveraging model complementarity yields more accurate and reliable sentiment analysis across diverse datasets and text types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01447v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards a Novel Wearable Robotic Vest for Hemorrhage Suppression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01448</link><description>arXiv:2602.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robotic system designed to manage severe bleeding in emergency scenarios, including unique environments like space stations. The robot features a shape-adjustable "ring mechanism", transitioning from a circular to an elliptical configuration to adjust wound coverage across various anatomical regions. We developed various arms for this ring mechanism with varying flexibilities to improve adaptability when applied to non-extremities of the body (abdomen, back, neck, etc.). To apply equal and constant pressure across the wound, we developed an inflatable ring and airbag balloon that are compatible with this shape-changing ring mechanism. A series of experiments focused on evaluating various ring arm configurations to characterize their bending stiffness. Subsequent experiments measured the force exerted by the airbag balloon system using a digital scale. Despite its promising performance, certain limitations related to coverage area are identified. The shape-changing effect of the device is limited to scenarios involving partially inflated or deflated airbag balloons, and cannot fully conform to complex anatomical regions. Finally, the device was tested on casualty simulation kits, where it successfully demonstrated its ability to control simulated bleeding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01448v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dimension-Free Multimodal Sampling via Preconditioned Annealed Langevin Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01449</link><description>arXiv:2602.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing algorithms that can explore multimodal target distributions accurately across successive refinements of an underlying high-dimensional problem is a central challenge in sampling. Annealed Langevin dynamics (ALD) is a widely used alternative to classical Langevin since it often yields much faster mixing on multimodal targets, but there is still a gap between this empirical success and existing theory: when, and under which design choices, can ALD be guaranteed to remain stable as dimension increases? In this paper, we help bridge this gap by providing a uniform-in-dimension analysis of continuous-time ALD for multimodal targets that can be well-approximated by Gaussian mixture models. Along an explicit annealing path obtained by progressively removing Gaussian smoothing of the target, we identify sufficient spectral conditions - linking smoothing covariance and the covariances of the Gaussian components of the mixture - under which ALD achieves a prescribed accuracy within a single, dimension-uniform time horizon. We then establish dimension-robustness to imperfect initialization and score approximation: under a misspecified-mixture score model, we derive explicit conditions showing that preconditioning the ALD algorithm with a sufficiently decaying spectrum is necessary to prevent error terms from accumulating across coordinates and destroying dimension-uniform control. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate and validate the theory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Algorithmic Self-Portrait: Deconstructing Memory in ChatGPT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01450</link><description>arXiv:2602.01450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable personalized and context-aware interactions, conversational AI systems have introduced a new mechanism: Memory. Memory creates what we refer to as the Algorithmic Self-portrait - a new form of personalization derived from users' self-disclosed information divulged within private conversations. While memory enables more coherent exchanges, the underlying processes of memory creation remain opaque, raising critical questions about data sensitivity, user agency, and the fidelity of the resulting portrait.
  To bridge this research gap, we analyze 2,050 memory entries from 80 real-world ChatGPT users. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (1) A striking 96% of memories in our dataset are created unilaterally by the conversational system, potentially shifting agency away from the user; (2) Memories, in our dataset, contain a rich mix of GDPR-defined personal data (in 28% memories) along with psychological insights about participants (in 52% memories); and (3)~A significant majority of the memories (84%) are directly grounded in user context, indicating faithful representation of the conversations. Finally, we introduce a framework-Attribution Shield-that anticipates these inferences, alerts about potentially sensitive memory inferences, and suggests query reformulations to protect personal information without sacrificing utility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01450v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding QA generation: Extracting Parametric and Contextual Knowledge with CQA for Low Resource Bangla Language</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01451</link><description>arXiv:2602.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) models for low-resource languages like Bangla face challenges due to limited annotated data and linguistic complexity. A key issue is determining whether models rely more on pre-encoded (parametric) knowledge or contextual input during answer generation, as existing Bangla QA datasets lack the structure required for such analysis. We introduce BanglaCQA, the first Counterfactual QA dataset in Bangla, by extending a Bangla dataset while integrating counterfactual passages and answerability annotations. In addition, we propose fine-tuned pipelines for encoder-decoder language-specific and multilingual baseline models, and prompting-based pipelines for decoder-only LLMs to disentangle parametric and contextual knowledge in both factual and counterfactual scenarios. Furthermore, we apply LLM-based and human evaluation techniques that measure answer quality based on semantic similarity. We also present a detailed analysis of how models perform across different QA settings in low-resource languages, and show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reveals a uniquely effective mechanism for extracting parametric knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, particularly in decoder-only LLMs. Our work not only introduces a novel framework for analyzing knowledge sources in Bangla QA but also uncovers critical findings that open up broader directions for counterfactual reasoning in low-resource language settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01451v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Paradigm Evaluation of Gaze-Based Semantic Object Identification for Intelligent Vehicles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01452</link><description>arXiv:2602.01452v1 Announce Type: new

Specifically, the collocation of gaze points with object semantics is investigated using three distinct vision-based approaches: direct object detection (YOLOv13), segmentation-assisted classification (SAM2 paired with EfficientNetV2 versus YOLOv13), and query-based Vision-Language Models, VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-7b versus Qwen2.5-VL-32b). The results demonstrate that the direct object detection (YOLOv13) and Qwen2.5-VL-32b significantly outperform other approaches, achieving Macro F1-Scores over 0.84. The large VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32b), in particular, exhibited superior robustness and performance for identifying small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights, especially in adverse nighttime conditions. Conversely, the segmentation-assisted paradigm suffers from a "part-versus-whole" semantic gap that led to large failure in recall. The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the real-time efficiency of traditional detectors and the richer contextual understanding and robustness offered by large VLMs. These findings provide critical insights and practical guidance for the design of future human-aware intelligent driver monitoring systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01452v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Provable Cooperative Multi-Agent Exploration for Reward-Free MDPs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01453</link><description>arXiv:2602.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning in the setting of reward-free exploration, where multiple agents jointly explore an unknown MDP in order to learn its dynamics (without observing rewards). We focus on a tabular finite-horizon MDP and adopt a phased learning framework. In each learning phase, multiple agents independently interact with the environment. More specifically, in each learning phase, each agent is assigned a policy, executes it, and observes the resulting trajectory. Our primary goal is to characterize the tradeoff between the number of learning phases and the number of agents, especially when the number of learning phases is small.
  Our results identify a sharp transition governed by the horizon $H$. When the number of learning phases equals $H$, we present a computationally efficient algorithm that uses only $\tilde{O}(S^6 H^6 A / \epsilon^2)$ agents to obtain an $\epsilon$ approximation of the dynamics (i.e., yields an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for any reward function). We complement our algorithm with a lower bound showing that any algorithm restricted to $\rho &lt; H$ phases requires at least $A^{H/\rho}$ agents to achieve constant accuracy. Thus, we show that it is essential to have an order of $H$ learning phases if we limit the number of agents to be polynomial.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01453v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rectified LpJEPA: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures with Sparse and Maximum-Entropy Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01456</link><description>arXiv:2602.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) learn view-invariant representations and admit projection-based distribution matching for collapse prevention. Existing approaches regularize representations towards isotropic Gaussian distributions, but inherently favor dense representations and fail to capture the key property of sparsity observed in efficient representations. We introduce Rectified Distribution Matching Regularization (RDMReg), a sliced two-sample distribution-matching loss that aligns representations to a Rectified Generalized Gaussian (RGG) distribution. RGG enables explicit control over expected $\ell_0$ norm through rectification, while preserving maximum-entropy up to rescaling under expected $\ell_p$ norm constraints. Equipping JEPAs with RDMReg yields Rectified LpJEPA, which strictly generalizes prior Gaussian-based JEPAs. Empirically, Rectified LpJEPA learns sparse, non-negative representations with favorable sparsity-performance trade-offs and competitive downstream performance on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating that RDMReg effectively enforces sparsity while preserving task-relevant information.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01456v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding vision transformer robustness through the lens of out-of-distribution detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01459</link><description>arXiv:2602.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision transformers have shown remarkable performance in vision tasks, but enabling them for accessible and real-time use is still challenging. Quantization reduces memory and inference costs at the risk of performance loss. Strides have been made to mitigate low precision issues mainly by understanding in-distribution (ID) task behaviour, but the attention mechanism may provide insight on quantization attributes by exploring out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. We investigate the behaviour of quantized small-variant popular vision transformers (DeiT, DeiT3, and ViT) on common OOD datasets. ID analyses show the initial instabilities of 4-bit models, particularly of those trained on the larger ImageNet-22k, as the strongest FP32 model, DeiT3, sharply drop 17% from quantization error to be one of the weakest 4-bit models. While ViT shows reasonable quantization robustness for ID calibration, OOD detection reveals more: ViT and DeiT3 pretrained on ImageNet-22k respectively experienced a 15.0% and 19.2% average quantization delta in AUPR-out between full precision to 4-bit while their ImageNet-1k-only counterparts experienced a 9.5% and 12.0% delta. Overall, our results suggest pretraining on large scale datasets may hinder low-bit quantization robustness in OOD detection and that data augmentation may be a more beneficial option.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01459v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A $5$-Approximation Analysis for the Cover Small Cuts Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01462</link><description>arXiv:2602.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Cover Small Cuts problem, we are given a capacitated (undirected) graph $G=(V,E,u)$ and a threshold value $\lambda$, as well as a set of links $L$ with end-nodes in $V$ and a non-negative cost for each link $\ell\in L$; the goal is to find a minimum-cost set of links such that each non-trivial cut of capacity less than $\lambda$ is covered by a link. Bansal, Cheriyan, Grout, and Ibrahimpur (arXiv:2209.11209, Algorithmica 2024) showed that the WGMV primal-dual algorithm, due to Williamson, Goemans, Mihail, and Vazirani (Combinatorica, 1995), achieves approximation ratio $16$ for the Cover Small Cuts problem; their analysis uses the notion of a pliable family of sets that satisfies a combinatorial property. Later, Bansal (arXiv:2308.15714v2, IPCO 2025) and then Nutov (arXiv:2504.03910, MFCS 2025) proved that the same algorithm achieves approximation ratio $6$. We show that the same algorithm achieves approximation ratio $5$, by using a stronger notion, namely, a pliable family of sets that satisfies symmetry and structural submodularity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01462v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agyn: A Multi-Agent System for Team-Based Autonomous Software Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01465</link><description>arXiv:2602.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in individual software engineering tasks, yet most autonomous systems still treat issue resolution as a monolithic or pipeline-based process. In contrast, real-world software development is organized as a collaborative activity carried out by teams following shared methodologies, with clear role separation, communication, and review. In this work, we present a fully automated multi-agent system that explicitly models software engineering as an organizational process, replicating the structure of an engineering team. Built on top of agyn, an open-source platform for configuring agent teams, our system assigns specialized agents to roles such as coordination, research, implementation, and review, provides them with isolated sandboxes for experimentation, and enables structured communication. The system follows a defined development methodology for working on issues, including analysis, task specification, pull request creation, and iterative review, and operates without any human intervention. Importantly, the system was designed for real production use and was not tuned for SWE-bench. When evaluated post hoc on SWE-bench 500, it resolves 72.4% of tasks, outperforming single-agent baselines using comparable language models. Our results suggest that replicating team structure, methodology, and communication is a powerful paradigm for autonomous software engineering, and that future progress may depend as much on organizational design and agent infrastructure as on model improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01465v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Statistical Theory of Gated Attention through the Lens of Hierarchical Mixture of Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01468</link><description>arXiv:2602.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-attention has greatly contributed to the success of the widely used Transformer architecture by enabling learning from data with long-range dependencies. In an effort to improve performance, a gated attention model that leverages a gating mechanism within the multi-head self-attention has recently been proposed as a promising alternative. Gated attention has been empirically demonstrated to increase the expressiveness of low-rank mapping in standard attention and even to eliminate the attention sink phenomenon. Despite its efficacy, a clear theoretical understanding of gated attention's benefits remains lacking in the literature. To close this gap, we rigorously show that each entry in a gated attention matrix or a multi-head self-attention matrix can be written as a hierarchical mixture of experts. By recasting learning as an expert estimation problem, we demonstrate that gated attention is more sample-efficient than multi-head self-attention. In particular, while the former needs only a polynomial number of data points to estimate an expert, the latter requires exponentially many data points to achieve the same estimation error. Furthermore, our analysis also provides a theoretical justification for why gated attention yields higher performance when a gate is placed at the output of the scaled dot product attention or the value map rather than at other positions in the multi-head self-attention architecture.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01468v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] P-EAGLE: Parallel-Drafting EAGLE with Scalable Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01469</link><description>arXiv:2602.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning LLMs produce longer outputs, requiring speculative decoding drafters trained on extended sequences. Parallel drafting - predicting multiple tokens per forward pass - offers latency benefits over sequential generation, but training complexity scales quadratically with the product of sequence length and parallel positions, rendering long-context training impractical. We present P(arallel)-EAGLE, which transforms EAGLE from autoregressive to parallel multi-token prediction via a learnable shared hidden state. To scale training to long contexts, we develop a framework featuring attention mask pre-computation and sequence partitioning techniques, enabling gradient accumulation within individual sequences for parallel-prediction training. We implement P-EAGLE in vLLM and demonstrate speedups of 1.10-1.36x over autoregressive EAGLE-3 across GPT-OSS 120B, 20B, and Qwen3-Coder 30B.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01469v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ConPress: Learning Efficient Reasoning from Multi-Question Contextual Pressure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01472</link><description>arXiv:2602.01472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) typically solve reasoning-intensive tasks by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, leading to substantial inference overhead. We identify a reproducible inference-time phenomenon, termed Self-Compression: when multiple independent and answerable questions are presented within a single prompt, the model spontaneously produces shorter reasoning traces for each question. This phenomenon arises from multi-question contextual pressure during generation and consistently manifests across models and benchmarks. Building on this observation, we propose ConPress (Learning from Contextual Pressure), a lightweight self-supervised fine-tuning approach. ConPress constructs multi-question prompts to induce self-compression, samples the resulting model outputs, and parses and filters per-question traces to obtain concise yet correct reasoning trajectories. These trajectories are directly used for supervised fine-tuning, internalizing compressed reasoning behavior in single-question settings without external teachers, manual pruning, or reinforcement learning. With only 8k fine-tuning examples, ConPress reduces reasoning token usage by 59% on MATH500 and 33% on AIME25, while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01472v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Legal Infrastructure for Transformative AI Governance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01474</link><description>arXiv:2602.01474v1 Announce Type: new

The transformative nature of AI calls especially for attention to building legal and regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) is a fundamental yet computationally challenging problem arising in domains such as diagnosis, planning, and structured prediction. In many practical settings, the graphical model remains fixed while inference must be performed repeatedly for varying evidence patterns. Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms scale to large models but rely on myopic best-improvement rule that prioritizes immediate likelihood gains and often stagnate in poor local optima. Heuristics such as Guided Local Search (GLS+) partially alleviate this limitation by modifying the search landscape, but their guidance cannot be reused effectively across multiple inference queries on the same model. We propose a neural amortization framework for improving local search in this repeated-query regime. Exploiting the fixed graph structure, we train an attention-based network to score local moves by predicting their ability to reduce Hamming distance to a near-optimal solution. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing local search procedures, using this signal to balance short-term likelihood gains with long-term promise during neighbor selection. We provide theoretical intuition linking distance-reducing move selection to improved convergence behavior, and empirically demonstrate consistent improvements over SLS and GLS+ on challenging high-treewidth benchmarks in the amortized inference setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01475v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ebisu: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Japanese Finance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01479</link><description>arXiv:2602.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Japanese finance combines agglutinative, head-final linguistic structure, mixed writing systems, and high-context communication norms that rely on indirect expression and implicit commitment, posing a substantial challenge for LLMs. We introduce Ebisu, a benchmark for native Japanese financial language understanding, comprising two linguistically and culturally grounded, expert-annotated tasks: JF-ICR, which evaluates implicit commitment and refusal recognition in investor-facing Q&amp;amp;A, and JF-TE, which assesses hierarchical extraction and ranking of nested financial terminology from professional disclosures. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source and proprietary LLMs spanning general-purpose, Japanese-adapted, and financial models. Results show that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on both tasks. While increased model scale yields limited improvements, language- and domain-specific adaptation does not reliably improve performance, leaving substantial gaps unresolved. Ebisu provides a focused benchmark for advancing linguistically and culturally grounded financial NLP. All datasets and evaluation scripts are publicly released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rod Flow: A Continuous-Time Model for Gradient Descent at the Edge of Stability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01480</link><description>arXiv:2602.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we understand gradient-based training over non-convex landscapes? The edge of stability phenomenon, introduced in Cohen et al. (2021), indicates that the answer is not so simple: namely, gradient descent (GD) with large step sizes often diverges away from the gradient flow. In this regime, the "Central Flow", recently proposed in Cohen et al. (2025), provides an accurate ODE approximation to the GD dynamics over many architectures. In this work, we propose Rod Flow, an alternative ODE approximation, which carries the following advantages: (1) it rests on a principled derivation stemming from a physical picture of GD iterates as an extended one-dimensional object -- a "rod"; (2) it better captures GD dynamics for simple toy examples and matches the accuracy of Central Flow for representative neural network architectures, and (3) is explicit and cheap to compute. Theoretically, we prove that Rod Flow correctly predicts the critical sharpness threshold and explains self-stabilization in quartic potentials. We validate our theory with a range of numerical experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01480v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting and improving test-time scaling laws via reward tail-guided search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01485</link><description>arXiv:2602.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a critical avenue for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Though the straight-forward ''best-of-$N$'' (BoN) strategy has already demonstrated significant improvements in performance, it lacks principled guidance on the choice of $N$, budget allocation, and multi-stage decision-making, thereby leaving substantial room for optimization. While many works have explored such optimization, rigorous theoretical guarantees remain limited. In this work, we propose new methodologies to predict and improve scaling properties via tail-guided search. By estimating the tail distribution of rewards, our method predicts the scaling law of LLMs without the need for exhaustive evaluations. Leveraging this prediction tool, we introduce Scaling-Law Guided (SLG) Search, a new test-time algorithm that dynamically allocates compute to identify and exploit intermediate states with the highest predicted potential. We theoretically prove that SLG achieves vanishing regret compared to perfect-information oracles, and achieves expected rewards that would otherwise require a polynomially larger compute budget required when using BoN. Empirically, we validate our framework across different LLMs and reward models, confirming that tail-guided allocation consistently achieves higher reward yields than Best-of-$N$ under identical compute budgets.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in data-driven surrogates for dynamical systems that can be orders of magnitude faster than numerical solvers. However, many machine learning-based models such as neural operators exhibit spectral bias, attenuating high-frequency components that often encode small-scale structure. This limitation is particularly damaging in applications such as weather forecasting, where misrepresented high frequencies can induce long-horizon instability. To address this issue, we propose multi-scale wavelet transformers (MSWTs), which learn system dynamics in a tokenized wavelet domain. The wavelet transform explicitly separates low- and high-frequency content across scales. MSWTs leverage a wavelet-preserving downsampling scheme that retains high-frequency features and employ wavelet-based attention to capture dependencies across scales and frequency bands. Experiments on chaotic dynamical systems show substantial error reductions and improved long horizon spectral fidelity. On the ERA5 climate reanalysis, MSWTs further reduce climatological bias, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world forecasting setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01486v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DuoLungo: Usability Study of Duo 2FA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01489</link><description>arXiv:2602.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances login security by requiring multiple authentication factors. Its adoption has increased in response to more frequent and sophisticated attacks. Duo is widely used by organizations including Fortune 500 companies and major educational institutions, yet its usability has not been examined thoroughly or recently. Earlier studies focused on technical challenges during initial deployment but did not measure core usability metrics such as task completion time or System Usability Scale (SUS) scores. These results are also outdated, originating from a time when MFA was less familiar to typical users.
  We conducted a long-term, large-scale Duo usability study at the University of California Irvine during the 2024-2025 academic year, involving 2559 participants. Our analysis uses authentication log data and a survey of 57 randomly selected users. The average overhead of a Duo Push task is nearly 8 seconds, which participants described as short to moderate. Overhead varies with time of day, field of study, and education level. The rate of authentication failures due to incomplete Duo tasks is 4.35 percent, and 43.86 percent of survey respondents reported at least one Duo login failure. The Duo SUS score is 70, indicating good usability. Participants generally find Duo easy to use but somewhat annoying, while also reporting an increased sense of account security. They also described common issues and offered suggestions for improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01489v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sleep Reveals the Nonce: Breaking ECDSA using Sleep-Based Power Side-Channel Vulnerability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01491</link><description>arXiv:2602.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) depends on the secrecy of the per-signature nonce. Even partial nonce leakage can expose the long-term private key through lattice-based cryptanalysis. In this paper, we introduce a previously unexplored power side-channel vulnerability that exploits sleep-induced power spikes to extract ECDSA nonces. Unlike conventional power-based side-channel attacks, this vulnerability leverages power fluctuations generated during processor context switches invoked by sleep functions. These fluctuations correlate with nonce-dependent operations in scalar multiplication, enabling nonce recovery even under constant-time and masked implementations. We evaluate the attack across multiple cryptographic libraries, RustCrypto, BearSSL, and GoCrypto, and processor architectures, including ARM and RISC-V. Our experiments show that subtle variations in the power envelope during sleep-induced context switches provide sufficient leakage for practical ECDSA nonce extraction, recovering 20 bits of the nonce. These results establish sleep-induced power spikes as a practical cross-platform side-channel threat and highlight the need to reconsider design choices in cryptographic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01491v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OpInf-LLM: Parametric PDE Solving with LLMs via Operator Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01493</link><description>arXiv:2602.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving diverse partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental in science and engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, symbolic reasoning, and tool use, but reliably solving PDEs across heterogeneous settings remains challenging. Prior work on LLM-based code generation and transformer-based foundation models for PDE learning has shown promising advances. However, a persistent trade-off between execution success rate and numerical accuracy arises, particularly when generalization to unseen parameters and boundary conditions is required. In this work, we propose OpInf-LLM, an LLM parametric PDE solving framework based on operator inference. The proposed framework leverages a small amount of solution data to enable accurate prediction of diverse PDE instances, including unseen parameters and configurations, and provides seamless integration with LLMs for natural language specification of PDE solving tasks. Its low computational demands and unified tool interface further enable a high execution success rate across heterogeneous settings. By combining operator inference with LLM capabilities, OpInf-LLM opens new possibilities for generalizable reduced-order modeling in LLM-based PDE solving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01493v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Draw2Learn: A Human-AI Collaborative Tool for Drawing-Based Science Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01494</link><description>arXiv:2602.01494v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Degenerate Cahn-Hilliard phase-field models provide a robust approximation of surface-diffusion-driven interface motion without explicit front tracking. In computations, however, the geometric volume enclosed by the interface -- the region where the order parameter $\phi$ is positive -- may drift at finite interface thickness, producing artificial shrinkage or growth even when the sharp-interface limit conserves volume. We revisit and extend the improved-conservation framework of Zhou et al., where one replaces classical mass conservation by the exact conservation of a designed monotone mapping $Q(\phi)$ that more accurately approximates a step function. Building on this framework, we (i) carry out the matched-asymptotic analysis in the unscaled physical time formulation, (ii) derive a simplified representation of the first-order inner correction to the interface profile, and (iii) identify an integral-moment cancellation condition that controls the leading geometric-volume defect. This mechanism becomes a practical design rule: we select regularization kernels within parameterized families -- including exponential and Pade-type -- to reach effective higher-order behavior and satisfy the cancellation condition at moderate parameter values. As a result, the proposed kernels achieve formal third-order accuracy in geometric-volume conservation with respect to interface thickness. Finally, we describe an unconditional energy-dissipative numerical discretization that exactly preserves the discrete conserved quantity. Numerical benchmarks on multi-scale droplet coarsening and shape relaxation demonstrate that the moment-balanced kernels virtually eliminate artificial drift and prevent premature extinction of small droplets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01497v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geometric Generalization of Neural Operators from Kernel Integral Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01498</link><description>arXiv:2602.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators are neural network-based surrogate models for approximating solution operators of parametric partial differential equations, enabling efficient many-query computations in science and engineering. Many applications, including engineering design, involve variable and often nonparametric geometries, for which generalization to unseen geometries remains a central practical challenge. In this work, we adopt a kernel integral perspective motivated by classical boundary integral formulations and recast operator learning on variable geometries as the approximation of geometry-dependent kernel operators, potentially with singularities. This perspective clarifies a mechanism for geometric generalization and reveals a direct connection between operator learning and fast kernel summation methods. Leveraging this connection, we propose a multiscale neural operator inspired by Ewald summation for learning and efficiently evaluating unknown kernel integrals, and we provide theoretical accuracy guarantees for the resulting approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate robust generalization across diverse geometries for several commonly used kernels and for a large-scale three-dimensional fluid dynamics example.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01498v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implementation Challenges in Quantum Key Distribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01500</link><description>arXiv:2602.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum computing technologies have steadily matured and have begun to find practical applications across various domains. One important area is network communication security, where Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables communicating parties to establish a shared secret that can then be used to generate symmetric keys for subsequent encryption and decryption. This study focuses on implementing and comparing two well-known QKD protocols, namely BB84 and E91, within an actual quantum computing environment. It also proposes the use of SX gate operations to generate uniform quantum superposition states. By leveraging the properties of quantum superposition and quantum entanglement, the study illustrates how communicating parties can securely obtain a shared secret while preventing adversaries from intercepting it. The experiments are conducted using the IBM Quantum Platform to demonstrate the feasibility of the BB84 and E91 protocols on actual quantum hardware. The evaluation considers several metrics, including entropy, Independent and Identically Distributed (IID), and error-rate verifications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal Sizing of Charging Energy Hubs for Heavy-Duty Electric Transport through Co-Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01502</link><description>arXiv:2602.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrification of heavy-duty vehicles places substantial stress on distribution grids, and Charging Energy Hubs (CEHs) mitigate these impacts by integrating charging infrastructure with renewable energy sources and battery storage. Optimal sizing of CEH components is therefore a critical investment decision, yet challenging because design choices depend strongly on operational dynamics. This work presents a mixed-integer linear programming model for the optimal sizing of CEH components, using a co-design approach that jointly optimizes component sizing and operational decisions. A case study for a heavy-duty fleet demonstrates the effectiveness of the method for cost-efficient, scalable, and grid-compliant CEH planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01502v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Governance at the Edge of Architecture: Regulating NeuroAI and Neuromorphic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01503</link><description>arXiv:2602.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current AI governance frameworks, including regulatory benchmarks for accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency, are built for static, centrally trained artificial neural networks on von Neumann hardware.

Abstract: We establish an optimal sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ for obtaining an $\epsilon$-optimal global policy using a single-timescale actor-critic (AC) algorithm in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) with finite state-action spaces, improving upon the prior state of the art of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. Our approach applies STORM (STOchastic Recursive Momentum) to reduce variance in the critic updates. However, because samples are drawn from a nonstationary occupancy measure induced by the evolving policy, variance reduction via STORM alone is insufficient. To address this challenge, we maintain a buffer of small fraction of recent samples and uniformly sample from it for each critic update. Importantly, these mechanisms are compatible with existing deep learning architectures and require only minor modifications, without compromising practical applicability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Generalization in Evolutionary Feature Construction for Symbolic Regression through Vicinal Jensen Gap Minimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01510</link><description>arXiv:2602.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic programming-based feature construction has achieved significant success in recent years as an automated machine learning technique to enhance learning performance. However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures. Comparisons with 15 machine learning algorithms further indicate that genetic programming with the proposed overfitting control strategy achieves superior performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01510v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Alternating Reinforcement Learning for Rubric-Based Reward Modeling in Non-Verifiable LLM Post-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01511</link><description>arXiv:2602.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard reward models typically predict scalar scores that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of response quality in non-verifiable domains, such as creative writing or open-ended instruction following. To address this limitation, we propose Rubric-ARM, a framework that jointly optimizes a rubric generator and a judge using reinforcement learning from preference feedback. Unlike existing methods that rely on static rubrics or disjoint training pipelines, our approach treats rubric generation as a latent action learned to maximize judgment accuracy. We introduce an alternating optimization strategy to mitigate the non-stationarity of simultaneous updates, providing theoretical analysis that demonstrates how this schedule reduces gradient variance during training. Extensive experiments show that Rubric-ARM achieves state-of-the-art performance among baselines on multiple benchmarks and significantly improves downstream policy alignment in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01511v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAPT: Model-Predictive Out-of-Distribution Detection and Failure Diagnosis for Sim-to-Real Humanoid Robots</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01515</link><description>arXiv:2602.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying learned control policies on humanoid robots is challenging: policies that appear robust in simulation can execute confidently in out-of-distribution (OOD) states after Sim-to-Real transfer, leading to silent failures that risk hardware damage. Although anomaly detection can mitigate these failures, prior methods are often incompatible with high-rate control, poorly calibrated at the extremely low false-positive rates required for practical deployment, or operate as black boxes that provide a binary stop signal without explaining why the robot drifted from nominal behavior. We present RAPT, a lightweight, self-supervised deployment-time monitor for 50Hz humanoid control. RAPT learns a probabilistic spatio-temporal manifold of nominal execution from simulation and evaluates execution-time predictive deviation as a calibrated, per-dimension signal. This yields (i) reliable online OOD detection under strict false-positive constraints and (ii) a continuous, interpretable measure of Sim-to-Real mismatch that can be tracked over time to quantify how far deployment has drifted from training. Beyond detection, we introduce an automated post-hoc root-cause analysis pipeline that combines gradient-based temporal saliency derived from RAPT's reconstruction objective with LLM-based reasoning conditioned on saliency and joint kinematics to produce semantic failure diagnoses in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate RAPT on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four complex tasks in simulation and on physical hardware. In large-scale simulation, RAPT improves True Positive Rate (TPR) by 37% over the strongest baseline at a fixed episode-level false positive rate of 0.5%. On real-world deployments, RAPT achieves a 12.5% TPR improvement and provides actionable interpretability, reaching 75% root-cause classification accuracy across 16 real-world failures using only proprioceptive data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01515v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] White-Box Neural Ensemble for Vehicular Plasticity: Quantifying the Efficiency Cost of Symbolic Auditability in Adaptive NMPC</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01516</link><description>arXiv:2602.01516v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This paper investigates data repair practices through a six-month-long ethnographic study in Bangladesh. Our interviews and field observations with data repairers and related stakeholders found that, alongside the scarcity of high-precision machinery and access to advanced software, data repair work is constrained by cross-language learning resources and the protective nature of documenting, curating, and sharing the experiences and knowledge among local peers. Repairers turning to external resources such as foreign forums and LLMs also revealed their frustrating experiences and the postcolonial ethical tensions they encountered. We noted that both anticipated technical labor and the emotionality of data were taken into account for pricing the data repair job, which contributed to their market sustainability strategies. Engaging with repair, infrastructure, and data poverty discourse, we argue that data repair practices represent a crucial challenge and opportunity for HCI in advancing global efforts toward data equity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Qrita: High-performance Top-k and Top-p Algorithm for GPUs using Pivot-based Truncation and Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01518</link><description>arXiv:2602.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top-k and Top-p are the dominant truncation operators in the sampling of large language models. Despite their widespread use, implementing them efficiently over large vocabularies remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on sorting, which incur significant computation and memory overhead on GPUs, or stochastic approaches, which alter the algorithm output. In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language. Our evaluation of Qrita against the Top-k and Top-p kernels of high performance LLM execution engines such as vLLM, SGLang, and Flashinfer show that Qrita achieves up to 2 times throughput and half memory use while providing the same output to the the sorting-based algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01518v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] You Need an Encoder for Native Position-Independent Caching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01519</link><description>arXiv:2602.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache of Large Language Models (LLMs) is prefix-based, making it highly inefficient for processing contexts retrieved in arbitrary order. Position-Independent Caching (PIC) has been proposed to enable KV reuse without positional constraints; however, existing approaches often incur substantial accuracy degradation, limiting their practical adoption. To address this issue, we propose native PIC by reintroducing the encoder to prevalent decoder-only LLMs and explicitly training it to support PIC. We further develop COMB, a PIC-aware caching system that integrates seamlessly with existing inference frameworks. Experimental results show that COMB reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 51-94% and increases throughput by 3$\times$ with comparable accuracy. Furthermore, the quality improvement when using DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat demonstrates the applicability of COMB to other types of decoder-only LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/shijuzhao/Comb.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01519v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Is Rank-1 Enough? Geometry-Guided Initialization for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01522</link><description>arXiv:2602.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a standard way to adapt multimodal large language models, yet extremely low-rank settings -- especially rank-1 LoRA -- are often unstable. We show that this instability is not solely due to limited capacity: in the rank-1 regime, optimization is highly sensitive to the update direction. Concretely, pretrained vision and text features form mismatched anisotropic regions, yielding a dominant "gap" direction that acts like a translation component and disproportionately steers early gradients under rank-1 constraints. Analyzing pretrained representations, we identify a modality-gap axis that dominates early gradient flow, while a random rank-1 initialization is unlikely to align with it, leading to weak gradients and training collapse. We propose Gap-Init, a geometry-aware initialization that aligns the rank-1 LoRA direction with an estimated modality-gap vector from a small calibration set, while keeping the initial LoRA update zero. Across multiple vision-language tasks and backbones, Gap-Init consistently stabilizes rank-1 training and can match or outperform strong rank-8 baselines. Our results suggest that at the extreme low-rank limit, initial alignment can matter as much as rank itself.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01522v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Relative-Budget Theory for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards in Large Language Model Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01523</link><description>arXiv:2602.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a dominant paradigm for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet its effectiveness varies across tasks and compute budgets. We propose a \emph{relative-budget} theory explaining this variation through a single quantity called relative budget $\xi := H/\mathbb{E}[T]$, where $H$ is the generation horizon (token budget) and $T$ denotes the number of tokens until the first correct solution under a base policy. We show that $\xi$ determines sample efficiency by controlling reward variance and the likelihood of informative trajectories. Our analysis reveals three regimes: in the \emph{deficient} regime ($\xi \to 0$), informative trajectories are rare and the sample complexity explodes; in the \emph{balanced} regime ($\xi=\Theta(1)$), informative trajectories occur with non-negligible probability and RL is maximally sample-efficient; and in the \emph{ample} regime ($\xi \to \infty$), learning remains stable but marginal gains per iteration diminish. We further provide finite-sample guarantees for online RL that characterize learning progress across these regimes. Specifically, in a case study under idealized distributional assumptions, we show that the relative budget grows linearly over iterations. Our empirical results confirm these predictions in realistic settings, identifying a budget $\xi \in [1.5, 2.0]$ that maximizes learning efficiency and coincides with peak reasoning performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01523v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Notations Evolve: A Historical Analysis with Implications for Supporting User-Defined Abstractions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01525</link><description>arXiv:2602.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional human-computer interaction takes place through formally-specified systems like structured UIs and programming languages. Recent AI systems promise a new set of informal interactions with computers through natural language and other notational forms. These informal interactions can then lead to formal representations, but depend upon pre-existing formalisms known to both humans and AI. What about novel formalisms and notations? How are new abstractions created, evolved, and incrementally formalized over time -- and how might new systems, in turn, be explicitly designed to support these processes? We conduct a comparative historical analysis of notation development to identify some relevant characteristics. These include three social stages of notation development: invention &amp; incubation, dispersion &amp; divergence, and institutionalization &amp; sanctification, as well as three functional stages: descriptive, generative, and evaluative. Within and across these stages, we detail several patterns, such as the role of linking and grounding metaphors, dimensions of meaningful variation, and analogical alignment. Finally, we offer some implications for design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01525v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Inlet Rank Collapse in Implicit Neural Representations: Diagnosis and Unified Remedy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01526</link><description>arXiv:2602.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have revolutionized continuous signal modeling, yet they struggle to recover fine-grained details within finite training budgets. While empirical techniques, such as positional encoding (PE), sinusoidal activations (SIREN), and batch normalization (BN), effectively mitigate this, their theoretical justifications are predominantly post hoc, focusing on the global NTK spectrum only after modifications are applied. In this work, we reverse this paradigm by introducing a structural diagnostic framework. By performing a layer-wise decomposition of the NTK, we mathematically identify the ``Inlet Rank Collapse'': a phenomenon where the low-dimensional input coordinates fail to span the high-dimensional embedding space, creating a fundamental rank deficiency at the first layer that acts as an expressive bottleneck for the entire network. This framework provides a unified perspective to re-interpret PE, SIREN, and BN as different forms of rank restoration. Guided by this diagnosis, we derive a Rank-Expanding Initialization, a minimalist remedy that ensures the representation rank scales with the layer width without architectural modifications or computational overhead. Our results demonstrate that this principled remedy enables standard MLPs to achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, proving that the key to empowering INRs lies in the structural optimization of the initial rank propagation to effectively populate the latent space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01526v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward a Machine Bertin: Why Visualization Needs Design Principles for Machine Cognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01527</link><description>arXiv:2602.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualization's design knowledge-effectiveness rankings, encoding guidelines, color models, preattentive processing rules -- derives from six decades of psychophysical studies of human vision. Yet vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly consume chart images in automated analysis pipelines, and a growing body of benchmark evidence indicates that this human-centered knowledge base does not straightforwardly transfer to machine audiences. Machines exhibit different encoding performance patterns, process images through patch-based tokenization rather than holistic perception, and fail on design patterns that pose no difficulty for humans-while occasionally succeeding where humans struggle. Current approaches address this gap primarily by bypassing vision entirely, converting charts to data tables or structured text. We argue that this response forecloses a more fundamental question: what visual representations would actually serve machine cognition well? This paper makes the case that the visualization field needs to investigate machine-oriented visual design as a distinct research problem. We synthesize evidence from VLM benchmarks, visual reasoning research, and visualization literacy studies to show that the human-machine perceptual divergence is qualitative, not merely quantitative, and critically examine the prevailing bypassing approach. We propose a conceptual distinction between human-oriented and machine-oriented visualization-not as an engineering architecture but as a recognition that different audiences may require fundamentally different design foundations-and outline a research agenda for developing the empirical foundations the field currently lacks: the beginnings of a "machine Bertin" to complement the human-centered knowledge the field already possesses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Making Bias Non-Predictive: Training Robust LLM Judges via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01528</link><description>arXiv:2602.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated judges, yet they remain susceptible to cognitive biases -- often altering their reasoning when faced with spurious prompt-level cues such as consensus claims or authority appeals. Existing mitigations via prompting or supervised fine-tuning fail to generalize, as they modify surface behavior without changing the optimization objective that makes bias cues predictive. To address this gap, we propose Epistemic Independence Training (EIT), a reinforcement learning framework grounded in a key principle: to learn independence, bias cues must be made non-predictive of reward. EIT operationalizes this through a balanced conflict strategy where bias signals are equally likely to support correct and incorrect answers, combined with a reward design that penalizes bias-following without rewarding bias agreement. Experiments on Qwen3-4B demonstrate that EIT improves both accuracy and robustness under adversarial biases, while preserving performance when bias aligns with truth. Notably, models trained only on bandwagon bias generalize to unseen bias types such as authority and distraction, indicating that EIT induces transferable epistemic independence rather than bias-specific heuristics.

Abstract: The paper is devoted to well-posedness analysis and the numerical solution of a family of general elliptic mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities. Various mixed variational equations, mixed variational inequalities and mixed hemivariational inequalities found in the literature are special cases of the mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities. Well-posedness of the mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities and their numerical approximations are studied via the projection iteration technique. Error analysis of the numerical methods is presented. The results are applied to the study of a variational-hemivariational inequality of the Stokes equations for incompressible fluid flows subject to slip conditions of frictional type, both monotone and non-monotone. Optimal order error estimates are derived for the use of some stable finite element space pairs under certain solution regularity assumptions. Numerical results are reported demonstrating the theoretical prediction of convergence orders.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Preserving Localized Patch Semantics in VLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01530</link><description>arXiv:2602.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logit Lens has been proposed for visualizing tokens that contribute most to LLM answers. Recently, Logit Lens was also shown to be applicable in autoregressive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where it illustrates the conceptual content of image tokens in the form of heatmaps, e.g., which image tokens are likely to depict the concept of cat in a given image. However, the visual content of image tokens often gets diffused to language tokens, and consequently, the locality of visual information gets mostly destroyed, which renders Logit Lens visualization unusable for explainability. To address this issue, we introduce a complementary loss to next-token prediction (NTP) to prevent the visual tokens from losing the visual representation inherited from corresponding image patches. The proposed Logit Lens Loss (LLL) is designed to make visual token embeddings more semantically aligned with the textual concepts that describe their image regions (e.g., patches containing a cat with the word "cat"), without requiring any architectural modification or large-scale training. This way, LLL constrains the mixing of image and text tokens in the self-attention layers in order to prevent image tokens from losing their localized visual information. As our experiments show, LLL not only makes Logit Lens practically relevant by producing meaningful object confidence maps in images, but also improves performance on vision-centric tasks like segmentation without attaching any special heads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01530v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PRISM: Festina Lente Proactivity -- Risk-Sensitive, Uncertainty-Aware Deliberation for Proactive Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01532</link><description>arXiv:2602.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proactive agents must decide not only what to say but also whether and when to intervene. Many current systems rely on brittle heuristics or indiscriminate long reasoning, which offers little control over the benefit-burden tradeoff. We formulate the problem as cost-sensitive selective intervention and present PRISM, a novel framework that couples a decision-theoretic gate with a dual-process reasoning architecture. At inference time, the agent intervenes only when a calibrated probability of user acceptance exceeds a threshold derived from asymmetric costs of missed help and false alarms. Inspired by festina lente (Latin: "make haste slowly"), we gate by an acceptance-calibrated, cost-derived threshold and invoke a resource-intensive Slow mode with counterfactual checks only near the decision boundary, concentrating computation on ambiguous and high-stakes cases. Training uses gate-aligned, schema-locked distillation: a teacher running the full PRISM pipeline provides dense, executable supervision on unlabeled interaction traces, while the student learns a response policy that is explicitly decoupled from the intervention gate to enable tunable and auditable control. On ProactiveBench, PRISM reduces false alarms by 22.78% and improves F1 by 20.14% over strong baselines. These results show that principled decision-theoretic gating, paired with selective slow reasoning and aligned distillation, yields proactive agents that are precise, computationally efficient, and controllable. To facilitate reproducibility, we release our code, models, and resources at https://prism-festinalente.github.io/; all experiments use the open-source ProactiveBench benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01532v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rotation-free Online Handwritten Character Recognition Using Linear Recurrent Units</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01533</link><description>arXiv:2602.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online handwritten character recognition leverages stroke order and dynamic features, which generally provide higher accuracy and robustness compared with offline recognition. However, in practical applications, rotational deformations can disrupt the spatial layout of strokes, substantially reducing recognition accuracy. Extracting rotation-invariant features therefore remains a challenging open problem. In this work, we employ the Sliding Window Path Signature (SW-PS) to capture local structural features of characters, and introduce the lightweight Linear Recurrent Units (LRU) as the classifier. The LRU combine the fast incremental processing capability of recurrent neural networks (RNN) with the efficient parallel training of state space models (SSM), while reliably modelling dynamic stroke characteristics. We conducted recognition experiments with random rotation angle up to $\pm 180^{\circ}$ on three subsets of the CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 dataset: digits, English upper letters, and Chinese radicals. The accuracies achieved after ensemble learning were $99.62\%$, $96.67\%$, and $94.33\%$, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SW-PS+LRU framework consistently surpasses competing models in both convergence speed and test accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01533v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Co-Design of Rover Wheels and Control using Bayesian Optimization and Rover-Terrain Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01535</link><description>arXiv:2602.01535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While simulation is vital for optimizing robotic systems, the cost of modeling deformable terrain has long limited its use in full-vehicle studies of off-road autonomous mobility. For example, Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations are often confined to single-wheel tests, which obscures coupled wheel-vehicle-controller interactions and prevents joint optimization of mechanical design and control. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization framework that co-designs rover wheel geometry and steering controller parameters using high-fidelity, full-vehicle closed-loop simulations on deformable terrain. Using the efficiency and scalability of a continuum-representation model (CRM) for terramechanics, we evaluate candidate designs on trajectories of varying complexity while towing a fixed load. The optimizer tunes wheel parameters (radius, width, and grouser features) and steering PID gains under a multi-objective formulation that balances traversal speed, tracking error, and energy consumption. We compare two strategies: simultaneous co-optimization of wheel and controller parameters versus a sequential approach that decouples mechanical and control design. We analyze trade-offs in performance and computational cost. Across 3,000 full-vehicle simulations, campaigns finish in five to nine days, versus months with the group's earlier DEM-based workflow. Finally, a preliminary hardware study suggests the simulation-optimized wheel designs preserve relative performance trends on the physical rover. Together, these results show that scalable, high-fidelity simulation can enable practical co-optimization of wheel design and control for off-road vehicles on deformable terrain without relying on prohibitively expensive DEM studies. The simulation infrastructure (scripts and models) is released as open source in a public repository to support reproducibility and further research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniDWM: Towards a Unified Driving World Model via Multifaceted Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01536</link><description>arXiv:2602.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving reliable and efficient planning in complex driving environments requires a model that can reason over the scene's geometry, appearance, and dynamics. We present UniDWM, a unified driving world model that advances autonomous driving through multifaceted representation learning. UniDWM constructs a structure- and dynamic-aware latent world representation that serves as a physically grounded state space, enabling consistent reasoning across perception, prediction, and planning. Specifically, a joint reconstruction pathway learns to recover the scene's structure, including geometry and visual texture, while a collaborative generation framework leverages a conditional diffusion transformer to forecast future world evolution within the latent space. Furthermore, we show that our UniDWM can be deemed as a variation of VAE, which provides theoretical guidance for the multifaceted representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of UniDWM in trajectory planning, 4D reconstruction and generation, highlighting the potential of multifaceted world representations as a foundation for unified driving intelligence. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Say2L/UniDWM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LMI Optimization Based Multirate Steady-State Kalman Filter Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01537</link><description>arXiv:2602.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an LMI-based design framework for multirate steady-state Kalman filters in systems with sensors operating at different sampling rates. The multirate system is formulated as a periodic time-varying system, where the Kalman gains converge to periodic steady-state values that repeat every frame period. Cyclic reformulation transforms this into a time-invariant problem; however, the resulting measurement noise covariance becomes semidefinite rather than positive definite, preventing direct application of standard Riccati equation methods. We address this through a dual LQR formulation with LMI optimization that naturally handles semidefinite covariances. The framework enables multi-objective design, supporting pole placement for guaranteed convergence rates and mixed H_2/l_2-induced norm design for balancing average and worst-case performance. Numerical validation using an automotive navigation system with GPS and wheel speed sensors demonstrates that the proposed filter achieves estimation errors well below raw measurement noise levels.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01537v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Making Avatars Interact: Towards Text-Driven Human-Object Interaction for Controllable Talking Avatars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01538</link><description>arXiv:2602.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating talking avatars is a fundamental task in video generation. Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars.

Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment is crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing defenses often lag behind evolving adversarial attacks due to their \textbf{reliance on static, pre-collected data distributions}. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{MAGIC}, a novel multi-turn multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates LLM safety alignment as an adversarial asymmetric game. Specifically, an attacker agent learns to iteratively rewrite original queries into deceptive prompts, while a defender agent simultaneously optimizes its policy to recognize and refuse such inputs. This dynamic process triggers a \textbf{co-evolution}, where the attacker's ever-changing strategies continuously uncover long-tail vulnerabilities, driving the defender to generalize to unseen attack patterns. Remarkably, we observe that the attacker, endowed with initial reasoning ability, evolves \textbf{novel, previously unseen combinatorial strategies} through iterative RL training, underscoring our method's substantial potential. Theoretically, we provide insights into a more robust game equilibrium and derive safety guarantees. Extensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating superior defense success rates without compromising the helpfulness of the model.

Abstract: Crowd counting plays a vital role in public safety, traffic regulation, and smart city management. However, despite the impressive progress achieved by CNN- and Transformer-based models, their performance often deteriorates when applied across diverse environments due to severe domain discrepancies. Direct joint training on multiple datasets, which intuitively should enhance generalization, instead results in negative transfer, as shared and domain-specific representations become entangled. To address this challenge, we propose the Feature Separation and Cross-Attention Network FSCA-Net, a unified framework that explicitly disentangles feature representations into domain-invariant and domain-specific components. A novel cross-attention fusion module adaptively models interactions between these components, ensuring effective knowledge transfer while preserving dataset-specific discriminability. Furthermore, a mutual information optimization objective is introduced to maximize consistency among domain-invariant features and minimize redundancy among domain-specific ones, promoting complementary shared-private representations. Extensive experiments on multiple crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that FSCA-Net effectively mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-world crowd analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01540v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Cognitive Supersensing in Multimodal Large Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01541</link><description>arXiv:2602.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in open-vocabulary perceptual tasks, yet their ability to solve complex cognitive problems remains limited, especially when visual details are abstract and require visual memory. Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding. We will open-source the CogSense-Bench and our model weights.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01541v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are Security Cues Static?

Abstract: Security cues, such as warnings and trust signals, are designed as stable interface elements, even though people's lives, contexts, and vulnerabilities change over time. Life transitions including migration, aging, or shifts in institutional environments reshape how risk and trust are understood and acted upon. Yet current systems rarely adapt their security cues to these changing conditions, placing the burden of interpretation on users. In this Works-in-Progress paper, we argue that the static nature of security cues represents a design mismatch with transitional human lives. We draw on prior empirical insights from work on educational migration as a motivating case, and extend the discussion to other life transitions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Transition-Aware Security Cues (TASeC) framework and present speculative design concepts illustrating how security cues might evolve across transition stages. We invite HCI to rethink security cues as longitudinal, life-centered design elements collectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeuroAI Temporal Neural Networks (NeuTNNs): Microarchitecture and Design Framework for Specialized Neuromorphic Processing Units</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01546</link><description>arXiv:2602.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leading experts from both communities have suggested the need to (re)connect research in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the development of next-generation AI innovations. They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01546v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention-weighted Centered Kernel Alignment for Knowledge Distillation in Large Audio-Language Models Applied to Speech Emotion Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01547</link><description>arXiv:2602.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) has advanced Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), but their size limits deployment in resource-constrained environments. While Knowledge Distillation is effective for LALM compression, existing methods remain underexplored in distilling the cross-modal projection module (Projector), and often struggle with alignment due to differences in feature dimensions. We propose PL-Distill, a KD framework that combines Projector-Level Distillation (PDist) to align audio embeddings and Logits-Level Distillation (LDist) to align output logits. PDist introduces Attention-weighted Centered Kernel Alignment, a novel approach we propose to highlight important time steps and address dimension mismatches. Meanwhile, LDist minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between teacher and student logits from audio and text modalities. On IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, and SAVEE, PL-Distill compresses an 8.4B-parameter teacher to a compact 1.1B-parameter student, consistently outperforming the teacher, state-of-the-art pretrained models, and other KD baselines across all metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01547v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] S1-NexusAgent: a Self-Evolving Agent Framework for Multidisciplinary Scientific Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01550</link><description>arXiv:2602.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern scientific research relies on large-scale data, complex workflows, and specialized tools, which existing LLMs and tool-based agents struggle to handle due to limitations in long-horizon planning, robust goal maintenance, and continual learning from execution. To address these issues, in this work, we propose S1-NexusAgent, a self-evolving agent framework designed for multidisciplinary scientific research. S1-NexusAgent adopts a hierarchical Plan-and-CodeAct execution paradigm, decoupling global scientific planning from subtask-level tool execution through a dual-loop architecture, thereby enabling stable modeling of complex research workflows. The system natively supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), integrates up to thousands of cross-disciplinary scientific tools, and achieves efficient orchestration of heterogeneous research tools via intention-aware dynamic tool retrieval and hot-plug mechanisms. To address long-context and large-scale data challenges in scientific settings, S1-NexusAgent introduces object-reference-based sparse context management, which enables sub-task context isolation and intermediate result compression. Building on this, a Critic Agent automatically evaluates complete execution trajectories and distills high-quality research paths into reusable Scientific Skills, forming a closed loop for continuous self-evolution, which is valuable for sustainable and long-horizon scientific research. Experiments on authoritative scientific benchmarks involving long-horizon planning and complex specialized tool orchestration, including biomini-eval (biology), ChemBench (chemistry), and MatSciBench (material science), demonstrate that S1-NexusAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generalization capability in complex scientific tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01550v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Plain Transformers are Surprisingly Powerful Link Predictors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01553</link><description>arXiv:2602.01553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is a core challenge in graph machine learning, demanding models that capture rich and complex topological dependencies. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01553v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InfoTok: Regulating Information Flow for Capacity-Constrained Shared Visual Tokenization in Unified MLLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01554</link><description>arXiv:2602.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image understanding and generation in a single framework, with the visual tokenizer acting as the sole interface that maps visual inputs into tokens for downstream tasks. However, existing shared-token designs are mostly architecture-driven and lack an explicit criterion for what information tokens should preserve to support both understanding and generation. Therefore, we introduce a capacity-constrained perspective, highlighting that in shared-token unified MLLMs the visual tokenizer behaves as a compute-bounded learner, so the token budget should prioritize reusable structure over hard-to-exploit high-entropy variations and redundancy. Motivated by this perspective, we propose InfoTok, an information-regularized visual tokenization mechanism grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. InfoTok formulates tokenization as controlling information flow from images to shared tokens to multimodal outputs, yielding a principled trade-off between compression and task relevance via mutual-information regularization. We integrate InfoTok into three representative unified MLLMs without introducing any additional training data. Experiments show consistent improvements on both understanding and generation, supporting information-regularized tokenization as a principled foundation for learning a shared token space in unified MLLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01554v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Design of Root Protograph LDPC Codes Simultaneously Achieving Full Diversity and High Coding Gain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01555</link><description>arXiv:2602.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design framework for protograph-based LDPC codes that simultaneously achieves full diversity in block-fading channels (BFCs) and nearcapacity performance in additive white Gaussian noise channels (AWGNCs). By leveraging a Boolean approximation-based analysis--Diversity Evolution (DivE)--we derive structural constraints for generalized rootchecks that guarantee full diversity. Based on these constraints, we propose a protograph template tailored for two-block BFCs. Furthermore, we employ a genetic algorithm guided by density evolution to optimize the protograph edges within this template for superior AWGNC performance. The resulting codes effectively bridge the gap between diversityoriented and capacity-oriented designs, exhibiting robust performance across both channel environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01555v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autonomous Question Formation for Large Language Model-Driven AI Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01556</link><description>arXiv:2602.01556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven AI systems are increasingly important for autonomous decision-making in dynamic and open environments. However, most existing systems rely on predefined tasks and fixed prompts, limiting their ability to autonomously identify what problems should be solved when environmental conditions change. In this paper, we propose a human-simulation-based framework that enables AI systems to autonomously form questions and set tasks by reasoning over their internal states, environmental observations, and interactions with other AI systems. The proposed method treats question formation as a first-class decision process preceding task selection and execution, and integrates internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes to progressively expand cognitive coverage. In addition, the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience, allowing the system to improve its adaptability and decision quality over time. xperimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment show that environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline, and inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation, with statistically significant improvements (p &lt; 0.05).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01556v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Implicit Bias Accumulates and Propagates in LLM Long-term Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01558</link><description>arXiv:2602.01558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term memory mechanisms enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to maintain continuity and personalization across extended interaction lifecycles, but they also introduce new and underexplored risks related to fairness. In this work, we study how implicit bias, defined as subtle statistical prejudice, accumulates and propagates within LLMs equipped with long-term memory. To support systematic analysis, we introduce the Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark, a large-scale dataset comprising 3,776 decision-making scenarios across nine social domains, designed to quantify implicit bias in long-term decision processes. Using a realistic long-horizon simulation framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs integrated with three representative memory architectures on DIB and demonstrate that LLMs' implicit bias does not remain static but intensifies over time and propagates across unrelated domains. We further analyze mitigation strategies and show that a static system-level prompting baseline provides limited and short-lived debiasing effects. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT), an agentic intervention that enforces fairness constraints at memory write time. Extensive experimental results show that DMT substantially reduces bias accumulation and effectively curtails cross-domain bias propagation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01558v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Combined Flicker-banding and Moire Removal for Screen-Captured Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01559</link><description>arXiv:2602.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing display screens with mobile devices has become increasingly common, yet the resulting images often suffer from severe degradations caused by the coexistence of moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding, leading to significant visual quality degradation. Due to the strong coupling of these two artifacts in real imaging processes, existing methods designed for single degradations fail to generalize to such compound scenarios. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on joint removal of moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding in screen-captured images, and propose a unified restoration framework, named CLEAR. To support this task, we construct a large-scale dataset containing both moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding, and introduce an ISP-based flicker simulation pipeline to stabilize model training and expand the degradation distribution. Furthermore, we design a frequency-domain decomposition and re-composition module together with a trajectory alignment loss to enhance the modeling of compound artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently. outperforms existing image restoration approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01559v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Argument Rarity-based Originality Assessment for AI-Assisted Writing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01560</link><description>arXiv:2602.01560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable of effortlessly generating high-quality text, traditional quality-focused writing assessment is losing its significance. If the essential goal of education is to foster critical thinking and original perspectives, assessment must also shift its paradigm from quality to originality. This study proposes Argument Rarity-based Originality Assessment (AROA), a framework for automatically evaluating argumentative originality in student essays. AROA defines originality as rarity within a reference corpus and evaluates it through four complementary components: structural rarity, claim rarity, evidence rarity, and cognitive depth. The framework quantifies the rarity of each component using density estimation and integrates them with a quality adjustment mechanism, thereby treating quality and originality as independent evaluation axes. Experiments using human essays and AI-generated essays revealed a strong negative correlation between quality and claim rarity, demonstrating a quality-originality trade-off where higher-quality texts tend to rely on typical claim patterns. Furthermore, while AI essays achieved comparable levels of structural complexity to human essays, their claim rarity was substantially lower than that of humans, indicating that LLMs can reproduce the form of argumentation but have limitations in the originality of content.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01560v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal UNcommonsense: From Odd to Ordinary and Ordinary to Odd</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01561</link><description>arXiv:2602.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commonsense reasoning in multimodal contexts remains a foundational challenge in artificial intelligence. We introduce Multimodal UNcommonsense(MUN), a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to handle scenarios that deviate from typical visual or contextual expectations. MUN pairs visual scenes with surprising or unlikely outcomes described in natural language, prompting models to either rationalize seemingly odd images using everyday logic or uncover unexpected interpretations in ordinary scenes. To support this task, we propose a retrieval-based in-context learning (R-ICL) framework that transfers reasoning capabilities from larger models to smaller ones without additional training. Leveraging a novel Multimodal Ensemble Retriever (MER), our method identifies semantically relevant exemplars even when image and text pairs are deliberately discordant. Experiments show an average improvement of 8.3% over baseline ICL methods, highlighting the effectiveness of R-ICL in low-frequency, atypical settings. MUN opens new directions for evaluating and improving visual-language models' robustness and adaptability in real-world, culturally diverse, and non-prototypical scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01561v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AdNanny: One Reasoning LLM for All Offline Ads Recommendation Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01563</link><description>arXiv:2602.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in Natural Language Understanding and Generation, but deploying them directly in online advertising systems is often impractical due to strict millisecond-level latency constraints. This has motivated the use of LLMs offline to improve retrieval, ranking, and recommendation models. Existing solutions typically fine-tune separate LLMs for individual tasks such as query-ad relevance labeling, keyword-based query generation, and user profiling. This results in redundant models, high maintenance cost, and limited performance gains despite substantial overlap in domain knowledge and reasoning patterns. We introduce AdNanny, a unified reasoning-centric LLM that serves as a shared backbone for offline advertising tasks. AdNanny is obtained by fine-tuning a public 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1 checkpoint using a scalable training system that supports hybrid dense-MoE parallelism. We construct reasoning-augmented corpora that pair structured supervision with step-by-step natural language explanations. A multi-task supervised fine-tuning stage with adaptive reweighting enables AdNanny to handle diverse labeling and generation tasks in a consistent reasoning format. This is followed by reinforcement learning using downstream advertising metrics to align model behavior with online retrieval and ranking objectives. AdNanny is deployed in production within Bing Ads, where it significantly reduces manual labeling effort and improves accuracy across multiple offline tasks. By consolidating many task-specific models into a single reasoning-centric foundation model, AdNanny provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale advertising systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Local Exponential Stability of Mean-Field Langevin Descent-Ascent in Wasserstein Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01564</link><description>arXiv:2602.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mean-field Langevin descent-ascent (MFL-DA), a coupled optimization dynamics on the space of probability measures for entropically regularized two-player zero-sum games. Although the associated mean-field objective admits a unique mixed Nash equilibrium, the long-time behavior of the original MFL-DA for general nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs has remained largely open. Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction. This result settles the local stability and quantitative rate questions of Wang and Chizat, leaving global convergence as a remaining open challenge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01564v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FS-Researcher: Test-Time Scaling for Long-Horizon Research Tasks with File-System-Based Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01566</link><description>arXiv:2602.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research is emerging as a representative long-horizon task for large language model (LLM) agents. However, long trajectories in deep research often exceed model context limits, compressing token budgets for both evidence collection and report writing, and preventing effective test-time scaling. We introduce FS-Researcher, a file-system-based, dual-agent framework that scales deep research beyond the context window via a persistent workspace. Specifically, a Context Builder agent acts as a librarian which browses the internet, writes structured notes, and archives raw sources into a hierarchical knowledge base that can grow far beyond context length. A Report Writer agent then composes the final report section by section, treating the knowledge base as the source of facts. In this framework, the file system serves as a durable external memory and a shared coordination medium across agents and sessions, enabling iterative refinement beyond the context window. Experiments on two open-ended benchmarks (DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult) show that FS-Researcher achieves state-of-the-art report quality across different backbone models. Further analyses demonstrate a positive correlation between final report quality and the computation allocated to the Context Builder, validating effective test-time scaling under the file-system paradigm.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression methods have achieved notable progress, delivering high perceptual quality at low bitrates. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant inference latency and heavy computational overhead, primarily due to the large number of denoising steps required during decoding. To address this problem, we propose a diffusion-based image compression method that requires only a single-step diffusion process, significantly improving inference speed. To enhance the perceptual quality of reconstructed images, we introduce a discriminator that operates on compact feature representations instead of raw pixels, leveraging the fact that features better capture high-level texture and structural details. Experimental results show that our method delivers comparable compression performance while offering a 46$\times$ faster inference speed compared to recent diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Sentence representations are foundational to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. While recent methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive sentence representations, most rely on final-layer hidden states, which are optimized for next-token prediction and thus often fail to capture global, sentence-level semantics. This paper introduces a novel perspective, demonstrating that attention value vectors capture sentence semantics more effectively than hidden states. We propose Value Aggregation (VA), a simple method that pools token values across multiple layers and token indices. In a training-free setting, VA outperforms other LLM-based embeddings, even matches or surpasses the ensemble-based MetaEOL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when paired with suitable prompts, the layer attention outputs can be interpreted as aligned weighted value vectors. Specifically, the attention scores of the last token function as the weights, while the output projection matrix ($W_O$) aligns these weighted value vectors with the common space of the LLM residual stream. This refined method, termed Aligned Weighted VA (AlignedWVA), achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free LLM-based embeddings, outperforming the high-cost MetaEOL by a substantial margin. Finally, we highlight the potential of obtaining strong LLM embedding models through fine-tuning Value Aggregation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01572v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SGHA-Attack: Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Alignment for Transferable Targeted Attacks on Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01574</link><description>arXiv:2602.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are vulnerable to transfer-based adversarial perturbations, enabling attackers to optimize on surrogate models and manipulate black-box VLM outputs. Prior targeted transfer attacks often overfit surrogate-specific embedding space by relying on a single reference and emphasizing final-layer alignment, which underutilizes intermediate semantics and degrades transfer across heterogeneous VLMs. To address this, we propose SGHA-Attack, a Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Alignment framework that adopts multiple target references and enforces intermediate-layer consistency. Concretely, we generate a visually grounded reference pool by sampling a frozen text-to-image model conditioned on the target prompt, and then carefully select the Top-K most semantically relevant anchors under the surrogate to form a weighted mixture for stable optimization guidance. Building on these anchors, SGHA-Attack injects target semantics throughout the feature hierarchy by aligning intermediate visual representations at both global and spatial granularities across multiple depths, and by synchronizing intermediate visual and textual features in a shared latent subspace to provide early cross-modal supervision before the final projection. Extensive experiments on open-source and commercial black-box VLMs show that SGHA-Attack achieves stronger targeted transferability than prior methods and remains robust under preprocessing and purification defenses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01574v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Visual Code Mobile World Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01576</link><description>arXiv:2602.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) World Models (WMs) offer a promising path for improving mobile GUI agent performance at train- and inference-time. However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01576v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DrawSim-PD: Simulating Student Science Drawings to Support NGSS-Aligned Teacher Diagnostic Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01578</link><description>arXiv:2602.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing expertise in diagnostic reasoning requires practice with diverse student artifacts, yet privacy regulations prohibit sharing authentic student work for teacher professional development (PD) at scale. We present DrawSim-PD, the first generative framework that simulates NGSS-aligned, student-like science drawings exhibiting controllable pedagogical imperfections to support teacher training. Central to our approach are apability profiles--structured cognitive states encoding what students at each performance level can and cannot yet demonstrate. These profiles ensure cross-modal coherence across generated outputs: (i) a student-like drawing, (ii) a first-person reasoning narrative, and (iii) a teacher-facing diagnostic concept map. Using 100 curated NGSS topics spanning K-12, we construct a corpus of 10,000 systematically structured artifacts. Through an expert-based feasibility evaluation, K--12 science educators verified the artifacts' alignment with NGSS expectations (&gt;84% positive on core items) and utility for interpreting student thinking, while identifying refinement opportunities for grade-band extremes. We release this open infrastructure to overcome data scarcity barriers in visual assessment research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01578v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ASafePlace: User-Led Personalization of VR Relaxation via an Art Therapy Activity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01579</link><description>arXiv:2602.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the lack of deep personalization in standard biofeedback methods, we introduce ASafePlace, a system utilizing an AI-powered, art-therapy-inspired exercise called The Safe Place, to create a personalized VR biofeedback experience. In our system, users sketch a personal sanctuary from memory, which is then transformed into a customized 360 virtual environment with personalized audio guidance for relaxation training. A study with 52 participants showed this approach effectively reduced anxiety and increased user presence, while the integration of art-therapy-inspired activity and biofeedback produced strong improvements in physiological relaxation, measured by heart rate variability and respiration rate. Qualitative results showed how participants' sense of familiarity and presence was enhanced by the symbolic elements and natural sanctuaries created from their autobiographical memories. Our findings demonstrate that art-therapy-inspired activity is a powerful tool for creating highly effective and individualized relaxation experiences, naturally connecting the virtual environment to a user's core memories and emotions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01579v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nearly Optimal Active Preference Learning and Its Application to LLM Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01581</link><description>arXiv:2602.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) depends on high-quality datasets of human preference labels, which are costly to collect. Although active learning has been studied to improve sample efficiency relative to passive collection, many existing approaches adopt classical experimental design criteria such as G- or D-optimality. These objectives are not tailored to the structure of preference learning, leaving open the design of problem-specific algorithms. In this work, we identify a simple intuition specific to preference learning that calls into question the suitability of these existing design objectives. Motivated by this insight, we propose two active learning algorithms. The first provides the first instance-dependent label complexity guarantee for this setting, and the second is a simple, practical greedy method. We evaluate our algorithm on real-world preference datasets and observe improved sample efficiency compared to existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01581v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Fragility of AI-Based Channel Decoders under Small Channel Perturbations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01582</link><description>arXiv:2602.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to AI-based error correction decoders that report empirical performance improvements over traditional belief-propagation (BP) decoding on AWGN channels. While such gains are promising, a fundamental question remains: where do these improvements come from, and what cost is paid to achieve them? In this work, we study this question through the lens of robustness to distributional shifts at the channel output. We evaluate both input-dependent adversarial perturbations (FGM and projected gradient methods under $\ell_2$ constraints) and universal adversarial perturbations that apply a single norm-bounded shift to all received vectors. Our results show that recent AI decoders, including ECCT and CrossMPT, could suffer significant performance degradation under such perturbations, despite superior nominal performance under i.i.d. AWGN. Moreover, adversarial perturbations transfer relatively strongly between AI decoders but weakly to BP-based decoders, and universal perturbations are substantially more harmful than random perturbations of equal norm. These numerical findings suggest a potential robustness cost and higher sensitivity to channel distribution underlying recent AI decoding gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Lightweight Sparse Interaction Network for Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01585</link><description>arXiv:2602.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work shows that linear models can outperform several transformer models in long-term time-series forecasting (TSF). However, instead of explicitly performing temporal interaction through self-attention, linear models implicitly perform it based on stacked MLP structures, which may be insufficient in capturing the complex temporal dependencies and their performance still has potential for improvement. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Sparse Interaction Network (LSINet) for TSF task. Inspired by the sparsity of self-attention, we propose a Multihead Sparse Interaction Mechanism (MSIM). Different from self-attention, MSIM learns the important connections between time steps through sparsity-induced Bernoulli distribution to capture temporal dependencies for TSF. The sparsity is ensured by the proposed self-adaptive regularization loss. Moreover, we observe the shareability of temporal interactions and propose to perform Shared Interaction Learning (SIL) for MSIM to further enhance efficiency and improve convergence. LSINet is a linear model comprising only MLP structures with low overhead and equipped with explicit temporal interaction mechanisms. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that LSINet achieves both higher accuracy and better efficiency than advanced linear models and transformer models in TSF tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adaptive jailbreaks that easily bypass empirical defenses like GCG. We propose a framework for certifiable robustness that shifts safety guarantees from single-pass inference to the statistical stability of an ensemble. We introduce Certified Semantic Smoothing (CSS) via Stratified Randomized Ablation, a technique that partitions inputs into immutable structural prompts and mutable payloads to derive rigorous lo norm guarantees using the Hypergeometric distribution. To resolve performance degradation on sparse contexts, we employ Noise-Augmented Alignment Tuning (NAAT), which transforms the base model into a semantic denoiser. Extensive experiments on Llama-3 show that our method reduces the Attack Success Rate of gradient-based attacks from 84.2% to 1.2% while maintaining 94.1% benign utility, significantly outperforming character-level baselines which degrade utility to 74.3%. This framework provides a deterministic certificate of safety, ensuring that a model remains robust against all adversarial variants within a provable radius.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01587v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Text Fusion: A Frequency-Aware Approach to Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01588</link><description>arXiv:2602.01588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is crucial in real-world applications, where decisions depend on both numerical data and contextual signals. The core challenge is to effectively combine temporal numerical patterns with the context embedded in other modalities, such as text. While most existing methods align textual features with time-series patterns one step at a time, they neglect the multiscale temporal influences of contextual information such as time-series cycles and dynamic shifts. This mismatch between local alignment and global textual context can be addressed by spectral decomposition, which separates time series into frequency components capturing both short-term changes and long-term trends. In this paper, we propose SpecTF, a simple yet effective framework that integrates the effect of textual data on time series in the frequency domain. Our method extracts textual embeddings, projects them into the frequency domain, and fuses them with the time series' spectral components using a lightweight cross-attention mechanism. This adaptively reweights frequency bands based on textual relevance before mapping the results back to the temporal domain for predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecTF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across diverse multi-modal time series datasets while utilizing considerably fewer parameters.

Abstract: Spherical surface parameterization is a fundamental tool in geometry processing and imaging science. For a genus-0 closed surface, many efficient algorithms can map the surface to the sphere; consequently, a broad class of task-driven genus-0 mapping problems can be reduced to constructing a high-quality spherical self-map. However, existing approaches often face a trade-off between satisfying task objectives (e.g., landmark or feature alignment), maintaining bijectivity, and controlling geometric distortion. We introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the sphere, and establish its correspondence with spherical homeomorphisms up to conformal automorphisms. Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), we propose a neural optimization framework BOOST that optimizes two Beltrami fields on hemispherical stereographic charts and enforces global consistency through explicit seam-aware constraints. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We further apply the method to brain cortical surface registration, aligning sulcal landmarks and jointly matching cortical sulci depth maps, showing improved task fidelity with controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wiki Live Challenge: Challenging Deep Research Agents with Expert-Level Wikipedia Articles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01590</link><description>arXiv:2602.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in autonomous information retrieval and report generation, showing great potential to assist humans in complex research tasks. Current evaluation frameworks primarily rely on LLM-generated references or LLM-derived evaluation dimensions. While these approaches offer scalability, they often lack the reliability of expert-verified content and struggle to provide objective, fine-grained assessments of critical dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Wiki Live Challenge (WLC), a live benchmark that leverages the newest Wikipedia Good Articles (GAs) as expert-level references. Wikipedia's strict standards for neutrality, comprehensiveness, and verifiability serve as a great challenge for DRAs, with GAs representing the pinnacle of which. We curate a dataset of 100 recent Good Articles and propose Wiki Eval, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising a fine-grained evaluation method with 39 criteria for writing quality and rigorous metrics for factual verifiability. Extensive experiments on various DRA systems demonstrate a significant gap between current DRAs and human expert-level Wikipedia articles, validating the effectiveness of WLC in advancing agent research.

Abstract: Recent advances in flow matching models, particularly with reinforcement learning (RL), have significantly enhanced human preference alignment in few step text to image generators. However, existing RL based approaches for flow matching models typically rely on numerous denoising steps, while suffering from sparse and imprecise reward signals that often lead to suboptimal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Temperature Annealed Few step Sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (TAFS GRPO), a novel framework for training flow matching text to image models into efficient few step generators well aligned with human preferences. Our method iteratively injects adaptive temporal noise onto the results of one step samples. By repeatedly annealing the model's sampled outputs, it introduces stochasticity into the sampling process while preserving the semantic integrity of each generated image. Moreover, its step aware advantage integration mechanism combines the GRPO to avoid the need for the differentiable of reward function and provide dense and step specific rewards for stable policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAFS GRPO achieves strong performance in few step text to image generation and significantly improves the alignment of generated images with human preferences. The code and models of this work will be available to facilitate further research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01591v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Samba+: General and Accurate Salient Object Detection via A More Unified Mamba-based Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01593</link><description>arXiv:2602.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing salient object detection (SOD) models are generally constrained by the limited receptive fields of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and quadratic computational complexity of Transformers. Recently, the emerging state-space model, namely Mamba, has shown great potential in balancing global receptive fields and computational efficiency. As a solution, we propose Saliency Mamba (Samba), a pure Mamba-based architecture that flexibly handles various distinct SOD tasks, including RGB/RGB-D/RGB-T SOD, video SOD (VSOD), RGB-D VSOD, and visible-depth-thermal SOD. Specifically, we rethink the scanning strategy of Mamba for SOD, and introduce a saliency-guided Mamba block (SGMB) that features a spatial neighborhood scanning (SNS) algorithm to preserve the spatial continuity of salient regions. A context-aware upsampling (CAU) method is also proposed to promote hierarchical feature alignment and aggregation by modeling contextual dependencies. As one step further, to avoid the "task-specific" problem as in previous SOD solutions, we develop Samba+, which is empowered by training Samba in a multi-task joint manner, leading to a more unified and versatile model. Two crucial components that collaboratively tackle challenges encountered in input of arbitrary modalities and continual adaptation are investigated. Specifically, a hub-and-spoke graph attention (HGA) module facilitates adaptive cross-modal interactive fusion, and a modality-anchored continual learning (MACL) strategy alleviates inter-modal conflicts together with catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Samba individually outperforms existing methods across six SOD tasks on 22 datasets with lower computational cost, whereas Samba+ achieves even superior results on these tasks and datasets by using a single trained versatile model. Additional results further demonstrate the potential of our Samba framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01593v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UV-M3TL: A Unified and Versatile Multimodal Multi-Task Learning Framework for Assistive Driving Perception</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01594</link><description>arXiv:2602.01594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) need to understand human driver behavior while perceiving their navigation context, but jointly learning these heterogeneous tasks would cause inter-task negative transfer and impair system performance. Here, we propose a Unified and Versatile Multimodal Multi-Task Learning (UV-M3TL) framework to simultaneously recognize driver behavior, driver emotion, vehicle behavior, and traffic context, while mitigating inter-task negative transfer. Our framework incorporates two core components: dual-branch spatial channel multimodal embedding (DB-SCME) and adaptive feature-decoupled multi-task loss (AFD-Loss). DB-SCME enhances cross-task knowledge transfer while mitigating task conflicts by employing a dual-branch structure to explicitly model salient task-shared and task-specific features. AFD-Loss improves the stability of joint optimization while guiding the model to learn diverse multi-task representations by introducing an adaptive weighting mechanism based on learning dynamics and feature decoupling constraints. We evaluate our method on the AIDE dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that UV-M3TL achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four tasks. To further prove the versatility, we evaluate UV-M3TL on additional public multi-task perception benchmarks (BDD100K, CityScapes, NYUD-v2, and PASCAL-Context), where it consistently delivers strong performance across diverse task combinations, attaining state-of-the-art results on most tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01594v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Art of Socratic Inquiry: A Framework for Proactive Template-Guided Therapeutic Conversation Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01598</link><description>arXiv:2602.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proactive questioning, where therapists deliberately initiate structured, cognition-guiding inquiries, is a cornerstone of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Yet, current psychological large language models (LLMs) remain overwhelmingly reactive, defaulting to empathetic but superficial responses that fail to surface latent beliefs or guide behavioral change. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Socratic Inquiry Framework (SIF)}, a lightweight, plug-and-play therapeutic intent planner that transforms LLMs from passive listeners into active cognitive guides. SIF decouples \textbf{when to ask} (via Strategy Anchoring) from \textbf{what to ask} (via Template Retrieval), enabling context-aware, theory-grounded questioning without end-to-end retraining. Complementing SIF, we introduce \textbf{Socratic-QA}, a high-quality dataset of strategy-aligned Socratic sequences that provides explicit supervision for proactive reasoning. Experiments show that SIF significantly enhances proactive questioning frequency, conversational depth, and therapeutic alignment, marking a clear shift from reactive comfort to proactive exploration. Our work establishes a new paradigm for psychologically informed LLMs: not just to respond, but to guide.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01598v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Expected Harm: Rethinking Safety Evaluation of (Mis)Aligned LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01600</link><description>arXiv:2602.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluations of LLM safety predominantly rely on severity-based taxonomies to assess the harmfulness of malicious queries. We argue that this formulation requires re-examination as it assumes uniform risk across all malicious queries, neglecting Execution Likelihood--the conditional probability of a threat being realized given the model's response. In this work, we introduce Expected Harm, a metric that weights the severity of a jailbreak by its execution likelihood, modeled as a function of execution cost. Through empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models, we reveal a systematic Inverse Risk Calibration: models disproportionately exhibit stronger refusal behaviors for low-likelihood (high-cost) threats while remaining vulnerable to high-likelihood (low-cost) queries. We demonstrate that this miscalibration creates a structural vulnerability: by exploiting this property, we increase the attack success rate of existing jailbreaks by up to $2\times$. Finally, we trace the root cause of this failure using linear probing, which reveals that while models encode severity in their latent space to drive refusal decisions, they possess no distinguishable internal representation of execution cost, making them "blind" to this critical dimension of risk.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Rollout Allocation for Online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01601</link><description>arXiv:2602.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling efficiency is a key bottleneck in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GRPO, allocate a fixed number of rollouts for all training prompts. This uniform allocation implicitly treats all prompts as equally informative, and could lead to inefficient computational budget usage and impede training progress. We introduce \Ours, a Variance-Informed Predictive allocation strategy that allocates a given rollout budget to the prompts in the incumbent batch to minimize the expected gradient variance of the policy update. At each iteration, \Ours~uses a lightweight Gaussian process model to predict per-prompt success probabilities based on recent rollouts. These probability predictions are translated into variance estimates, which are then fed into a convex optimization problem to determine the optimal rollout allocations under a hard compute budget constraint. Empirical results show that \Ours~consistently improves sampling efficiency and achieves higher performance than uniform or heuristic allocation strategies in multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, the Foundation Error Correction Code Transformer (FECCT) has emerged as a promising universal channel decoder, achieving competitive decoding performance across diverse code families by relying on a single shared model backbone, optionally followed by code-specific retraining. Despite this flexibility, the high computational complexity and large parameter footprint of transformer-based decoders present substantial obstacles to practical deployment. To address these challenges, we investigate structured pruning for FECCT and propose Spectral-Aligned Pruning (SAP), a structure-aware framework that enables cross-code reuse of structured pruning masks across codes by leveraging the spectrum of the corresponding bipartite graph. After pruning, SAP performs per-code recovery via parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling a shared pruned backbone while storing only small code-specific adapter parameters. Experiments across diverse codes show that SAP achieves decoding performance comparable to dedicated per-code pruning, while enabling substantial reductions in computational cost and model memory footprint through kernel-level structured pruning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01602v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universal Redundancies in Time Series Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01605</link><description>arXiv:2602.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) leverage extensive pretraining to accurately predict unseen time series during inference, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Through large-scale evaluations on standard benchmarks, we find that leading transformer-based TSFMs exhibit redundant components in their intermediate layers. We introduce a set of tools for mechanistic interpretability of TSFMs, including ablations of specific components and direct logit attribution on the residual stream. Our findings are consistent across several leading TSFMs with diverse architectures, and across a diverse set of real-world and synthetic time-series datasets. We discover that all models in our study are robust to ablations of entire layers. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework framing transformers as kernel regressors, motivating a purely intrinsic strategy for ablating heads based on the stable rank of the per-head projection matrices. Using this approach, we uncover the specific heads responsible for degenerate phenomena widely observed in TSFMs, such as parroting of motifs from the context and seasonality bias. Our study sheds light on the universal properties of this emerging class of architectures for continuous-time sequence modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01605v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boosting Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning via One-Step Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01606</link><description>arXiv:2602.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion policies are expressive yet incur high inference latency. Flow Matching (FM) enables one-step generation, but integrating it into Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) is challenging: the optimal policy is an intractable energy-based distribution, and the efficient log-likelihood estimation required to balance exploration and exploitation suffers from severe discretization bias. We propose \textbf{F}low-based \textbf{L}og-likelihood-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}aximum \textbf{E}ntropy RL (\textbf{FLAME}), a principled framework that addresses these challenges. First, we derive a Q-Reweighted FM objective that bypasses partition function estimation via importance reweighting. Second, we design a decoupled entropy estimator that rigorously corrects bias, which enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Third, we integrate the MeanFlow formulation to achieve expressive and efficient one-step control. Empirical results on MuJoCo show that FLAME outperforms Gaussian baselines and matches multi-step diffusion policies with significantly lower inference cost.

Abstract: Autoregressive and diffusion models represent two complementary generative paradigms. Autoregressive models excel at sequential planning and constraint composition, yet struggle with tasks that require explicit spatial or physical grounding. Diffusion models, in contrast, capture rich spatial structure through high-dimensional generation, but lack the stepwise logical control needed to satisfy complex, multi-stage constraints or to reliably identify and correct errors. We introduce Collaborative Thoughts, a unified collaborative framework that enables autoregressive and diffusion models to reason and generate jointly through a closed-loop interaction. In Collaborative Thoughts, autoregressive models perform structured planning and constraint management, diffusion models instantiate these constraints as intermediate visual thoughts, and a vision-based critic module evaluates whether the visual thoughts satisfy the intended structural and physical requirements. This feedback is then used to iteratively refine subsequent planning and generation steps, mitigating error propagation across modalities. Importantly, Collaborative Thoughts uses the same collaborative loop regardless of whether the task is autoregressive question answering or diffusion-based visual generation. Through representative examples, we illustrate how Collaborative Thoughts can improve the reliability of spatial reasoning and the controllability of generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01608v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Token Pruning for In-Context Generation in Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01609</link><description>arXiv:2602.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context generation significantly enhances Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by enabling controllable image-to-image generation through reference examples. However, the resulting input concatenation drastically increases sequence length, creating a substantial computational bottleneck. Existing token reduction techniques, primarily tailored for text-to-image synthesis, fall short in this paradigm as they apply uniform reduction strategies, overlooking the inherent role asymmetry between reference contexts and target latents across spatial, temporal, and functional dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToPi, a training-free token pruning framework tailored for in-context generation in DiTs. Specifically, ToPi utilizes offline calibration-driven sensitivity analysis to identify pivotal attention layers, serving as a robust proxy for redundancy estimation. Leveraging these layers, we derive a novel influence metric to quantify the contribution of each context token for selective pruning, coupled with a temporal update strategy that adapts to the evolving diffusion trajectory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ToPi can achieve over 30\% speedup in inference while maintaining structural fidelity and visual consistency across complex image generation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01609v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ToPT: Task-Oriented Prompt Tuning for Urban Region Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01610</link><description>arXiv:2602.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning effective region embeddings from heterogeneous urban data underpins key urban computing tasks (e.g., crime prediction, resource allocation). However, prevailing two-stage methods yield task-agnostic representations, decoupling them from downstream objectives. Recent prompt-based approaches attempt to fix this but introduce two challenges: they often lack explicit spatial priors, causing spatially incoherent inter-region modeling, and they lack robust mechanisms for explicit task-semantic alignment. We propose ToPT, a two-stage framework that delivers spatially consistent fusion and explicit task alignment. ToPT consists of two modules: spatial-aware region embedding learning (SREL) and task-aware prompting for region embeddings (Prompt4RE). SREL employs a Graphormer-based fusion module that injects spatial priors-distance and regional centrality-as learnable attention biases to capture coherent, interpretable inter-region interactions. Prompt4RE performs task-oriented prompting: a frozen multimodal large language model (MLLM) processes task-specific templates to obtain semantic vectors, which are aligned with region embeddings via multi-head cross-attention for stable task conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks and cities show state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 64.2\%, validating the necessity and complementarity of spatial priors and prompt-region alignment.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly evaluated as interactive agents, yet standard agent benchmarks conflate two qualitatively distinct sources of success: semantic tool-use and interface-specific interaction pattern memorization. Because both mechanisms can yield identical task success on the original interface, benchmark scores alone are not identifiable evidence of environment-invariant capability. We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models are limited in deployment by GPU memory and inference latency. We present Minima, a production compression pipeline that learns where and how to structurally compress a Transformer and turns that compression into real serving gains. Minima trains a lightweight convolutional predictor to estimate layer- and patch-level sensitivity, applies a mixture of Tucker, tensor-train, and tensor-ring decompositions to low-sensitivity regions, performs a short healing fine-tune, and executes the resulting operators with custom Triton and CUDA kernels. The reduced memory footprint enables speculative decoding with a small draft model and a larger verifier. On Qwen3-32B at an 8k-token context window, Minima reduces peak VRAM from 64 GiB to 40 GiB. For a single active request, throughput increases from 40 tokens per second (baseline) to 50 tokens per second (Minima) and 75 tokens per second (Minima with speculative decoding). Under 50 parallel requests, throughput is 34, 44, and 53 tokens per second respectively, showing that Minima remains effective under high concurrency even when speculative decoding gains compress. We position Minima relative to recent tensor-network, low-rank plus quantization, and cross-layer sharing methods, and argue that it is a practical step toward more aggressive structural compression via shared tensor backbones with tiny per-layer adapters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01613v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgroFlux: A Spatial-Temporal Benchmark for Carbon and Nitrogen Flux Prediction in Agricultural Ecosystems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01614</link><description>arXiv:2602.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agroecosystem, which heavily influenced by human actions and accounts for a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), plays a crucial role in mitigating global climate change and securing environmental sustainability. However, we can't manage what we can't measure. Accurately quantifying the pools and fluxes in the carbon, nutrient, and water nexus of the agroecosystem is therefore essential for understanding the underlying drivers of GHG and developing effective mitigation strategies. Conventional approaches like soil sampling, process-based models, and black-box machine learning models are facing challenges such as data sparsity, high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and complex subsurface biogeochemical and physical processes. Developing new trustworthy approaches such as AI-empowered models, will require the AI-ready benchmark dataset and outlined protocols, which unfortunately do not exist. In this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind spatial-temporal agroecosystem GHG benchmark dataset that integrates physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with real-world observations from eddy covariance flux towers and controlled-environment facilities. We evaluate the performance of various sequential deep learning models on carbon and nitrogen flux prediction, including LSTM-based models, temporal CNN-based model, and Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we explored transfer learning to leverage simulated data to improve the generalization of deep learning models on real-world observations. Our benchmark dataset and evaluation framework contribute to the development of more accurate and scalable AI-driven agroecosystem models, advancing our understanding of ecosystem-climate interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01614v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SEA-Guard: Culturally Grounded Multilingual Safeguard for Southeast Asia</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01618</link><description>arXiv:2602.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Culturally aware safeguards are crucial for AI alignment in real-world settings, where safety extends beyond common sense and encompasses diverse local values, norms, and region-specific regulations. However, building large-scale, culturally grounded datasets is challenging due to limited resources and a scarcity of native annotators. Consequently, many safeguard models rely on machine translation of English datasets, often missing regional and cultural nuances.

On this foundation, we introduce the SEA-Guard family, the first multilingual safeguard models grounded in SEA cultural contexts. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks and cultural variants, SEA-Guard consistently outperforms existing safeguards at detecting regionally sensitive or harmful content while maintaining strong general safety performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01618v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SUSD: Structured Unsupervised Skill Discovery through State Factorization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01619</link><description>arXiv:2602.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Skill Discovery (USD) aims to autonomously learn a diverse set of skills without relying on extrinsic rewards. One of the most common USD approaches is to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between skill latent variables and states. However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our experimental results across three environments, with factors ranging from 1 to 10, demonstrate that our method can discover diverse and complex skills without supervision, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised skill discovery methods in factorized and complex environments.

Abstract: Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a prominent framework for privacy-preserving machine learning, enabling inference directly on encrypted data. However, evaluating softmax, a core component of transformer architectures, remains particularly challenging in HE due to its multivariate structure, the large dynamic range induced by exponential functions, and the need for accurate division during normalization. In this paper, we propose MGF-softmax, a novel softmax reformulation based on the moment generating function (MGF) that replaces the softmax denominator with its moment-based counterpart. This reformulation substantially reduces multiplicative depth while preserving key properties of softmax and asymptotically converging to the exact softmax as the number of input tokens increases. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers and large language models show that MGF-softmax provides an efficient and accurate approximation of softmax in encrypted inference. In particular, it achieves inference accuracy close to that of high-depth exact methods, while requiring substantially lower computational cost through reduced multiplicative depth.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01621v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Omni-Judge: Can Omni-LLMs Serve as Human-Aligned Judges for Text-Conditioned Audio-Video Generation?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01623</link><description>arXiv:2602.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video generation models such as Sora 2 and Veo 3 can now produce high-fidelity videos with synchronized audio directly from a textual prompt, marking a new milestone in multi-modal generation. However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01623v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PISCES: Annotation-free Text-to-Video Post-Training via Optimal Transport-Aligned Rewards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01624</link><description>arXiv:2602.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation aims to synthesize videos with high visual quality and temporal consistency that are semantically aligned with input text. Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present $\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that $\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01624v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Enhancing Representation Learning in Federated Multi-Task Settings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01626</link><description>arXiv:2602.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated multi-task learning (FMTL) seeks to collaboratively train customized models for users with different tasks while preserving data privacy. Most existing approaches assume model congruity (i.e., the use of fully or partially homogeneous models) across users, which limits their applicability in realistic settings. To overcome this limitation, we aim to learn a shared representation space across tasks rather than shared model parameters. To this end, we propose Muscle loss, a novel contrastive learning objective that simultaneously aligns representations from all participating models. Unlike existing multi-view or multi-model contrastive methods, which typically align models pairwise, Muscle loss can effectively capture dependencies across tasks because its minimization is equivalent to the maximization of mutual information among all the models' representations. Building on this principle, we develop FedMuscle, a practical and communication-efficient FMTL algorithm that naturally handles both model and task heterogeneity. Experiments on diverse image and language tasks demonstrate that FedMuscle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering substantial improvements and robust performance across heterogeneous settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01626v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AdaptNC: Adaptive Nonconformity Scores for Uncertainty-Aware Autonomous Systems in Dynamic Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01629</link><description>arXiv:2602.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigorous uncertainty quantification is essential for the safe deployment of autonomous systems in unconstrained environments. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a distribution-free framework for this task, yet its standard formulations rely on exchangeability assumptions that are violated by the distribution shifts inherent in real-world robotics. Existing online CP methods maintain target coverage by adaptively scaling the conformal threshold, but typically employ a static nonconformity score function. We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions. We evaluate AdaptNC on diverse robotic benchmarks involving multi-agent policy changes, environmental changes and sensor degradation. Our results demonstrate that AdaptNC significantly reduces prediction region volume compared to state-of-the-art threshold-only baselines while maintaining target coverage levels.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01629v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Research on World Models Is Not Merely Injecting World Knowledge into Specific Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01630</link><description>arXiv:2602.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World models have emerged as a critical frontier in AI research, aiming to enhance large models by infusing them with physical dynamics and world knowledge. The core objective is to enable agents to understand, predict, and interact with complex environments. However, current research landscape remains fragmented, with approaches predominantly focused on injecting world knowledge into isolated tasks, such as visual prediction, 3D estimation, or symbol grounding, rather than establishing a unified definition or framework. While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose a unified design specification for world models. We suggest that a robust world model should not be a loose collection of capabilities but a normative framework that integrally incorporates interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation. This work aims to provide a structured perspective to guide future research toward more general, robust, and principled models of the world.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01630v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Closed-Form Geometric Retargeting Solver for Upper Body Humanoid Robot Teleoperation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01632</link><description>arXiv:2602.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retargeting human motion to robot poses is a practical approach for teleoperating bimanual humanoid robot arms, but existing methods can be suboptimal and slow, often causing undesirable motion or latency. This is due to optimizing to match robot end-effector to human hand position and orientation, which can also limit the robot's workspace to that of the human. Instead, this paper reframes retargeting as an orientation alignment problem, enabling a closed-form, geometric solution algorithm with an optimality guarantee. The key idea is to align a robot arm to a human's upper and lower arm orientations, as identified from shoulder, elbow, and wrist (SEW) keypoints; hence, the method is called SEW-Mimic. The method has fast inference (3 kHz) on standard commercial CPUs, leaving computational overhead for downstream applications; an example in this paper is a safety filter to avoid bimanual self-collision. The method suits most 7-degree-of-freedom robot arms and humanoids, and is agnostic to input keypoint source. Experiments show that SEW-Mimic outperforms other retargeting methods in computation time and accuracy. A pilot user study suggests that the method improves teleoperation task success. Preliminary analysis indicates that data collected with SEW-Mimic improves policy learning due to being smoother. SEW-Mimic is also shown to be a drop-in way to accelerate full-body humanoid retargeting. Finally, hardware demonstrations illustrate SEW-Mimic's practicality. The results emphasize the utility of SEW-Mimic as a fundamental building block for bimanual robot manipulation and humanoid robot teleoperation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01632v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Vision Transformer with Adaptive Focal Loss for Medical Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01633</link><description>arXiv:2602.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning models like Vision Transformer (ViT) have achieved significant advances, they typically require large datasets. With data privacy regulations, access to many original datasets is restricted, especially medical images. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by enabling global model aggregation without data exchange. However, the heterogeneity of the data and the class imbalance that exist in local clients pose challenges for the generalization of the model. This study proposes a FL framework leveraging a dynamic adaptive focal loss (DAFL) and a client-aware aggregation strategy for local training. Specifically, we design a dynamic class imbalance coefficient that adjusts based on each client's sample distribution and class data distribution, ensuring minority classes receive sufficient attention and preventing sparse data from being ignored. To address client heterogeneity, a weighted aggregation strategy is adopted, which adapts to data size and characteristics to better capture inter-client variations. The classification results on three public datasets (ISIC, Ocular Disease and RSNA-ICH) show that the proposed framework outperforms DenseNet121, ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-L/32, FedCLIP, Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and MixNet in most cases, with accuracy improvements ranging from 0.98\% to 41.69\%. Ablation studies on the imbalanced ISIC dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function and aggregation strategy compared to traditional loss functions and other FL approaches.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is a critical task across various industrial domains. However, capturing temporal dependencies and multivariate correlations within patch-level representation learning remains underexplored, and reliance on single-scale patterns limits the detection of anomalies across different temporal ranges. Furthermore, focusing on normal data representations makes models vulnerable to distribution shifts at inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Codebook-based Online-adaptive Multi-scale Embedding for Time-series anomaly detection (COMET), which consists of three key components: (1) Multi-scale Patch Encoding captures temporal dependencies and inter-variable correlations across multiple patch scales. (2) Vector-Quantized Coreset learns representative normal patterns via codebook and detects anomalies with a dual-score combining quantization error and memory distance. (3) Online Codebook Adaptation generates pseudo-labels based on codebook entries and dynamically adapts the model at inference through contrastive learning. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that COMET achieves the best performance in 36 out of 45 evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness across diverse environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01635v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Equilibrated-flux residual certification for verified existence and outputs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01636</link><description>arXiv:2602.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a post-processing certification workflow for nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems that upgrades a standard finite element computation to a rigorous existence and output certificate. For a given approximate discrete state, we verify existence and local uniqueness of a weak solution in a computable neighbourhood via a Newton--Kantorovich argument based on three certified ingredients: a guaranteed dual-norm residual bound, a computable lower bound for the stability constant of the linearised operator, and a Lipschitz bound for the derivative on the verification ball. The residual bound is obtained by an equilibrated-flux reconstruction exploiting an explicit relation between nonconforming and mixed formulations, yielding $H(\mathrm{div})$-conforming fluxes without local mixed solves. The stability ingredient follows from a computable coercivity lower bound for the linearisation. An admissible verification radius is selected by a simple bracketing--bisection search, justified for an affine Lipschitz model. Once the verification ball is certified, we derive guaranteed enclosures for quantities of interest using computable variation bounds; an adjoint-based correction, in the spirit of goal-oriented error estimation, tightens these intervals while retaining full rigour. Numerical experiments for semilinear diffusion--reaction models show that the certificates are informative and that the adjoint enhancement substantially reduces enclosure widths.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01636v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chance-Constrained Inference for Hallucination Risk Control in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01637</link><description>arXiv:2602.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models generate outputs stochastically and may produce fluent but invalid responses, including factual hallucinations. Existing mitigation strategies reduce average error rates but do not provide explicit control over the \emph{frequency} of such failures under repeated use. We formulate inference as a deployment-time risk control problem and introduce \emph{chance-constrained inference}, which directly bounds the probability of hallucinations among accepted generations. Hallucinations are modeled as stochastic constraint violations, and we show that confidence-based selective prediction does not, in general, imply probabilistic risk guarantees. To enforce chance constraints efficiently, we propose a sequential, anytime-valid inference procedure that adaptively certifies feasibility or infeasibility using finite samples, avoiding conservative fixed-sample bounds. Experiments on questions inspired by NaturalQuestions and controlled multi-hop question answering demonstrate reliable risk control, early detection of intrinsically infeasible inputs, and safe composition under repeated use, while confidence-based baselines fail to provide consistent guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01637v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReCALL: Recalibrating Capability Degradation for MLLM-based Composed Image Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01639</link><description>arXiv:2602.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images based on a hybrid query comprising a reference image and a modification text. Early dual-tower Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with cross-modality compositional reasoning required for this task. Recently, adapting generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for retrieval offers a promising direction. However, we identify that this adaptation strategy overlooks a fundamental issue: adapting a generative MLLM into a single-embedding discriminative retriever triggers a paradigm conflict, which leads to Capability Degradation - the deterioration of native fine-grained reasoning after retrieval adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose ReCALL (Recalibrating Capability Degradation), a model-agnostic framework that follows a diagnose-generate-refine pipeline: Firstly, we diagnose cognitive blind spots of the retriever via self-guided informative instance mining. Next, we generate corrective instructions and triplets by CoT prompting the foundation MLLM and conduct quality control with VQA-based consistency filtering. Finally, we refine the retriever through continual training on these triplets with a grouped contrastive scheme, thereby internalizing fine-grained visual-semantic distinctions and realigning the discriminative embedding space of retriever with intrinsic compositional reasoning within the MLLM. Extensive experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show that ReCALL consistently recalibrates degraded capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Current embodied VLM evaluation relies on static, expert-defined, manually annotated benchmarks that exhibit severe redundancy and coverage imbalance. This labor intensive paradigm drains computational and annotation resources, inflates costs, and distorts model rankings, ultimately stifling iterative development. To address this, we propose Agentic Automatic Evaluation (A2Eval), the first agentic framework that automates benchmark curation and evaluation through two collaborative agents. The Data Agent autonomously induces capability dimensions and assembles a balanced, compact evaluation suite, while the Eval Agent synthesizes and validates executable evaluation pipelines, enabling fully autonomous, high-fidelity assessment. Evaluated across 10 benchmarks and 13 models, A2Eval compresses evaluation suites by 85%, reduces overall computational costs by 77%, and delivers a 4.6x speedup while preserving evaluation quality. Crucially, A2Eval corrects systematic ranking biases, improves human alignment to Spearman's rho=0.85, and maintains high ranking fidelity (Kendall's tau=0.81), establishing a new standard for high-fidelity, low-cost embodied assessment. Our code and data will be public soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01640v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Effect of Mini-Batch Noise on the Implicit Bias of Adam</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01642</link><description>arXiv:2602.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With limited high-quality data and growing compute, multi-epoch training is gaining back its importance across sub-areas of deep learning. Adam(W), versions of which are go-to optimizers for many tasks such as next token prediction, has two momentum hyperparameters $(\beta_1, \beta_2)$ controlling memory and one very important hyperparameter, batch size, controlling (in particular) the amount mini-batch noise. We introduce a theoretical framework to understand how mini-batch noise influences the implicit bias of memory in Adam (depending on $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$) towards sharper or flatter regions of the loss landscape, which is commonly observed to correlate with the generalization gap in multi-epoch training. We find that in the case of large batch sizes, higher $\beta_2$ increases the magnitude of anti-regularization by memory (hurting generalization), but as the batch size becomes smaller, the dependence of (anti-)regulariation on $\beta_2$ is reversed. A similar monotonicity shift (in the opposite direction) happens in $\beta_1$. In particular, the commonly "default" pair $(\beta_1, \beta_2) = (0.9, 0.999)$ is a good choice if batches are small; for larger batches, in many settings moving $\beta_1$ closer to $\beta_2$ is much better in terms of validation accuracy in multi-epoch training. Moreover, our theoretical derivations connect the scale of the batch size at which the shift happens to the scale of the critical batch size. We illustrate this effect in experiments with small-scale data in the about-to-overfit regime.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01642v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] De Novo Molecular Generation from Mass Spectra via Many-Body Enhanced Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01643</link><description>arXiv:2602.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular structure generation from mass spectrometry is fundamental for understanding cellular metabolism and discovering novel compounds. Although tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) enables the high-throughput acquisition of fragment fingerprints, these spectra often reflect higher-order interactions involving the concerted cleavage of multiple atoms and bonds-crucial for resolving complex isomers and non-local fragmentation mechanisms. However, most existing methods adopt atom-centric and pairwise interaction modeling, overlooking higher-order edge interactions and lacking the capacity to systematically capture essential many-body characteristics for structure generation. To overcome these limitations, we present MBGen, a Many-Body enhanced diffusion framework for de novo molecular structure Generation from mass spectra. By integrating a many-body attention mechanism and higher-order edge modeling, MBGen comprehensively leverages the rich structural information encoded in MS/MS spectra, enabling accurate de novo generation and isomer differentiation for novel molecules. Experimental results on the NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym benchmarks demonstrate that MBGen achieves superior performance, with improvements of up to 230% over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the scientific value and practical utility of many-body modeling for mass spectrometry-based molecular generation. Further analysis and ablation studies show that our approach effectively captures higher-order interactions and exhibits enhanced sensitivity to complex isomeric and non-local fragmentation information.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01643v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Perception to Action: Spatial AI Agents and World Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01644</link><description>arXiv:2602.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01644v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Membership Inference Attack Against Music Diffusion Models via Generative Manifold Perturbation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01645</link><description>arXiv:2602.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a specific audio clip was used to train a model, making them a key tool for auditing generative music models for copyright compliance. However, loss-based signals (e.g., reconstruction error) are weakly aligned with human perception in practice, yielding poor separability at the low false-positive rates (FPRs) required for forensics. We propose the Latent Stability Adversarial Probe (LSA-Probe), a white-box method that measures a geometric property of the reverse diffusion: the minimal time-normalized perturbation budget needed to cross a fixed perceptual degradation threshold at an intermediate diffusion state. We show that training members, residing in more stable regions, exhibit a significantly higher degradation cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01645v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contribution-aware Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01649</link><description>arXiv:2602.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the redundancy of video tokens introduces significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical deployment. Many compression algorithms are proposed to prioritize retaining features with the highest attention scores to minimize perturbations in attention computations. However, the correlation between attention scores and their actual contribution to correct answers remains ambiguous. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontribution-\textbf{a}ware token \textbf{Co}mpression algorithm for \textbf{VID}eo understanding (\textbf{CaCoVID}) that explicitly optimizes the token selection policy based on the contribution of tokens to correct predictions. First, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework that optimizes a policy network to select video token combinations with the greatest contribution to correct predictions. This paradigm shifts the focus from passive token preservation to active discovery of optimal compressed token combinations. Secondly, we propose a combinatorial policy optimization algorithm with online combination space sampling, which dramatically reduces the exploration space for video token combinations and accelerates the convergence speed of policy optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CaCoVID.

Abstract: Why do neural networks fail to generalize addition from 16-digit to 32-digit numbers, while a child who learns the rule can apply it to arbitrarily long sequences? We argue that this failure is not an engineering problem but a violation of physical postulates. Drawing inspiration from physics, we identify three constraints that any generalizing system must satisfy: (1) Locality -- information propagates at finite speed; (2) Symmetry -- the laws of computation are invariant across space and time; (3) Stability -- the system converges to discrete attractors that resist noise accumulation. From these postulates, we derive -- rather than design -- the Spatiotemporal Evolution with Attractor Dynamics (SEAD) architecture: a neural cellular automaton where local convolutional rules are iterated until convergence. Experiments on three tasks validate our theory: (1) Parity -- demonstrating perfect length generalization via light-cone propagation; (2) Addition -- achieving scale-invariant inference from L=16 to L=1 million with 100% accuracy, exhibiting input-adaptive computation; (3) Rule 110 -- learning a Turing-complete cellular automaton without trajectory divergence. Our results suggest that the gap between statistical learning and logical reasoning can be bridged -- not by scaling parameters, but by respecting the physics of computation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01651v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Low-Complexity Multi-Agent Continual Learning for Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Secure Communications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01653</link><description>arXiv:2602.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), composed of multiple layers of reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces, are gaining prominence as a transformative technology for future wireless communication security. This paper investigates the integration of SIM into multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to enhance physical layer security. A novel system architecture is proposed, wherein each base station (BS) antenna transmits a dedicated single-user stream, while a multi-layer SIM executes wave-based beamforming in the electromagnetic domain, thereby avoiding the need for complex baseband digital precoding and significantly reducing hardware overhead. To maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR), we formulate a joint precoding optimization problem over BS power allocation and SIM phase shifts, which is high-dimensional and non-convex due to the complexity of the objective function and the coupling among optimization variables. To address this, we propose a manifold-enhanced heterogeneous multi-agent continual learning (MHACL) framework that incorporates gradient representation and dual-scale policy optimization to achieve robust performance in dynamic environments with high demands for secure communication. Furthermore, we develop SIM-MHACL (SIMHACL), a low-complexity learning template that embeds phase coordination into a product manifold structure, reducing the exponential search space to linear complexity while maintaining physical feasibility. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework achieves millisecond-level per-iteratio ntraining in SIM-assisted systems, significantly outperforming various baseline schemes, with SIMHACL achieving comparable WSSR to MHACL while reducing computation time by 30\%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Steering Vector Fields for Context-Aware Inference-Time Control in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01654</link><description>arXiv:2602.01654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering vectors (SVs) offer a lightweight way to control large language models (LLMs) at inference time by shifting hidden activations, providing a practical middle ground between prompting and fine-tuning. Yet SVs can be unreliable in practice. Some concepts are unsteerable, and even when steering helps on average it can backfire for a non-trivial fraction of inputs. Reliability also degrades in long-form generation and multi-attribute steering. We take a geometric view of these failures. A static SV applies the same update vector everywhere in representation space, implicitly assuming that the concept-improving direction is constant across contexts. When the locally effective direction varies with the current activation, a single global vector can become misaligned, which yields weak or reversed effects. Guided by this perspective, we propose Steering Vector Fields (SVF), which learns a differentiable concept scoring function whose local gradient defines the steering direction at each activation, making interventions explicitly context-dependent. This formulation supports coordinated multi-layer interventions in a shared, aligned concept space, and enables efficient long-form and multi-attribute control within a unified framework. Across multiple LLMs and steering tasks, SVF delivers stronger and more reliable control, improving the practicality of inference-time steering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProjDevBench: Benchmarking AI Coding Agents on End-to-End Project Development</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01655</link><description>arXiv:2602.01655v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Bandit algorithms have recently emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating machine learning models, including generative image models and large language models, by efficiently identifying top-performing candidates without exhaustive comparisons. These methods typically rely on a reward model, often distributed with public weights on platforms such as Hugging Face, to provide feedback to the bandit. While online evaluation is expensive and requires repeated trials, offline evaluation with logged data has become an attractive alternative. However, the adversarial robustness of offline bandit evaluation remains largely unexplored, particularly when an attacker perturbs the reward model (rather than the training data) prior to bandit training. In this work, we fill this gap by investigating, both theoretically and empirically, the vulnerability of offline bandit training to adversarial manipulations of the reward model. We introduce a novel threat model in which an attacker exploits offline data in high-dimensional settings to hijack the bandit's behavior. Starting with linear reward functions and extending to nonlinear models such as ReLU neural networks, we study attacks on two Hugging Face evaluators used for generative model assessment: one measuring aesthetic quality and the other assessing compositional alignment. Our results show that even small, imperceptible perturbations to the reward model's weights can drastically alter the bandit's behavior. From a theoretical perspective, we prove a striking high-dimensional effect: as input dimensionality increases, the perturbation norm required for a successful attack decreases, making modern applications such as image evaluation especially vulnerable. Extensive experiments confirm that naive random perturbations are ineffective, whereas carefully targeted perturbations achieve near-perfect attack success rates ...</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01658v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoDiQ: Test-Time Scaling for Controllable Difficult Question Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01660</link><description>arXiv:2602.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) benefit substantially from training on challenging competition-level questions. However, existing automated question synthesis methods lack precise difficulty control, incur high computational costs, and struggle to generate competition-level questions at scale. In this paper, we propose CoDiQ (Controllable Difficult Question Generation), a novel framework enabling fine-grained difficulty control via test-time scaling while ensuring question solvability. Specifically, first, we identify a test-time scaling tendency (extended reasoning token budget boosts difficulty but reduces solvability) and the intrinsic properties defining the upper bound of a model's ability to generate valid, high-difficulty questions. Then, we develop CoDiQ-Generator from Qwen3-8B, which improves the upper bound of difficult question generation, making it particularly well-suited for challenging question construction. Building on the CoDiQ framework, we build CoDiQ-Corpus (44K competition-grade question sequences). Human evaluations show these questions are significantly more challenging than LiveCodeBench/AIME with over 82% solvability. Training LRMs on CoDiQ-Corpus substantially improves reasoning performance, verifying that scaling controlled-difficulty training questions enhances reasoning capabilities. We open-source CoDiQ-Corpus, CoDiQ-Generator, and implementations to support related research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01660v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Frames to Sequences: Temporally Consistent Human-Centric Dense Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01661</link><description>arXiv:2602.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the challenge of temporally consistent human-centric dense prediction across video sequences. Existing models achieve strong per-frame accuracy but often flicker under motion, occlusion, and lighting changes, and they rarely have paired human video supervision for multiple dense tasks. We address this gap with a scalable synthetic data pipeline that generates photorealistic human frames and motion-aligned sequences with pixel-accurate depth, normals, and masks. Unlike prior static data synthetic pipelines, our pipeline provides both frame-level labels for spatial learning and sequence-level supervision for temporal learning. Building on this, we train a unified ViT-based dense predictor that (i) injects an explicit human geometric prior via CSE embeddings and (ii) improves geometry-feature reliability with a lightweight channel reweighting module after feature fusion. Our two-stage training strategy, combining static pretraining with dynamic sequence supervision, enables the model first to acquire robust spatial representations and then refine temporal consistency across motion-aligned sequences. Extensive experiments show that we achieve state-of-the-art performance on THuman2.1 and Hi4D and generalize effectively to in-the-wild videos.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01661v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgenticLab: A Real-World Robot Agent Platform that Can See, Think, and Act</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01662</link><description>arXiv:2602.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated generalizable open-vocabulary perception and reasoning, yet their real-robot manipulation capability remains unclear for long-horizon, closed-loop execution in unstructured, in-the-wild environments. Prior VLM-based manipulation pipelines are difficult to compare across different research groups' setups, and many evaluations rely on simulation, privileged state, or specially designed setups. We present AgenticLab, a model-agnostic robot agent platform and benchmark for open-world manipulation. AgenticLab provides a closed-loop agent pipeline for perception, task decomposition, online verification, and replanning. Using AgenticLab, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLM-based agents on real-robot tasks in unstructured environments. Our benchmark reveals several failure modes that offline vision-language tests (e.g., VQA and static image understanding) fail to capture, including breakdowns in multi-step grounding consistency, object grounding under occlusion and scene changes, and insufficient spatial reasoning for reliable manipulation. We will release the full hardware and software stack to support reproducible evaluation and accelerate research on general-purpose robot agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Witnessd: Proof-of-process via Adversarial Collapse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01663</link><description>arXiv:2602.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital signatures prove key possession, not authorship. An author who generates text with AI, constructs intermediate document states post-hoc, and signs each hash produces a signature chain indistinguishable from genuine composition. We address this gap between cryptographic integrity and process provenance. We introduce proof-of-process, a primitive category for evidence that a physical process, not merely a signing key, produced a digital artifact. Our construction, the jitter seal, injects imperceptible microsecond delays derived via HMAC from a session secret, keystroke ordinal, and cumulative document hash. Valid evidence requires that real keystrokes produced the document through those intermediate states. We propose the Adversarial Collapse Principle as an evaluation criterion: evidence systems should be judged by whether disputing them requires a conjunction of specific, testable allegations against components with independent trust assumptions. We present Witnessd, an architecture combining jitter seals with Verifiable Delay Functions, external timestamp anchors, dual-source keystroke validation, and optional hardware attestation. Each layer forces allegations at different capability levels; disputing authentic evidence requires coordinated claims across independent trust boundaries. The system does not prevent forgery: a kernel-level adversary can defeat it, and typing AI-generated content produces valid evidence. The contribution is converting vague doubt into falsifiable allegations. We evaluate across 31,000 verification trials with deterministic rejection of invalid proofs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01663v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlowSteer: Interactive Agentic Workflow Orchestration via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01664</link><description>arXiv:2602.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a variety of powerful agentic workflows have been applied to solve a wide range of human problems. However, existing workflow orchestration still faces key challenges, including high manual cost, reliance on specific operators/large language models (LLMs), and sparse reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose FlowSteer, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that takes a lightweight policy model as the agent and an executable canvas environment, automating workflow orchestration through multi-turn interaction. In this process, the policy model analyzes execution states and selects editing actions, while the canvas executes operators and returns feedback for iterative refinement. Moreover, FlowSteer provides a plug-and-play framework that supports diverse operator libraries and interchangeable LLM backends. To effectively train this interaction paradigm, we propose Canvas Workflow Relative Policy Optimization (CWRPO), which introduces diversity-constrained rewards with conditional release to stabilize learning and suppress shortcut behaviors. Experimental results on twelve datasets show that FlowSteer significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01664v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TABX: A High-Throughput Sandbox Battle Simulator for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01665</link><description>arXiv:2602.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of environments plays a critical role in shaping the development and evaluation of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While existing benchmarks highlight critical challenges, they often lack the modularity required to design custom evaluation scenarios. We introduce the Totally Accelerated Battle Simulator in JAX (TABX), a high-throughput sandbox designed for reconfigurable multi-agent tasks. TABX provides granular control over environmental parameters, permitting a systematic investigation into emergent agent behaviors and algorithmic trade-offs across a diverse spectrum of task complexities. Leveraging JAX for hardware-accelerated execution on GPUs, TABX enables massive parallelization and significantly reduces computational overhead. By providing a fast, extensible, and easily customized framework, TABX facilitates the study of MARL agents in complex structured domains and serves as a scalable foundation for future research.

Abstract: We introduce Lunara Aesthetic II, a publicly released, ethically sourced image dataset designed to support controlled evaluation and learning of contextual consistency in modern image generation and editing systems. The dataset comprises 2,854 anchor-linked variation pairs derived from original art and photographs created by Moonworks. Each variation pair applies contextual transformations, such as illumination, weather, viewpoint, scene composition, color tone, or mood; while preserving a stable underlying identity. Lunara Aesthetic II operationalizes identity-preserving contextual variation as a supervision signal while also retaining Lunara's signature high aesthetic scores. Results show high identity stability, strong target attribute realization, and a robust aesthetic profile that exceeds large-scale web datasets. Released under the Apache 2.0 license, Lunara Aesthetic II is intended for benchmarking, fine-tuning, and analysis of contextual generalization, identity preservation, and edit robustness in image generation and image-to-image systems with interpretable, relational supervision.

Abstract: Long-term multivariate time series forecasting (LTSF) plays a crucial role in various high-performance computing applications, including real-time energy grid management and large-scale traffic flow simulation. However, existing solutions face a dilemma: Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences, while linear State Space Models (SSMs) often struggle to distinguish valuable signals from high-frequency noise, leading to wasted state capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose ASGMamba, an efficient forecasting framework designed for resource-constrained supercomputing environments. ASGMamba integrates a lightweight Adaptive Spectral Gating (ASG) mechanism that dynamically filters noise based on local spectral energy, enabling the Mamba backbone to focus its state evolution on robust temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical multi-scale architecture with variable-specific Node Embeddings to capture diverse physical characteristics. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that ASGMamba achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. While keeping strictly $$\mathcal{O}(L)$$ complexity we significantly reduce the memory usage on long-horizon tasks, thus establishing ASGMamba as a scalable solution for high-throughput forecasting in resource limited environments.The code is available at https://github.com/hit636/ASGMamba</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01668v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Search-Augmented LLM Reasoning via Adaptive Information Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01672</link><description>arXiv:2602.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search-augmented reasoning agents interleave multi-step reasoning with external information retrieval, but uncontrolled retrieval often leads to redundant evidence, context saturation, and unstable learning. Existing approaches rely on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL), which provides limited guidance for regulating information acquisition. We propose DeepControl, a framework for adaptive information control based on a formal notion of information utility, which measures the marginal value of retrieved evidence under a given reasoning state. Building on this utility, we introduce retrieval continuation and granularity control mechanisms that selectively regulate when to continue and stop retrieval, and how much information to expand. An annealed control strategy enables the agent to internalize effective information acquisition behaviors during training. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines. In particular, our approach achieves average performance improvements of 9.4% and 8.6% on Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B, respectively, over strong outcome-based RL baselines, and consistently outperforms both retrieval-free and retrieval-based reasoning methods without explicit information control. These results highlight the importance of adaptive information control for scaling search-augmented reasoning agents to complex, real-world information environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01672v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Loop Closure Detection in Visual SLAM via NetVLAD and Faiss</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01673</link><description>arXiv:2602.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop closure detection (LCD) is a core component of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM): it identifies revisited places and enables pose-graph constraints that correct accumulated drift. Classic bag-of-words approaches such as DBoW are efficient but often degrade under appearance change and perceptual aliasing. In parallel, deep learning-based visual place recognition (VPR) descriptors (e.g., NetVLAD and Transformer-based models) offer stronger robustness, but their computational cost is often viewed as a barrier to real-time SLAM. In this paper, we empirically evaluate NetVLAD as an LCD module and compare it against DBoW on the KITTI dataset. We introduce a Fine-Grained Top-K precision-recall curve that better reflects LCD settings where a query may have zero or multiple valid matches. With Faiss-accelerated nearestneighbor search, NetVLAD achieves real-time query speed while improving accuracy and robustness over DBoW, making it a practical drop-in alternative for LCD in SLAM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01673v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TRIP-Bench: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Interactive Agents in Real-World Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01675</link><description>arXiv:2602.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLM-based agents are deployed in increasingly complex real-world settings, existing benchmarks underrepresent key challenges such as enforcing global constraints, coordinating multi-tool reasoning, and adapting to evolving user behavior over long, multi-turn interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{TRIP-Bench}, a long-horizon benchmark grounded in realistic travel-planning scenarios. TRIP-Bench leverages real-world data, offers 18 curated tools and 40+ travel requirements, and supports automated evaluation. It includes splits of varying difficulty; the hard split emphasizes long and ambiguous interactions, style shifts, feasibility changes, and iterative version revision. Dialogues span up to 15 user turns, can involve 150+ tool calls, and may exceed 200k tokens of context. Experiments show that even advanced models achieve at most 50\% success on the easy split, with performance dropping below 10\% on hard subsets. We further propose \textbf{GTPO}, an online multi-turn reinforcement learning method with specialized reward normalization and reward differencing. Applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GTPO improves constraint satisfaction and interaction robustness, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro in our evaluation. We expect TRIP-Bench to advance practical long-horizon interactive agents, and GTPO to provide an effective online RL recipe for robust long-horizon training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01675v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SMTrack: State-Aware Mamba for Efficient Temporal Modeling in Visual Tracking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01677</link><description>arXiv:2602.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual tracking aims to automatically estimate the state of a target object in a video sequence, which is challenging especially in dynamic scenarios. Thus, numerous methods are proposed to introduce temporal cues to enhance tracking robustness. However, conventional CNN and Transformer architectures exhibit inherent limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies in visual tracking, often necessitating either complex customized modules or substantial computational costs to integrate temporal cues. Inspired by the success of the state space model, we propose a novel temporal modeling paradigm for visual tracking, termed State-aware Mamba Tracker (SMTrack), providing a neat pipeline for training and tracking without needing customized modules or substantial computational costs to build long-range temporal dependencies. It enjoys several merits. First, we propose a novel selective state-aware space model with state-wise parameters to capture more diverse temporal cues for robust tracking. Second, SMTrack facilitates long-range temporal interactions with linear computational complexity during training. Third, SMTrack enables each frame to interact with previously tracked frames via hidden state propagation and updating, which releases computational costs of handling temporal cues during tracking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SMTrack achieves promising performance with low computational costs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01677v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Autonomous Instrument Tray Assembly for Sterile Processing Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01679</link><description>arXiv:2602.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sterile Processing and Distribution (SPD) department is responsible for cleaning, disinfecting, inspecting, and assembling surgical instruments between surgeries. Manual inspection and preparation of instrument trays is a time-consuming, error-prone task, often prone to contamination and instrument breakage. In this work, we present a fully automated robotic system that sorts and structurally packs surgical instruments into sterile trays, focusing on automation of the SPD assembly stage. A custom dataset comprising 31 surgical instruments and 6,975 annotated images was collected to train a hybrid perception pipeline using YOLO12 for detection and a cascaded ResNet-based model for fine-grained classification. The system integrates a calibrated vision module, a 6-DOF Staubli TX2-60L robotic arm with a custom dual electromagnetic gripper, and a rule-based packing algorithm that reduces instrument collisions during transport. The packing framework uses 3D printed dividers and holders to physically isolate instruments, reducing collision and friction during transport. Experimental evaluations show high perception accuracy and statistically significant reduction in tool-to-tool collisions compared to human-assembled trays. This work serves as the scalable first step toward automating SPD workflows, improving safety, and consistency of surgical preparation while reducing SPD processing times.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01679v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finite and Corruption-Robust Regret Bounds in Online Inverse Linear Optimization under M-Convex Action Sets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01682</link><description>arXiv:2602.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online inverse linear optimization, also known as contextual recommendation, where a learner sequentially infers an agent's hidden objective vector from observed optimal actions over feasible sets that change over time. The learner aims to recommend actions that perform well under the agent's true objective, and the performance is measured by the regret, defined as the cumulative gap between the agent's optimal values and those achieved by the learner's recommended actions. Prior work has established a regret bound of $O(d\log T)$, as well as a finite but exponentially large bound of $\exp(O(d\log d))$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem and $T$ is the time horizon, while a regret lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ is known (Gollapudi et al. 2021; Sakaue et al. 2025). Whether a finite regret bound polynomial in $d$ is achievable or not has remained an open question. We partially resolve this by showing that when the feasible sets are M-convex -- a broad class that includes matroids -- a finite regret bound of $O(d\log d)$ is possible. We achieve this by combining a structural characterization of optimal solutions on M-convex sets with a geometric volume argument. Moreover, we extend our approach to adversarially corrupted feedback in up to $C$ rounds. We obtain a regret bound of $O((C+1)d\log d)$ without prior knowledge of $C$, by monitoring directed graphs induced by the observed feedback to detect corruptions adaptively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01682v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FreshMem: Brain-Inspired Frequency-Space Hybrid Memory for Streaming Video Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01683</link><description>arXiv:2602.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitioning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) from offline to online streaming video understanding is essential for continuous perception. However, existing methods lack flexible adaptivity, leading to irreversible detail loss and context fragmentation. To resolve this, we propose FreshMem, a Frequency-Space Hybrid Memory network inspired by the brain's logarithmic perception and memory consolidation. FreshMem reconciles short-term fidelity with long-term coherence through two synergistic modules: Multi-scale Frequency Memory (MFM), which projects overflowing frames into representative frequency coefficients, complemented by residual details to reconstruct a global historical "gist"; and Space Thumbnail Memory (STM), which discretizes the continuous stream into episodic clusters by employing an adaptive compression strategy to distill them into high-density space thumbnails. Extensive experiments show that FreshMem significantly boosts the Qwen2-VL baseline, yielding gains of 5.20%, 4.52%, and 2.34% on StreamingBench, OV-Bench, and OVO-Bench, respectively. As a training-free solution, FreshMem outperforms several fully fine-tuned methods, offering a highly efficient paradigm for long-horizon streaming video understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic-aware Wasserstein Policy Regularization for Large Language Model Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01685</link><description>arXiv:2602.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly aligned with human preferences using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this method, LLM policies are generally optimized through reward maximization with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization of the reference policy. However, KL and its $f$-divergence variants only compare token probabilities at identical indices, failing to capture semantic similarity. We propose Wasserstein Policy Regularization (WPR), a semantic-aware regularization for the RLHF framework based on the entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance, which incorporates the geometry of the token space. The dual formulation of the distance expresses the regularization as penalty terms applied to the reward via optimal dual variables, which yield a tractable objective compatible with standard RL algorithms. Empirically, our method outperforms KL- and $f$-divergence-based baselines, demonstrating the benefits of semantic-aware policy distances for alignment.

Abstract: Traditional bibliography databases require users to navigate search forms and manually copy citation data. Language models offer an alternative: a natural-language interface where researchers write text with informal citation fragments, which are automatically resolved to proper references. However, language models are not reliable for scholarly work as they generate fabricated (hallucinated) citations at substantial rates.
  We present an architectural approach that combines the natural-language interface of LLM chatbots with the accuracy of direct database access, implemented through the Model Context Protocol. Our system enables language models to search bibliographic databases, perform fuzzy matching, and export verified entries, all through conversational interaction.
  A key architectural principle bypasses the language model during final data export: entries are fetched directly from authoritative sources, with timeout protection, to guarantee accuracy. We demonstrate this approach with MCP-DBLP, a server providing access to the DBLP computer science bibliography. The system transforms form-based bibliographic services into conversational assistants that maintain scholarly integrity. This architecture is adaptable to other bibliographic databases and academic data sources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01686v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Counting Hypothesis: Potential Mechanism of In-Context Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01687</link><description>arXiv:2602.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) indicates that large language models (LLMs) pretrained on a massive amount of data can learn specific tasks from input prompts' examples. ICL is notable for two reasons. First, it does not need modification of LLMs' internal structure. Second, it enables LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks/functions with a few examples demonstrating a desirable task. ICL opens up new ways to utilize LLMs in more domains, but its underlying mechanisms still remain poorly understood, making error correction and diagnosis extremely challenging. Thus, it is imperative that we better understand the limitations of ICL and how exactly LLMs support ICL. Inspired by ICL properties and LLMs' functional modules, we propose 1the counting hypothesis' of ICL, which suggests that LLMs' encoding strategy may underlie ICL, and provide supporting evidence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01687v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What LLMs Think When You Don't Tell Them What to Think About?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01689</link><description>arXiv:2602.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the behavior of large language models (LLMs) across diverse settings is critical for reliable monitoring and AI safety. However, most existing analyses rely on topic- or task-specific prompts, which can substantially limit what can be observed. In this work, we study what LLMs generate from minimal, topic-neutral inputs and probe their near-unconstrained generative behavior. Despite the absence of explicit topics, model outputs cover a broad semantic space, and surprisingly, each model family exhibits strong and systematic topical preferences. GPT-OSS predominantly generates programming (27.1%) and mathematical content (24.6%), whereas Llama most frequently generates literary content (9.1%). DeepSeek often generates religious content, while Qwen frequently generates multiple-choice questions. Beyond topical preferences, we also observe differences in content specialization and depth: GPT-OSS often generates more technically advanced content (e.g., dynamic programming) compared with other models (e.g., basic Python). Furthermore, we find that the near-unconstrained generation often degenerates into repetitive phrases, revealing interesting behaviors unique to each model family. For instance, degenerate outputs from Llama include multiple URLs pointing to personal Facebook and Instagram accounts. We release the complete dataset of 256,000 samples from 16 LLMs, along with a reproducible codebase.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01689v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GSR: Learning Structured Reasoning for Embodied Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01693</link><description>arXiv:2602.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress, embodied agents still struggle with long-horizon manipulation that requires maintaining spatial consistency, causal dependencies, and goal constraints. A key limitation of existing approaches is that task reasoning is implicitly embedded in high-dimensional latent representations, making it challenging to separate task structure from perceptual variability. We introduce Grounded Scene-graph Reasoning (GSR), a structured reasoning paradigm that explicitly models world-state evolution as transitions over semantically grounded scene graphs. By reasoning step-wise over object states and spatial relations, rather than directly mapping perception to actions, GSR enables explicit reasoning about action preconditions, consequences, and goal satisfaction in a physically grounded space. To support learning such reasoning, we construct Manip-Cognition-1.6M, a large-scale dataset that jointly supervises world understanding, action planning, and goal interpretation. Extensive evaluations across RLBench, LIBERO, GSR-benchmark, and real-world robotic tasks show that GSR significantly improves zero-shot generalization and long-horizon task completion over prompting-based baselines. These results highlight explicit world-state representations as a key inductive bias for scalable embodied reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond the Single Turn: Reframing Refusals as Dynamic Experiences Embedded in the Context of Mental Health Support Interactions with LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01694</link><description>arXiv:2602.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content Warning: This paper contains participant quotes and discussions related to mental health challenges, emotional distress, and suicidal ideation.
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet the model safeguards -- particularly refusals to engage with sensitive content -- remain poorly understood from the perspectives of users and mental health professionals (MHPs) and have been reported to cause real-world harms. This paper presents findings from a sequential mixed-methods study examining how LLM refusals are experienced and interpreted in mental health support interactions. Through surveys (N=53) and in-depth interviews (N=16) with individuals using LLMs for mental health support and MHPs, we reveal that refusals are not isolated, single-turn system behaviors, but rather constitute dynamic, multi-phase experiences: pre-refusal expectation formation, refusal triggering and encounter, refusal message framing, resource referral provision, and post-refusal outcomes. We contribute a multi-phase framework for evaluating refusals beyond binary policy compliance accuracy and design recommendations for future refusal mechanisms. These findings suggest that understanding LLM refusals requires moving beyond single-turn interactions toward recognizing them as holistic experiential processes embedded within the entire LLM design pipeline and the broader realities of mental health access.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Dense States: Elevating Sparse Transcoders to Active Operators for Latent Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01695</link><description>arXiv:2602.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent reasoning compresses the chain-of-thought (CoT) into continuous hidden states, yet existing methods rely on dense latent transitions that remain difficult to interpret and control. Meanwhile, sparse representation models uncover human-interpretable semantic features but remain largely confined to post-hoc analysis. We reconcile this tension by proposing LSTR (Latent Sparse Transcoder Reasoning), a latent reasoning framework that elevates functional sparse transcoders into active reasoning operators to perform multi-step computation through sparse semantic transitions. At its core, LSTR employs a Latent Transition Transcoder (LTT) with a residual skip architecture that decouples linear manifold transport from sparse semantic updates, enabling controllable semantic resolution via explicit sparsity constraints. Extensive experiments show that LSTR preserves reasoning accuracy and compression efficiency while substantially improving interpretability over dense latent baselines. Causal interventions and trajectory analyses further demonstrate that these sparse features act as both interpretable and causally effective operators in the reasoning process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01695v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Modal Alignment and Fusion for RGB-D Transmission-Line Defect Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01696</link><description>arXiv:2602.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission line defect detection remains challenging for automated UAV inspection due to the dominance of small-scale defects, complex backgrounds, and illumination variations. Existing RGB-based detectors, despite recent progress, struggle to distinguish geometrically subtle defects from visually similar background structures under limited chromatic contrast. This paper proposes CMAFNet, a Cross-Modal Alignment and Fusion Network that integrates RGB appearance and depth geometry through a principled purify-then-fuse paradigm. CMAFNet consists of a Semantic Recomposition Module that performs dictionary-based feature purification via a learned codebook to suppress modality-specific noise while preserving defect-discriminative information, and a Contextual Semantic Integration Framework that captures global spatial dependencies using partial-channel attention to enhance structural semantic reasoning. Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion. Extensive experiments on the TLRGBD benchmark, where 94.5% of instances are small objects, demonstrate that CMAFNet achieves 32.2% mAP@50 and 12.5% APs, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively. A lightweight variant reaches 24.8% mAP50 at 228 FPS with only 4.9M parameters, surpassing all YOLO-based detectors while matching transformer-based methods at substantially lower computational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01696v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Restoring Exploration after Post-Training: Latent Exploration Decoding for Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01698</link><description>arXiv:2602.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have recently achieved strong mathematical and code reasoning performance through Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. However, we show that modern reasoning post-training induces an unintended exploration collapse: temperature-based sampling no longer increases pass@$n$ accuracy. Empirically, the final-layer posterior of post-trained LRMs exhibit sharply reduced entropy, while the entropy of intermediate layers remains relatively high. Motivated by this entropy asymmetry, we propose Latent Exploration Decoding (LED), a depth-conditioned decoding strategy. LED aggregates intermediate posteriors via cumulative sum and selects depth configurations with maximal entropy as exploration candidates. Without additional training or parameters, LED consistently improves pass@1 and pass@16 accuracy by 0.61 and 1.03 percentage points across multiple reasoning benchmarks and models.

Abstract: Researchers at artificial intelligence labs and universities are concerned that highly capable artificial intelligence (AI) systems may erode human control by pursuing instrumental goals. Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tilt-Ropter: A Novel Hybrid Aerial and Terrestrial Vehicle with Tilt Rotors and Passive Wheels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01700</link><description>arXiv:2602.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Tilt-Ropter, a novel hybrid aerial-terrestrial vehicle (HATV) that combines tilt rotors with passive wheels to achieve energy-efficient multi-mode locomotion. Unlike existing under-actuated HATVs, the fully actuated design of Tilt-Ropter enables decoupled force and torque control, greatly enhancing its mobility and environmental adaptability. A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) is developed to track reference trajectories and handle contact constraints across locomotion modes, while a dedicated control allocation module exploits actuation redundancy to achieve energy-efficient control of actuators. Additionally, to enhance robustness during ground contact, we introduce an external wrench estimation algorithm that estimates environmental interaction forces and torques in real time. The system is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including seamless air-ground transitions and trajectory tracking. Results show low tracking errors in both modes and highlight a 92.8% reduction in power consumption during ground locomotion, demonstrating the system's potential for long-duration missions across large-scale and energy-constrained environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01700v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Meta Engine: A Unified Semantic Query Engine on Heterogeneous LLM-Based Query Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01701</link><description>arXiv:2602.01701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasingly use of multi-modal data, semantic query has become more and more demanded in data management systems, which is an important way to access and analyze multi-modal data. As unstructured data, most information of multi-modal data (text, image, video, etc) hides in the semantics, which cannot be accessed by the traditional database queries like SQL.
  Given the power of Large Language Model (LLM) in understanding semantics and processing natural language, in recent years several LLM-based semantic query systems have been proposed, to support semantic querying over unstructured data. However, this rapid growth has produced a fragmented ecosystem. Applications face significant integration challenges due to (1) disparate APIs of different semantic query systems and (2) a fundamental trade-off between specialization and generality. Many semantic query systems are highly specialized, offering state-of-the-art performance within a single modality but struggling with multi-modal data. Conversely, some "all-in-one" systems handle multiple modalities but often exhibit suboptimal performance compared to their specialized counterparts in specific modalities.
  This paper introduces Meta Engine, a novel "query system on query systems", designed to resolve those aforementioned challenges. Meta Engine is a unified semantic query engine that integrates heterogeneous, specialized LLM-based query systems. Its architecture comprises five key components: (1) a Natural Language (NL) Query Parser, (2) an Operator Generator, (3) a Query Router, (4) a set of Adapters, and (5) a Result Aggregator. In the evaluation, Meta Engine consistently outperforms all baselines, yielding 3-6x higher F1 in most cases and up to 24x on specific datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01701v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $\textbf{AGT$^{AO}$}$: Robust and Stabilized LLM Unlearning via Adversarial Gating Training with Adaptive Orthogonality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01703</link><description>arXiv:2602.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, they unintentionally memorize sensitive data, posing critical privacy and security risks. Machine unlearning is pivotal for mitigating these risks, yet existing paradigms face a fundamental dilemma: aggressive unlearning often induces catastrophic forgetting that degrades model utility, whereas conservative strategies risk superficial forgetting, leaving models vulnerable to adversarial recovery. To address this trade-off, we propose $\textbf{AGT$^{AO}$}$ (Adversarial Gating Training with Adaptive Orthogonality), a unified framework designed to reconcile robust erasure with utility preservation. Specifically, our approach introduces $\textbf{Adaptive Orthogonality (AO)}$ to dynamically mitigate geometric gradient conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives, thereby minimizing unintended knowledge degradation. Concurrently, $\textbf{Adversarial Gating Training (AGT)}$ formulates unlearning as a latent-space min-max game, employing a curriculum-based gating mechanism to simulate and counter internal recovery attempts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\textbf{AGT$^{AO}$}$ achieves a superior trade-off between unlearning efficacy (KUR $\approx$ 0.01) and model utility (MMLU 58.30).

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods improve LLM reasoning by optimizing discrete Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation; however, exploration in token space often suffers from diversity collapse as policy entropy decreases due to mode elicitation behavior in discrete RL. To mitigate this issue, we propose Latent Diffusion Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning (LaDi-RL), a framework that conducts exploration directly in a continuous latent space, where latent variables encode semantic-level reasoning trajectories. By modeling exploration via guided diffusion, multi-step denoising distributes stochasticity and preserves multiple coexisting solution modes without mutual suppression. Furthermore, by decoupling latent-space exploration from text-space generation, we show that latent diffusion-based optimization is more effective than text-space policy optimization alone, while a complementary text policy provides additional gains when combined with latent exploration. Experiments on code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both pass@1 and pass@k over discrete RL baselines, with absolute pass@1 gains of +9.4% on code generation and +5.7% on mathematical reasoning, highlighting diffusion-based latent RL as a principled alternative to discrete token-level RL for reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Curvature Preserving Fractal Interpolation Functions: A Hybrid Geometric Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01707</link><description>arXiv:2602.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal interpolation functions (FIFs) generated using iterated function systems (IFS) provide a powerful framework for modeling self-similar and irregular data, yet traditional constructions often neglect geometric fidelity such as curvature. In this paper, we introduce a curvature-preserving variant of FIFs built upon a classical cubic spline interpolant. We define a curvature-aware iterated function system (IFS) with parameters optimized via a penalty-based approach to minimize deviation from the curvature of the classical spline. Theoretical conditions for interpolation and curvature approximation are derived. We compare the curvature of the proposed FIF with that of the classical cubic spline and discrete data curvature across multiple examples. Our method achieves both data interpolation and shape fidelity, preserving curvature more accurately than standard splines. The approach has potential applications in geometric modeling, computer graphics, and scientific data interpolation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01707v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Game of Thought: Robust Information Seeking with Large Language Models Using Game Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01708</link><description>arXiv:2602.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios where they may lack sufficient information to complete a given task. In such settings, the ability to actively seek out missing information becomes a critical capability. Existing approaches to enhancing this ability often rely on simplifying assumptions that degrade \textit{worst-case} performance. This is an issue with serious implications in high-stakes applications. In this work, we use the game of Twenty Questions to evaluate the information-seeking ability of LLMs. We introduce and formalize its adversarial counterpart, the Strategic Language Search (SLS) problem along with its variants as a two-player zero-sum extensive form game. We propose Game of Thought (GoT), a framework that applies game-theoretic techniques to approximate a Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy for the restricted variant of the game. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves worst-case performance compared to (1) direct prompting-based methods and (2) heuristic-guided search methods across all tested settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01708v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARTIS: Agentic Risk-Aware Test-Time Scaling via Iterative Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01709</link><description>arXiv:2602.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current test-time scaling (TTS) techniques enhance large language model (LLM) performance by allocating additional computation at inference time, yet they remain insufficient for agentic settings, where actions directly interact with external environments and their effects can be irreversible and costly. We propose \emph{\name}, \emph{\underline{A}gentic \underline{R}isk-Aware \underline{T}est-Time Scaling via \underline{I}terative \underline{S}imulation}, a framework that decouples exploration from commitment by enabling test-time exploration through simulated interactions prior to real-world execution. This design allows extending inference-time computation to improve action-level reliability and robustness without incurring environmental risk. We further show that naive LLM-based simulators struggle to capture rare but high-impact failure modes, substantially limiting their effectiveness for agentic decision making. To address this limitation, we introduce a \emph{risk-aware tool simulator} that emphasizes fidelity on failure-inducing actions via targeted data generation and rebalanced training. Experiments on multi-turn and multi-step agentic benchmarks demonstrate that iterative simulation substantially improves agent reliability, and that risk-aware simulation is essential for consistently realizing these gains across models and tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01709v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics Informed Generative AI Enabling Labour Free Segmentation For Microscopy Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01710</link><description>arXiv:2602.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimizing Prompts for Large Language Models: A Causal Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01711</link><description>arXiv:2602.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in enterprise workflows, yet their performance remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) seeks to mitigate this instability, but existing approaches face two persistent challenges. First, commonly used prompt strategies rely on static instructions that perform well on average but fail to adapt to heterogeneous queries. Second, more dynamic approaches depend on offline reward models that are fundamentally correlational, confounding prompt effectiveness with query characteristics. We propose Causal Prompt Optimization (CPO), a framework that reframes prompt design as a problem of causal estimation. CPO operates in two stages. First, it learns an offline causal reward model by applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to semantic embeddings of prompts and queries, isolating the causal effect of prompt variations from confounding query attributes. Second, it utilizes this unbiased reward signal to guide a resource-efficient search for query-specific prompts without relying on costly online evaluation. We evaluate CPO across benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, visualization, and data analytics. CPO consistently outperforms human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art automated optimizers. The gains are driven primarily by improved robustness on hard queries, where existing methods tend to deteriorate. Beyond performance, CPO fundamentally reshapes the economics of prompt optimization: by shifting evaluation from real-time model execution to an offline causal model, it enables high-precision, per-query customization at a fraction of the inference cost required by online methods. Together, these results establish causal inference as a scalable foundation for reliable and cost-efficient prompt optimization in enterprise LLM deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01711v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedAraBench: Large-Scale Arabic Medical Question Answering Dataset and Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01714</link><description>arXiv:2602.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabic remains one of the most underrepresented languages in natural language processing research, particularly in medical applications, due to the limited availability of open-source data and benchmarks. The lack of resources hinders efforts to evaluate and advance the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce MedAraBench, a large-scale dataset consisting of Arabic multiple-choice question-answer pairs across various medical specialties. We constructed the dataset by manually digitizing a large repository of academic materials created by medical professionals in the Arabic-speaking region. We then conducted extensive preprocessing and split the dataset into training and test sets to support future research efforts in the area. To assess the quality of the data, we adopted two frameworks, namely expert human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge. Our dataset is diverse and of high quality, spanning 19 specialties and five difficulty levels. For benchmarking purposes, we assessed the performance of eight state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, such as GPT-5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 4-Sonnet. Our findings highlight the need for further domain-specific enhancements. We release the dataset and evaluation scripts to broaden the diversity of medical data benchmarks, expand the scope of evaluation suites for LLMs, and enhance the multilingual capabilities of models for deployment in clinical settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01714v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mechanistic Indicators of Steering Effectiveness in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01716</link><description>arXiv:2602.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation-based steering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to exhibit targeted behaviors by intervening on intermediate activations without retraining. Despite its widespread use, the mechanistic factors that govern when steering succeeds or fails remain poorly understood, as prior work has relied primarily on black-box outputs or LLM-based judges. In this study, we investigate whether the reliability of steering can be diagnosed using internal model signals. We focus on two information-theoretic measures: the entropy-derived Normalized Branching Factor (NBF), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between steered activations and targeted concepts in the vocabulary space. We hypothesize that effective steering corresponds to structured entropy preservation and coherent KL alignment across decoding steps. Building on a reliability study demonstrating high inter-judge agreement between two architecturally distinct LLMs, we use LLM-generated annotations as ground truth and show that these mechanistic signals provide meaningful predictive power for identifying successful steering and estimating failure probability. We further introduce a stronger evaluation baseline for Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-based steering, the two most widely adopted activation-steering methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01716v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BBPE16: UTF-16-based byte-level byte-pair encoding for improved multilingual speech recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01717</link><description>arXiv:2602.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) requires tokenization that efficiently covers many writing systems. Byte-level BPE (BBPE) using UTF-8 is widely adopted for its language-agnostic design and full Unicode coverage, but its variable-length encoding inflates token sequences for non-Latin scripts, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK). Longer sequences increase computational load and memory use. We propose BBPE16, a UTF-16-based BBPE tokenizer that represents most modern scripts with a uniform 2-byte code unit. BBPE16 preserves BBPE's language-agnostic properties while substantially improving cross-lingual token sharing. Across monolingual, bilingual, and trilingual ASR, and in a multilingual continual-learning setup, BBPE16 attains comparable or better accuracy; for Chinese, it reduces token counts by up to 10.4% and lowers decoding iterations by up to 10.3%. These reductions speed up fine-tuning and inference and decrease memory usage, making BBPE16 a practical tokenization choice for multilingual ASR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01717v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Generalization Measures Beyond IID: An Empirical Study under Distributional Shift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01718</link><description>arXiv:2602.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization remains a central yet unresolved challenge in deep learning, particularly the ability to predict a model's performance beyond its training distribution using quantities available prior to test-time evaluation. Building on the large-scale study of Jiang et al. (2020). and concerns by Dziugaite et al. (2020). about instability across training configurations, we benchmark the robustness of generalization measures beyond IID regime. We train small-to-medium models over 10,000 hyperparameter configurations and evaluate more than 40 measures computable from the trained model and the available training data alone. We significantly broaden the experimental scope along multiple axes: (i) extending the evaluation beyond the standard IID setting to include benchmarking for robustness across diverse distribution shifts, (ii) evaluating multiple architectures and training recipes, and (iii) newly incorporating calibration- and information-criteria-based measures to assess their alignment with both IID and OOD generalization. We find that distribution shifts can substantially alter the predictive performance of many generalization measures, while a smaller subset remains comparatively stable across settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01718v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] COMI: Coarse-to-fine Context Compression via Marginal Information Gain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01719</link><description>arXiv:2602.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their deployment in long context scenarios remains hindered by computational inefficiency and information redundancy. Context compression methods address these challenges by significantly reducing input length and eliminating redundancy. We propose COMI, a coarse-to-fine adaptive context compression framework that jointly optimizes for semantic relevance and diversity under high compression rates. We introduce Marginal Information Gain (MIG), a metric defined as the relevance of a unit to the input query minus its semantic redundancy with other units, guiding the compression process to prioritize information that is both relevant and low redundant. The framework operates in two stages: (1) Coarse-Grained Group Reallocation, where the context is partitioned into groups and dynamically assigned compression rates based on inter-group MIG, ensuring compression budgets align with information value distribution; and (2) Fine-Grained Token Merging, where tokens within each group are fused via an intra-group MIG-based weighting mechanism, thereby preserving key semantics while avoiding the accumulation of redundancy. Extensive experiments across question-answering (e.g., NaturalQuestions, 2WikiMQA, HotpotQA and NarrativeQA), summarization (e.g., MultiNews) with various backbones (e.g., LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen2-7B) show that COMI outperforms existing baselines by a large margin, e.g., approximately 25-point Exact Match (EM) improvement under 32x compression constraint with Qwen2-7B on NaturalQuestions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01719v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Phoenix: A Modular and Versatile Framework for C/C++ Pointer Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01720</link><description>arXiv:2602.01720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Phoenix, a modular pointer analysis framework for C/C++ that unifies multiple state-of-the-art alias analysis algorithms behind a single, stable interface. Phoenix addresses the fragmentation of today's C/C++ pointer analysis ecosystem by cleanly separating IR construction, constraint generation, solver backends, and client-facing queries, making analyses easy to compare, swap, and compose while exposing explicit precision-performance trade-offs. We evaluate Phoenix against SVF under two representative configurations: a flow- and context-insensitive setting and a more precise flow- and context-sensitive setting, on 28 GNU coreutils programs. Phoenix delivers robust speedups in the baseline configuration (up to 2.88x) and remains competitive, and often faster, even in the stronger precision regime (up to 2.91x), without a systematic runtime penalty. In production, Phoenix serves as the analysis substrate for static analysis and fuzzing tools that have uncovered hundreds of new bugs and enabled deployments reporting more than 1000 bugs found in an industrial toolchain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01720v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Pseudospectral Analysis via Low-Rank Approximations of Dynamical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01721</link><description>arXiv:2602.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudospectral analysis is fundamental for quantifying the sensitivity and transient behavior of nonnormal matrices, yet its computational cost scales cubically with dimension, rendering it prohibitive for large-scale systems. While existing research on scalable pseudospectral computation has focused on exploiting sparsity structures, common in discretizations of differential operators, these approaches are ill-suited for machine learning and data-driven dynamical systems, where operators are typically dense but approximately low-rank. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive low-rank framework that dramatically reduces this computational burden. Our core theoretical contribution is an exact characterization of the pseudospectrum of arbitrary low-rank matrices, reducing the evaluation of resolvent norms to eigenvalue problems of dimension proportional to the rank. Building on this foundation, we derive rigorous inclusion sets for the pseudospectra of general matrices via truncated and randomized low-rank approximations, with explicit perturbation bounds. These results enable efficient estimators for key stability quantities, including distance to instability and Kreiss constants, at a cost that scales with the effective rank rather than the ambient dimension. We further demonstrate how our framework naturally extends to data-driven settings, providing pseudospectral analysis of transfer operators learned from nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems. Numerical experiments confirm orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving accuracy, opening pseudospectral analysis to previously intractable high-dimensional problems in computational PDEs, control theory, and data-driven dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FastPhysGS: Accelerating Physics-based Dynamic 3DGS Simulation via Interior Completion and Adaptive Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01723</link><description>arXiv:2602.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to 4D physical simulation remains challenging. Based on the Material Point Method (MPM), existing methods either rely on manual parameter tuning or distill dynamics from video diffusion models, limiting the generalization and optimization efficiency. Recent attempts using LLMs/VLMs suffer from a text/image-to-3D perceptual gap, yielding unstable physics behavior. In addition, they often ignore the surface structure of 3DGS, leading to implausible motion. We propose FastPhysGS, a fast and robust framework for physics-based dynamic 3DGS simulation:(1) Instance-aware Particle Filling (IPF) with Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (MCIS) to efficiently populate interior particles while preserving geometric fidelity; (2) Bidirectional Graph Decoupling Optimization (BGDO), an adaptive strategy that rapidly optimizes material parameters predicted from a VLM. Experiments show FastPhysGS achieves high-fidelity physical simulation in 1 minute using only 7 GB runtime memory, outperforming prior works with broad potential applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01723v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DenVisCoM: Dense Vision Correspondence Mamba for Efficient and Real-time Optical Flow and Stereo Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01724</link><description>arXiv:2602.01724v1 Announce Type: new

Specifically, the proposed hybrid architecture is based on DenVisCoM and a Transformer-based attention block that efficiently addresses real-time inference, memory footprint, and accuracy at the same time for joint estimation of motion and 3D dense perception tasks. We extensively analyze the benchmark trade-off of accuracy and real-time processing on a large number of datasets. Our experimental results and related analysis suggest that our proposed model can accurately estimate optical flow and disparity estimation in real time.

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of Computer-using Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Domain Fake News Detection on Unseen Domains via LLM-Based Domain-Aware User Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01726</link><description>arXiv:2602.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain fake news detection (CD-FND) transfers knowledge from a source domain to a target domain and is crucial for real-world fake news mitigation. This task becomes particularly important yet more challenging when the target domain is previously unseen (e.g., the COVID-19 outbreak or the Russia-Ukraine war). However, existing CD-FND methods overlook such scenarios and consequently suffer from the following two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of high-level semantics in news and user engagements; and (2) scarcity of labeled data in unseen domains. Targeting these limitations, we find that large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for CD-FND on unseen domains, yet their effective use remains non-trivial. Nevertheless, two key challenges arise: (1) how to capture high-level semantics from both news content and user engagements using LLMs; and (2) how to make LLM-generated features more reliable and transferable for CD-FND on unseen domains. To tackle these challenges, we propose DAUD, a novel LLM-Based Domain-Aware framework for fake news detection on Unseen Domains. DAUD employs LLMs to extract high-level semantics from news content. It models users' single- and cross-domain engagements to generate domain-aware behavioral representations. In addition, DAUD captures the relations between original data-driven features and LLM-derived features of news, users, and user engagements. This allows it to extract more reliable domain-shared representations that improve knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DAUD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both general and unseen-domain CD-FND settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01726v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Voting-based Pitch Estimation with Temporal and Frequential Alignment and Correlation Aware Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01727</link><description>arXiv:2602.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The voting method, an ensemble approach for fundamental frequency estimation, is empirically known for its robustness but lacks thorough investigation. This paper provides a principled analysis and improvement of this technique. First, we offer a theoretical basis for its effectiveness, explaining the error variance reduction for fundamental frequency estimation and invoking Condorcet's jury theorem for voiced/unvoiced detection accuracy. To address its practical limitations, we propose two key improvements: 1) a pre-voting alignment procedure to correct temporal and frequential biases among estimators, and 2) a greedy algorithm to select a compact yet effective subset of estimators based on error correlation. Experiments on a diverse dataset of speech, singing, and music show that our proposed method with alignment outperforms individual state-of-the-art estimators in clean conditions and maintains robust voiced/unvoiced detection in noisy environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01727v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mutual-Guided Expert Collaboration for Cross-Subject EEG Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01728</link><description>arXiv:2602.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding the human brain from electroencephalography (EEG) signals holds promise for understanding neurological activities. However, EEG data exhibit heterogeneity across subjects and sessions, limiting the generalization of existing methods. Representation learning approaches sacrifice subject-specific information for domain invariance, while ensemble learning methods risk error accumulation for unseen subjects. From a theoretical perspective, we reveal that the applicability of these paradigms depends on the reducibility cost of domain-specific functions to domain-invariant ones. Building on this insight, we propose a Mutual-Guided Expert Collaboration (MGEC) framework that employs distinct network structures aligned with domain-specific and domain-invariant functions. Shared expert-guided learning captures reducible domain-invariant functions. Routed expert-guided learning employs a mixture-of-experts architecture to model irreducible domain-specific functions. Mutual-guided learning enables collaborative regularization to prevent over-reduction and under-reduction. We validate our theoretical findings on synthetic datasets, and experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that MGEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01728v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty-Aware Non-Prehensile Manipulation with Mobile Manipulators under Object-Induced Occlusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01731</link><description>arXiv:2602.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation using onboard sensing presents a fundamental challenge: the manipulated object occludes the sensor's field of view, creating occluded regions that can lead to collisions. We propose CURA-PPO, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses this challenge by explicitly modeling uncertainty under partial observability. By predicting collision possibility as a distribution, we extract both risk and uncertainty to guide the robot's actions. The uncertainty term encourages active perception, enabling simultaneous manipulation and information gathering to resolve occlusions. When combined with confidence maps that capture observation reliability, our approach enables safe navigation despite severe sensor occlusion. Extensive experiments across varying object sizes and obstacle configurations demonstrate that CURA-PPO achieves up to 3X higher success rates than the baselines, with learned behaviors that handle occlusions. Our method provides a practical solution for autonomous manipulation in cluttered environments using only onboard sensing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01731v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MSign: An Optimizer Preventing Training Instability in Large Language Models via Stable Rank Restoration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01734</link><description>arXiv:2602.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training instability remains a critical challenge in large language model (LLM) pretraining, often manifesting as sudden gradient explosions that waste significant computational resources. We study training failures in a 5M-parameter NanoGPT model scaled via $\mu$P, identifying two key phenomena preceding collapse: (1) rapid decline in weight matrix stable rank (ratio of squared Frobenius norm to squared spectral norm), and (2) increasing alignment between adjacent layer Jacobians. We prove theoretically that these two conditions jointly cause exponential gradient norm growth with network depth. To break this instability mechanism, we propose MSign, a new optimizer that periodically applies matrix sign operations to restore stable rank. Experiments on models from 5M to 3B parameters demonstrate that MSign effectively prevents training failures with a computational overhead of less than 7.0%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01734v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: The Inevitable End of One-Architecture-Fits-All-Domains in Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01736</link><description>arXiv:2602.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has questioned the effectiveness and robustness of neural network architectures for time series forecasting tasks. We summarize these concerns and analyze groundly their inherent limitations: i.e. the irreconcilable conflict between single (or few similar) domains SOTA and generalizability over general domains for time series forecasting neural network architecture designs. Moreover, neural networks architectures for general domain time series forecasting are becoming more and more complicated and their performance has almost saturated in recent years. As a result, network architectures developed aiming at fitting general time series domains are almost not inspiring for real world practices for certain single (or few similar) domains such as Finance, Weather, Traffic, etc: each specific domain develops their own methods that rarely utilize advances in neural network architectures of time series community in recent 2-3 years. As a result, we call for the time series community to shift focus away from research on time series neural network architectures for general domains: these researches have become saturated and away from domain-specific SOTAs over time. We should either (1) focus on deep learning methods for certain specific domain(s), or (2) turn to the development of meta-learning methods for general domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01736v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simplicity Prevails: The Emergence of Generalizable AIGI Detection in Visual Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01738</link><description>arXiv:2602.01738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-Generated Images (AIGI) achieve near-perfect accuracy on curated benchmarks, they suffer from a dramatic performance collapse in realistic, in-the-wild scenarios. In this work, we demonstrate that simplicity prevails over complex architectural designs. A simple linear classifier trained on the frozen features of modern Vision Foundation Models , including Perception Encoder, MetaCLIP 2, and DINOv3, establishes a new state-of-the-art. Through a comprehensive evaluation spanning traditional benchmarks, unseen generators, and challenging in-the-wild distributions, we show that this baseline not only matches specialized detectors on standard benchmarks but also decisively outperforms them on in-the-wild datasets, boosting accuracy by striking margins of over 30\%. We posit that this superior capability is an emergent property driven by the massive scale of pre-training data containing synthetic content. We trace the source of this capability to two distinct manifestations of data exposure: Vision-Language Models internalize an explicit semantic concept of forgery, while Self-Supervised Learning models implicitly acquire discriminative forensic features from the pretraining data. However, we also reveal persistent limitations: these models suffer from performance degradation under recapture and transmission, remain blind to VAE reconstruction and localized editing. We conclude by advocating for a paradigm shift in AI forensics, moving from overfitting on static benchmarks to harnessing the evolving world knowledge of foundation models for real-world reliability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01738v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MACD: Model-Aware Contrastive Decoding via Counterfactual Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01740</link><description>arXiv:2602.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video language models (Video-LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, often generating plausible but ungrounded content when visual evidence is weak, ambiguous, or biased. Existing decoding methods, such as contrastive decoding (CD), rely on random perturbations to construct contrastive data for mitigating hallucination patterns. However, such a way is hard to control the visual cues that drive hallucination or well align with model weaknesses. We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding. Experiments on EventHallusion, MVBench, Perception-test and Video-MME show that MACD consistently reduces hallucination while maintaining or improving task accuracy across diverse Video-LLMs, including Qwen and InternVL families. The method is especially effective in challenging scenarios involving small, occluded, or co-occurring objects. Our code and data will be publicly released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01740v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tail-Aware Post-Training Quantization for 3D Geometry Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01741</link><description>arXiv:2602.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning complexity and scale of 3D geometry models pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference without retraining, conventional methods, primarily optimized for 2D Vision Transformers, fail to transfer effectively to 3D models due to intricate feature distributions and prohibitive calibration overhead. To address these challenges, we propose TAPTQ, a Tail-Aware Post-Training Quantization pipeline specifically engineered for 3D geometric learning. Our contribution is threefold: (1) To overcome the data-scale bottleneck in 3D datasets, we develop a progressive coarse-to-fine calibration construction strategy that constructs a highly compact subset to achieve both statistical purity and geometric representativeness. (2) We reformulate the quantization interval search as an optimization problem and introduce a ternary-search-based solver, reducing the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ for accelerated deployment. (3) To mitigate quantization error accumulation, we propose TRE-Guided Module-wise Compensation, which utilizes a Tail Relative Error (TRE) metric to adaptively identify and rectify distortions in modules sensitive to long-tailed activation outliers. Extensive experiments on the VGGT and Pi3 benchmarks demonstrate that TAPTQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods in accuracy while significantly reducing calibration time. The code will be released soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01741v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Softmax Linear Attention: Reclaiming Global Competition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01744</link><description>arXiv:2602.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While linear attention reduces the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers to linear time, it often lags behind in expressivity due to the removal of softmax normalization. This omission eliminates \emph{global competition}, a critical mechanism that enables models to sharply focus on relevant information amidst long-context noise. In this work, we propose \textbf{Softmax Linear Attention (SLA)}, a framework designed to restore this competitive selection without sacrificing efficiency. By lifting the softmax operation from the token level to the head level, SLA leverages attention heads as coarse semantic slots, applying a competitive gating mechanism to dynamically select the most relevant subspaces. This reintroduces the ``winner-take-all'' dynamics essential for precise retrieval and robust long-context understanding. Distinct from prior methods that focus on refining local kernel functions, SLA adopts a broader perspective by exploiting the higher-level multi-head aggregation structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLA consistently enhances state-of-the-art linear baselines (RetNet, GLA, GDN) across language modeling and long-context benchmarks, particularly in challenging retrieval scenarios where it significantly boosts robustness against noise, validating its capability to restore precise focus while maintaining linear complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probability-Entropy Calibration: An Elastic Indicator for Adaptive Fine-tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01745</link><description>arXiv:2602.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Token-level reweighting is a simple yet effective mechanism for controlling supervised fine-tuning, but common indicators are largely one-dimensional: the ground-truth probability reflects downstream alignment, while token entropy reflects intrinsic uncertainty induced by the pre-training prior. Ignoring entropy can misidentify noisy or easily replaceable tokens as learning-critical, while ignoring probability fails to reflect target-specific alignment. RankTuner introduces a probability--entropy calibration signal, the Relative Rank Indicator, which compares the rank of the ground-truth token with its expected rank under the prediction distribution. The inverse indicator is used as a token-wise Relative Scale to reweight the fine-tuning objective, focusing updates on truly under-learned tokens without over-penalizing intrinsically uncertain positions. Experiments on multiple backbones show consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, transfer gains on out-of-distribution reasoning, and pre code generation performance over probability-only or entropy-only reweighting baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01745v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking LoRA for Data Heterogeneous Federated Learning: Subspace and State Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01746</link><description>arXiv:2602.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used for federated fine-tuning. Yet under non-IID settings, it can substantially underperform full-parameter fine-tuning. Through with-high-probability robustness analysis, we uncover that this gap can be attributed to two coupled mismatches: (i) update-space mismatch, where clients optimize in a low-rank subspace but aggregation occurs in the full space; and (ii) optimizer-state mismatch, where unsynchronized adaptive states amplify drift across rounds. We propose FedGaLore, which combines client-side GaLore-style gradient-subspace optimization with server-side drift-robust synchronization of projected second-moment states via spectral shared-signal extraction, to address this challenge. Across NLU, vision, and NLG benchmarks, FedGaLore improves robustness and accuracy over state-of-the-art federated LoRA baselines in non-IID settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01746v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Automated Essay Scoring with Three Techniques: Two-Stage Fine-Tuning, Score Alignment, and Self-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01747</link><description>arXiv:2602.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) plays a crucial role in education by providing scalable and efficient assessment tools. However, in real-world settings, the extreme scarcity of labeled data severely limits the development and practical adoption of robust AES systems. This study proposes a novel approach to enhance AES performance in both limited-data and full-data settings by introducing three key techniques. First, we introduce a Two-Stage fine-tuning strategy that leverages low-rank adaptations to better adapt an AES model to target prompt essays. Second, we introduce a Score Alignment technique to improve consistency between predicted and true score distributions. Third, we employ uncertainty-aware self-training using unlabeled data, effectively expanding the training set with pseudo-labeled samples while mitigating label noise propagation. We implement above three key techniques on DualBERT. We conduct extensive experiments on the ASAP++ dataset. As a result, in the 32-data setting, all three key techniques improve performance, and their integration achieves 91.2% of the full-data performance trained on approximately 1,000 labeled samples. In addition, the proposed Score Alignment technique consistently improves performance in both limited-data and full-data settings: e.g., it achieves state-of-the-art results in the full-data setting when integrated into DualBERT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OFERA: Blendshape-driven 3D Gaussian Control for Occluded Facial Expression to Realistic Avatars in VR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01748</link><description>arXiv:2602.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose OFERA, a novel framework for real-time expression control of photorealistic Gaussian head avatars for VR headset users. Existing approaches attempt to recover occluded facial expressions using additional sensors or internal cameras, but sensor-based methods increase device weight and discomfort, while camera-based methods raise privacy concerns and suffer from limited access to raw data. To overcome these limitations, we leverage the blendshape signals provided by commercial VR headsets as expression inputs. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) Blendshape Distribution Alignment (BDA), which applies linear regression to align the headset-provided blendshape distribution to a canonical input space; (2) an Expression Parameter Mapper (EPM) that maps the aligned blendshape signals into an expression parameter space for controlling Gaussian head avatars; and (3) a Mapper-integrated Avatar (MiA) that incorporates EPM into the avatar learning process to ensure distributional consistency. Furthermore, OFERA establishes an end-to-end pipeline that senses and maps expressions, updates Gaussian avatars, and renders them in real-time within VR environments. We show that EPM outperforms existing mapping methods on quantitative metrics, and we demonstrate through a user study that the full OFERA framework enhances expression fidelity while preserving avatar realism. By enabling real-time and photorealistic avatar expression control, OFERA significantly improves telepresence in VR communication.

Abstract: Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objectives implicitly fix an equal mixing of forward and backward policies, potentially constraining the exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. By further exploring the link between GFlowNets and Markov chains, we establish an equivalence between GFlowNet objectives and Markov chain reversibility, thereby revealing the origin of such constraints, and provide a framework for adapting Markov chain properties to GFlowNets. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose $\alpha$-GFNs, which generalize the mixing via a tunable parameter $\alpha$. This generalization enables direct control over exploration-exploitation dynamics to enhance mode discovery capabilities, while ensuring convergence to unique flows. Across various benchmarks, including Set, Bit Sequence, and Molecule Generation, $\alpha$-GFN objectives consistently outperform previous GFlowNet objectives, achieving up to a $10 \times$ increase in the number of discovered modes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Reward Auditing for Active Detection and Mitigation of Reward Hacking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01750</link><description>arXiv:2602.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where models exploit spurious correlations in learned reward models to achieve high scores while violating human intent. Existing mitigations rely on static defenses that cannot adapt to novel exploitation strategies. We propose Adversarial Reward Auditing (ARA), a framework that reconceptualizes reward hacking as a dynamic, competitive game. ARA operates in two stages: first, a Hacker policy discovers reward model vulnerabilities while an Auditor learns to detect exploitation from latent representations; second, Auditor-Guided RLHF (AG-RLHF) gates reward signals to penalize detected hacking, transforming reward hacking from an unobservable failure into a measurable, controllable signal. Experiments across three hacking scenarios demonstrate that ARA achieves the best alignment-utility tradeoff among all baselines: reducing sycophancy to near-SFT levels while improving helpfulness, decreasing verbosity while achieving the highest ROUGE-L, and suppressing code gaming while improving Pass@1. Beyond single-domain evaluation, we show that reward hacking, detection, and mitigation all generalize across domains -- a Hacker trained on code gaming exhibits increased sycophancy despite no reward for this behavior, and an Auditor trained on one domain effectively suppresses exploitation in others, enabling efficient multi-domain defense with a single model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01750v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MGKAN: Predicting Asymmetric Drug-Drug Interactions via a Multimodal Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01751</link><description>arXiv:2602.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is essential for safe pharmacological treatments. Previous graph neural network (GNN) models leverage molecular structures and interaction networks but mostly rely on linear aggregation and symmetric assumptions, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear and heterogeneous patterns. We propose MGKAN, a Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network that introduces learnable basis functions into asymmetric DDI prediction. MGKAN replaces conventional MLP transformations with KAN-driven basis functions, enabling more expressive and nonlinear modeling of drug relationships. To capture pharmacological dependencies, MGKAN integrates three network views-an asymmetric DDI network, a co-interaction network, and a biochemical similarity network-with role-specific embeddings to preserve directional semantics. A fusion module combines linear attention and nonlinear transformation to enhance representational capacity. On two benchmark datasets, MGKAN outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies and case studies confirm its predictive accuracy and effectiveness in modeling directional drug effects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01751v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WorldCup Sampling for Multi-bit LLM Watermarking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01752</link><description>arXiv:2602.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) generate increasingly human-like text, watermarking offers a promising solution for reliable attribution beyond mere detection. While multi-bit watermarking enables richer provenance encoding, existing methods largely extend zero-bit schemes through seed-driven steering, leading to indirect information flow, limited effective capacity, and suboptimal decoding. In this paper, we propose WorldCup, a multi-bit watermarking framework for LLMs that treats sampling as a natural communication channel and embeds message bits directly into token selection via a hierarchical competition mechanism guided by complementary signals. Moreover, WorldCup further adopts entropy-aware modulation to preserve generation quality and supports robust message recovery through confidence-aware decoding. Comprehensive experiments show that WorldCup achieves a strong balance across capacity, detectability, robustness, text quality, and decoding efficiency, consistently outperforming prior baselines and laying a solid foundation for future LLM watermarking studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01752v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ObjEmbed: Towards Universal Multimodal Object Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01753</link><description>arXiv:2602.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning objects with corresponding textual descriptions is a fundamental challenge and a realistic requirement in vision-language understanding. While recent multimodal embedding models excel at global image-text alignment, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment between image regions and specific phrases. In this work, we present ObjEmbed, a novel MLLM embedding model that decomposes the input image into multiple regional embeddings, each corresponding to an individual object, along with global embeddings. It supports a wide range of visual understanding tasks like visual grounding, local image retrieval, and global image retrieval. ObjEmbed enjoys three key properties: (1) Object-Oriented Representation: It captures both semantic and spatial aspects of objects by generating two complementary embeddings for each region: an object embedding for semantic matching and an IoU embedding that predicts localization quality.

Abstract: Smart parking systems help reduce congestion and minimize users' search time, thereby contributing to smart city adoption and enhancing urban mobility. In previous works, we presented a system developed on a university campus to monitor parking availability by estimating the number of free spaces from vehicle counts within a region of interest. Although this approach achieved good accuracy, it restricted the system's ability to provide spot-level insights and support more advanced applications. To overcome this limitation, we extend the system with a spot-wise monitoring strategy based on a distance-aware matching method with spatial tolerance, enhanced through an Adaptive Bounding Box Partitioning method for challenging spaces. The proposed approach achieves a balanced accuracy of 98.80% while maintaining an inference time of 8 seconds on a resource-constrained edge device, enhancing the capabilities of YOLOv11m, a model that has a size of 40.5 MB. In addition, two new components were introduced: (i) a Digital Shadow that visually represents parking lot entities as a base to evolve to a full Digital Twin, and (ii) an application support server based on a repurposed TV box. The latter not only enables scalable communication among cloud services, the parking totem, and a bot that provides detailed spot occupancy statistics, but also promotes hardware reuse as a step towards greater sustainability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01754v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing high-bandwidth graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01755</link><description>arXiv:2602.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unweighted, undirected graph $G$ on $n$ nodes is said to have \emph{bandwidth} at most $k$ if its nodes can be labelled from $0$ to $n - 1$ such that no two adjacent nodes have labels that differ by more than $k$. It is known that one can decide whether the bandwidth of $G$ is at most $k$ in $O(n^k)$ time and $O(n^k)$ space using dynamic programming techniques. For small $k$ close to $0$, this approach is effectively polynomial, but as $k$ scales with $n$, it becomes superexponential, requiring up to $O(n^{n - 1})$ time (where $n - 1$ is the maximum possible bandwidth). In this paper, we reformulate the problem in terms of bipartite matching for sufficiently large $k \ge \lfloor (n - 1)/2 \rfloor$, allowing us to use Hall's marriage theorem to develop an algorithm that runs in $O(n^{n - k + 1})$ time and $O(n)$ auxiliary space (beyond storage of the input graph). This yields polynomial complexity for large $k$ close to $n - 1$, demonstrating that the bandwidth recognition problem is solvable in polynomial time whenever either $k$ or $n - k$ remains small.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01755v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mind-Brush: Integrating Agentic Cognitive Search and Reasoning into Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01756</link><description>arXiv:2602.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While text-to-image generation has achieved unprecedented fidelity, the vast majority of existing models function fundamentally as static text-to-pixel decoders. Consequently, they often fail to grasp implicit user intentions. Although emerging unified understanding-generation models have improved intent comprehension, they still struggle to accomplish tasks involving complex knowledge reasoning within a single model. Moreover, constrained by static internal priors, these models remain unable to adapt to the evolving dynamics of the real world. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Mind-Brush, a unified agentic framework that transforms generation into a dynamic, knowledge-driven workflow. Simulating a human-like 'think-research-create' paradigm, Mind-Brush actively retrieves multimodal evidence to ground out-of-distribution concepts and employs reasoning tools to resolve implicit visual constraints. To rigorously evaluate these capabilities, we propose Mind-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 500 distinct samples spanning real-time news, emerging concepts, and domains such as mathematical and Geo-Reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mind-Brush significantly enhances the capabilities of unified models, realizing a zero-to-one capability leap for the Qwen-Image baseline on Mind-Bench, while achieving superior results on established benchmarks like WISE and RISE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01756v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero2Text: Zero-Training Cross-Domain Inversion Attacks on Textual Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01757</link><description>arXiv:2602.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has established vector databases as critical infrastructure, yet they introduce severe privacy risks via embedding inversion attacks. Existing paradigms face a fundamental trade-off: optimization-based methods require computationally prohibitive queries, while alignment-based approaches hinge on the unrealistic assumption of accessible in-domain training data. These constraints render them ineffective in strict black-box and cross-domain settings. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce Zero2Text, a novel training-free framework based on recursive online alignment. Unlike methods relying on static datasets, Zero2Text synergizes LLM priors with a dynamic ridge regression mechanism to iteratively align generation to the target embedding on-the-fly. We further demonstrate that standard defenses, such as differential privacy, fail to effectively mitigate this adaptive threat. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate Zero2Text; notably, on MS MARCO against the OpenAI victim model, it achieves 1.8x higher ROUGE-L and 6.4x higher BLEU-2 scores compared to baselines, recovering sentences from unknown domains without a single leaked data pair.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01757v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MagicFuse: Single Image Fusion for Visual and Semantic Reinforcement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01760</link><description>arXiv:2602.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a highly practical scenario: how to continue benefiting from the advantages of multi-modal image fusion under harsh conditions when only visible imaging sensors are available. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel concept of single-image fusion, which extends conventional data-level fusion to the knowledge level. Specifically, we develop MagicFuse, a novel single image fusion framework capable of deriving a comprehensive cross-spectral scene representation from a single low-quality visible image. MagicFuse first introduces an intra-spectral knowledge reinforcement branch and a cross-spectral knowledge generation branch based on the diffusion models. They mine scene information obscured in the visible spectrum and learn thermal radiation distribution patterns transferred to the infrared spectrum, respectively. Building on them, we design a multi-domain knowledge fusion branch that integrates the probabilistic noise from the diffusion streams of these two branches, from which a cross-spectral scene representation can be obtained through successive sampling. Then, we impose both visual and semantic constraints to ensure that this scene representation can satisfy human observation while supporting downstream semantic decision-making. Extensive experiments show that our MagicFuse achieves visual and semantic representation performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art fusion methods with multi-modal inputs, despite relying solely on a single degraded visible image.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01760v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PRISM: Parametrically Refactoring Inference for Speculative Sampling Draft Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01762</link><description>arXiv:2602.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), constrained by their auto-regressive nature, suffer from slow decoding. Speculative decoding methods have emerged as a promising solution to accelerate LLM decoding, attracting attention from both systems and AI research communities. Recently, the pursuit of better draft quality has driven a trend toward parametrically larger draft models, which inevitably introduces substantial computational overhead. While existing work attempts to balance the trade-off between prediction accuracy and compute latency, we address this fundamental dilemma through architectural innovation.
  We propose PRISM, which disaggregates the computation of each predictive step across different parameter sets, refactoring the computational pathways of draft models to successfully decouple model capacity from inference cost. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PRISM outperforms all existing draft architectures, achieving exceptional acceptance lengths while maintaining minimal draft latency for superior end-to-end speedup. We also re-examine scaling laws with PRISM, revealing that PRISM scales more effectively with expanding data volumes than other draft architectures. Through rigorous and fair comparison, we show that PRISM boosts the decoding throughput of an already highly optimized inference engine by more than 2.6x.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01762v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Provable Expressiveness Hierarchy in Hybrid Linear-Full Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01763</link><description>arXiv:2602.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers serve as the foundation of most modern large language models. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of standard full attention, various efficient attention mechanisms, such as linear and hybrid attention, have been developed. A fundamental gap remains: their expressive power relative to full attention lacks a rigorous theoretical characterization. In this work, we theoretically characterize the performance differences among these attention mechanisms. Our theory applies to all linear attention variants that can be formulated as a recurrence, including Mamba, DeltaNet, etc. Specifically, we establish an expressiveness hierarchy: for the sequential function composition-a multi-step reasoning task that must occur within a model's forward pass, an ($L+1$)-layer full attention network is sufficient, whereas any hybrid network interleaving $L-1$ layers of full attention with a substantially larger number ($2^{3L^2}$) of linear attention layers cannot solve it. This result demonstrates a clear separation in expressive power between the two types of attention. Our work provides the first provable separation between hybrid attention and standard full attention, offering a theoretical perspective for understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations of different attention mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01763v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GDPR-Compliant Person Recognition in Industrial Environments Using MEMS-LiDAR and Hybrid Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01764</link><description>arXiv:2602.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable detection of unauthorized individuals in safety-critical industrial indoor spaces is crucial to avoid plant shutdowns, property damage, and personal hazards. Conventional vision-based methods that use deep-learning approaches for person recognition provide image information but are sensitive to lighting and visibility conditions and often violate privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. Typically, detection systems based on deep learning require annotated data for training. Collecting and annotating such data, however, is highly time-consuming and due to manual treatments not necessarily error free. Therefore, this paper presents a privacy-compliant approach based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems LiDAR (MEMS-LiDAR), which exclusively captures anonymized 3D point clouds and avoids personal identification features. To compensate for the large amount of time required to record real LiDAR data and for post-processing and annotation, real recordings are augmented with synthetically generated scenes from the CARLA simulation framework. The results demonstrate that the hybrid data improves the average precision by 44 percentage points compared to a model trained exclusively with real data while reducing the manual annotation effort by 50 %. Thus, the proposed approach provides a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to purely real-data-based methods and systematically shows how synthetic LiDAR data can combine high performance in person detection with GDPR compliance in an industrial environment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01764v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Backdoor Sentinel: Detecting and Detoxifying Backdoors in Diffusion Models via Temporal Noise Consistency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01765</link><description>arXiv:2602.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely deployed in AIGC services; however, their reliance on opaque training data and procedures exposes a broad attack surface for backdoor injection. In practical auditing scenarios, due to the protection of intellectual property and commercial confidentiality, auditors are typically unable to access model parameters, rendering existing white-box or query-intensive detection methods impractical. More importantly, even after the backdoor is detected, existing detoxification approaches are often trapped in a dilemma between detoxification effectiveness and generation quality.
  In this work, we identify a previously unreported phenomenon called temporal noise unconsistency, where the noise predictions between adjacent diffusion timesteps is disrupted in specific temporal segments when the input is triggered, while remaining stable under clean inputs. Leveraging this finding, we propose Temporal Noise Consistency Defense (TNC-Defense), a unified framework for backdoor detection and detoxification. The framework first uses the adjacent timestep noise consistency to design a gray-box detection module, for identifying and locating anomalous diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, the framework uses the identified anomalous timesteps to construct a trigger-agnostic, timestep-aware detoxification module, which directly corrects the backdoor generation path. This effectively suppresses backdoor behavior while significantly reducing detoxification costs.
  We evaluate the proposed method under five representative backdoor attack scenarios and compare it with state-of-the-art defenses. The results show that TNC-Defense improves the average detection accuracy by $11\%$ with negligible additional overhead, and invalidates an average of $98.5\%$ of triggered samples with only a mild degradation in generation quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01765v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoMeT: Collaborative Memory Transformer for Efficient Long Context Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01766</link><description>arXiv:2602.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity and indefinitely growing key-value (KV) cache of standard Transformers pose a major barrier to long-context processing. To overcome this, we introduce the Collaborative Memory Transformer (CoMeT), a novel architecture that enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long sequences with constant memory usage and linear time complexity. Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence. On the SCROLLS benchmark, CoMeT surpasses other efficient methods and achieves performance comparable to a full-attention baseline on summarization tasks. Its practical effectiveness is further validated on real-world agent and user behavior QA tasks.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a fundamental challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a key alignment framework, existing approaches often rely heavily on costly external evaluators for scoring or rewriting, incurring off-policy learnability gaps and discretization loss. Due to the lack of access to internal states, such feedback overlooks the fine-grained conflicts between different modalities that lead to hallucinations during generation.
  To address this issue, we propose IRIS (Implicit Reward-Guided Internal Sifting), which leverages continuous implicit rewards in the native log-probability space to preserve full information density and capture internal modal competition. This on-policy paradigm eliminates learnability gaps by utilizing self-generated preference pairs. By sifting these pairs based on multimodal implicit rewards, IRIS ensures that optimization is driven by signals that directly resolve modal conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IRIS achieves highly competitive performance on key hallucination benchmarks using only 5.7k samples, without requiring any external feedback during preference alignment. These results confirm that IRIS provides an efficient and principled paradigm for mitigating MLLM hallucinations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01769v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] &lt;SOG_k&gt;: One LLM Token for Explicit Graph Structural Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01771</link><description>arXiv:2602.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models show great potential in unstructured data understanding, but still face significant challenges with graphs due to their structural hallucination. Existing approaches mainly either verbalize graphs into natural language, which leads to excessive token consumption and scattered attention, or transform graphs into trainable continuous embeddings (i.e., soft prompt), but exhibit severe misalignment with original text tokens. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate one special token  to fully represent the Structure Of Graph within a unified token space, facilitating explicit topology input and structural information sharing. Specifically, we propose a topology-aware structural tokenizer that maps each graph topology into a highly selective single token. Afterwards, we construct a set of hybrid structure Question-Answering corpora to align new structural tokens with existing text tokens. With this approach,  empowers LLMs to understand, generate, and reason in a concise and accurate manner. Extensive experiments on five graph-level benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving a performance improvement of 9.9% to 41.4% compared to the baselines while exhibiting interpretability and consistency. Furthermore, our method provides a flexible extension to node-level tasks, enabling both global and local structural understanding.

Abstract: Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) has established itself as a cornerstone of proteomic profiling and large-scale systems biology, offering unparalleled depth and reproducibility. Current DIA analysis frameworks, however, require semi-supervised training within each run for peptide-spectrum match (PSM) re-scoring. This approach is prone to overfitting and lacks generalizability across diverse species and experimental conditions. Here, we present DIA-CLIP, a pre-trained model shifting the DIA analysis paradigm from semi-supervised training to universal cross-modal representation learning. By integrating dual-encoder contrastive learning framework with encoder-decoder architecture, DIA-CLIP establishes a unified cross-modal representation for peptides and corresponding spectral features, achieving high-precision, zero-shot PSM inference. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DIA-CLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tools, yielding up to a 45% increase in protein identification while achieving a 12% reduction in entrapment identifications. Moreover, DIA-CLIP holds immense potential for diverse practical applications, such as single-cell and spatial proteomics, where its enhanced identification depth facilitates the discovery of novel biomarkers and the elucidates of intricate cellular mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cost-Aware Bayesian Optimization for Prototyping Interactive Devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01774</link><description>arXiv:2602.01774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciding which idea is worth prototyping is a central concern in iterative design. A prototype should be produced when the expected improvement is high and the cost is low. However, this is hard to decide, because costs can vary drastically: a simple parameter tweak may take seconds, while fabricating hardware consumes material and energy. Such asymmetries, can discourage a designer from exploring the design space. In this paper, we present an extension of cost-aware Bayesian optimization to account for diverse prototyping costs. The method builds on the power of Bayesian optimization and requires only a minimal modification to the acquisition function. The key idea is to use designer-estimated costs to guide sampling toward more cost-effective prototypes. In technical evaluations, the method achieved comparable utility to a cost-agnostic baseline while requiring only ${\approx}70\%$ of the cost; under strict budgets, it outperformed the baseline threefold. A within-subjects study with 12 participants in a realistic joystick design task demonstrated similar benefits. These results show that accounting for prototyping costs can make Bayesian optimization more compatible with real-world design projects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01774v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Cross-Architecture Knowledge Transfer for Large-Scale Online User Response Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01775</link><description>arXiv:2602.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying new architectures in large-scale user response prediction systems incurs high model switching costs due to expensive retraining on massive historical data and performance degradation under data retention constraints. Existing knowledge distillation methods struggle with architectural heterogeneity and the prohibitive cost of transferring large embedding tables. We propose CrossAdapt, a two-stage framework for efficient cross-architecture knowledge transfer. The offline stage enables rapid embedding transfer via dimension-adaptive projections without iterative training, combined with progressive network distillation and strategic sampling to reduce computational cost. The online stage introduces asymmetric co-distillation, where students update frequently while teachers update infrequently, together with a distribution-aware adaptation mechanism that dynamically balances historical knowledge preservation and fast adaptation to evolving data. Experiments on three public datasets show that CrossAdapt achieves 0.27-0.43% AUC improvements while reducing training time by 43-71%. Large-scale deployment on Tencent WeChat Channels (~10M daily samples) further demonstrates its effectiveness, significantly mitigating AUC degradation, LogLoss increase, and prediction bias compared to standard distillation baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01775v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: Beyond Model-Centric Prediction -- Agentic Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01776</link><description>arXiv:2602.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting has traditionally been formulated as a model-centric, static, and single-pass prediction problem that maps historical observations to future values. While this paradigm has driven substantial progress, it proves insufficient in adaptive and multi-turn settings where forecasting requires informative feature extraction, reasoning-driven inference, iterative refinement, and continual adaptation over time. In this paper, we argue for agentic time series forecasting (ATSF), which reframes forecasting as an agentic process composed of perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory. Rather than focusing solely on predictive models, ATSF emphasizes organizing forecasting as an agentic workflow that can interact with tools, incorporate feedback from outcomes, and evolve through experience accumulation. We outline three representative implementation paradigms -- workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid agentic workflow paradigm -- and discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting from model-centric prediction to agentic forecasting. Together, this position aims to establish agentic forecasting as a foundation for future research at the intersection of time series forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01776v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stein-Rule Shrinkage for Stochastic Gradient Estimation in High Dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01777</link><description>arXiv:2602.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient methods are central to large-scale learning, yet their analysis typically treats mini-batch gradients as unbiased estimators of the population gradient. In high-dimensional settings, however, classical results from statistical decision theory show that unbiased estimators are generally inadmissible under quadratic loss, suggesting that standard stochastic gradients may be suboptimal from a risk perspective. In this work, we formulate stochastic gradient computation as a high-dimensional estimation problem and introduce a decision-theoretic framework based on Stein-rule shrinkage. We construct a shrinkage gradient estimator that adaptively contracts noisy mini-batch gradients toward a stable restricted estimator derived from historical momentum. The shrinkage intensity is determined in a data-driven manner using an online estimate of gradient noise variance, leveraging second-moment statistics commonly maintained by adaptive optimization methods. Under a Gaussian noise model and for dimension p&gt;=3, we show that the proposed estimator uniformly dominates the standard stochastic gradient under squared error loss and is minimax-optimal in the classical decision-theoretic sense. We further demonstrate how this estimator can be incorporated into the Adam optimizer, yielding a practical algorithm with negligible additional computational cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, across multiple levels of label noise, show consistent improvements over Adam in the large-batch regime. Ablation studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from selectively applying shrinkage to high-dimensional convolutional layers, while indiscriminate shrinkage across all parameters degrades performance. These results illustrate that classical shrinkage principles provide a principled and effective approach to improving stochastic gradient estimation in modern deep learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data Distribution Matters: A Data-Centric Perspective on Context Compression for Large Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01778</link><description>arXiv:2602.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context scenarios is hindered by computational inefficiency and significant information redundancy. Although recent advancements have widely adopted context compression to address these challenges, existing research only focus on model-side improvements, the impact of the data distribution itself on context compression remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to adopt a data-centric perspective to systematically investigate how data distribution impacts compression quality, including two dimensions: input data and intrinsic data (i.e., the model's internal pretrained knowledge). We evaluate the semantic integrity of compressed representations using an autoencoder-based framework to systematically investigate it. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) encoder-measured input entropy negatively correlates with compression quality, while decoder-measured entropy shows no significant relationship under a frozen-decoder setting; and (2) the gap between intrinsic data of the encoder and decoder significantly diminishes compression gains, which is hard to mitigate. Based on these findings, we further present practical guidelines to optimize compression gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01778v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LingLanMiDian: Systematic Evaluation of LLMs on TCM Knowledge and Clinical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01779</link><description>arXiv:2602.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly in medical NLP, yet Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with its distinctive ontology, terminology, and reasoning patterns requires domain-faithful evaluation. Existing TCM benchmarks are fragmented in coverage and scale and rely on non-unified or generation-heavy scoring that hinders fair comparison. We present the LingLanMiDian (LingLan) benchmark, a large-scale, expert-curated, multi-task suite that unifies evaluation across knowledge recall, multi-hop reasoning, information extraction, and real-world clinical decision-making. LingLan introduces a consistent metric design, a synonym-tolerant protocol for clinical labels, a per-dataset 400-item Hard subset, and a reframing of diagnosis and treatment recommendation into single-choice decision recognition. We conduct comprehensive, zero-shot evaluations on 14 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs, providing a unified perspective on their strengths and limitations in TCM commonsense knowledge understanding, reasoning, and clinical decision support; critically, the evaluation on Hard subset reveals a substantial gap between current models and human experts in TCM-specialized reasoning. By bridging fundamental knowledge and applied reasoning through standardized evaluation, LingLan establishes a unified, quantitative, and extensible foundation for advancing TCM LLMs and domain-specific medical AI research.

To address this efficiency-performance bottleneck, we introduce DDP-WM, a novel world model centered on the principle of Disentangled Dynamics Prediction (DDP). We hypothesize that latent state evolution in observed scenes is heterogeneous and can be decomposed into sparse primary dynamics driven by physical interactions and secondary context-driven background updates. DDP-WM realizes this decomposition through an architecture that integrates efficient historical processing with dynamic localization to isolate primary dynamics. By employing a crossattention mechanism for background updates, the framework optimizes resource allocation and provides a smooth optimization landscape for planners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDP-WM achieves significant efficiency and performance across diverse tasks, including navigation, precise tabletop manipulation, and complex deformable or multi-body interactions. Specifically, on the challenging Push-T task, DDP-WM achieves an approximately 9 times inference speedup and improves the MPC success rate from 90% to98% compared to state-of-the-art dense models. The results establish a promising path for developing efficient, high-fidelity world models.

Abstract: Characterisation of structural discontinuity sets in exposed rock faces of underground mine cavities is essential for assessing rock-mass stability, excavation safety, and operational efficiency. UAV and other mobile laser-scanning techniques provide efficient means of collecting point clouds from rock faces. However, the development of a robust and efficient approach for automatic characterisation of discontinuity sets in real-world scenarios, like fully enclosed rock faces in cavities, remains an open research problem. In this study, a new approach is proposed for automatic discontinuity set characterisation that uses a single-shot filtering strategy, an innovative cyclic orientation transformation scheme and a hierarchical clustering technique. The single-shot filtering step isolates planar regions while robustly suppressing noise and high-curvature artefacts in one pass using a signal-processing technique. To address the limitations of Cartesian clustering on polar orientation data, a cyclic orientation transformation scheme is developed, enabling accurate representation of dip angle and dip direction in Cartesian space. The transformed orientations are then characterised into sets using a hierarchical clustering technique, which handles varying density distributions and identifies clusters without requiring user-defined set numbers. The accuracy of the method is validated on real-world mine stope and against ground truth obtained using manually handpicked discontinuity planes identified with the Virtual Compass tool, as well as widely used automated structure mapping techniques. The proposed approach outperforms the other techniques by exhibiting the lowest mean absolute error in estimating discontinuity set orientations in real-world stope data with errors of 1.95{\deg} and 2.20{\deg} in nominal dip angle and dip direction, respectively, and dispersion errors lying below 3{\deg}.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01783v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CodeOCR: On the Effectiveness of Vision Language Models in Code Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01785</link><description>arXiv:2602.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in source code understanding, yet as software systems grow in scale, computational efficiency has become a critical bottleneck. Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RFS: Reinforcement learning with Residual flow steering for dexterous manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01789</link><description>arXiv:2602.01789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as an effective approach for bootstrapping sequential decision-making in robotics, achieving strong performance even in high-dimensional dexterous manipulation tasks. Recent behavior cloning methods further leverage expressive generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching, to represent multimodal action distributions. However, policies pretrained in this manner often exhibit limited generalization and require additional fine-tuning to achieve robust performance at deployment time. Such adaptation must preserve the global exploration benefits of pretraining while enabling rapid correction of local execution errors.We propose \emph{Residual Flow Steering} (RFS), a data-efficient reinforcement learning framework for adapting pretrained generative policies. RFS steers a pretrained flow-matching policy by jointly optimizing a residual action and a latent noise distribution, enabling complementary forms of exploration: local refinement through residual corrections and global exploration through latent-space modulation. This design allows efficient adaptation while retaining the expressive structure of the pretrained policy.We demonstrate the effectiveness of RFS on dexterous manipulation tasks, showing efficient fine-tuning both in simulation and in real-world settings when adapting pretrained base policies.Project website:https://weirdlabuw.github.io/rfs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01789v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grad2Reward: From Sparse Judgment to Dense Rewards for Improving Open-Ended LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01791</link><description>arXiv:2602.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in complex LLM reasoning within verifiable domains, such as mathematics and programming. Recent efforts have sought to extend this paradigm to open-ended tasks by employing LLMs-as-a-Judge to provide sequence-level rewards for policy optimization. However, these rewards are inherently sparse, failing to provide the fine-grained supervision necessary for generating complex, long-form trajectories. Furthermore, current work treats the Judge as a black-box oracle, discarding the rich intermediate feedback signals encoded in it. To address these limitations, we introduce Grad2Reward, a novel framework that extracts dense process rewards directly from the Judge's model inference process via a single backward pass. By leveraging gradient-based attribution, Grad2Reward enables precise token-level credit assignment, substantially enhancing training efficiency and reasoning quality. Additionally, Grad2Reward introduces a self-judging mechanism, allowing the policy to improve through its own evaluative signals without training specialized reward models or reliance on superior external Judges. The experiments demonstrate that policies optimized with Grad2Reward achieve outstanding performance across diverse open-ended tasks, affirming its effectiveness and broad generalizability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ParaGSE: Parallel Generative Speech Enhancement with Group-Vector-Quantization-based Neural Speech Codec</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01793</link><description>arXiv:2602.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, generative speech enhancement has garnered considerable interest; however, existing approaches are hindered by excessive complexity, limited efficiency, and suboptimal speech quality. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel parallel generative speech enhancement (ParaGSE) framework that leverages a group vector quantization (GVQ)-based neural speech codec. The GVQ-based codec adopts separate VQs to produce mutually independent tokens, enabling efficient parallel token prediction in ParaGSE. Specifically, ParaGSE leverages the GVQ-based codec to encode degraded speech into distinct tokens, predicts the corresponding clean tokens through parallel branches conditioned on degraded spectral features, and ultimately reconstructs clean speech via the codec decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that ParaGSE consistently produces superior enhanced speech compared to both discriminative and generative baselines, under a wide range of distortions including noise, reverberation, band-limiting, and their mixtures. Furthermore, empowered by parallel computation in token prediction, ParaGSE attains about a 1.5-fold improvement in generation efficiency on CPU compared with serial generative speech enhancement approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01793v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RedVisor: Reasoning-Aware Prompt Injection Defense via Zero-Copy KV Cache Reuse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01795</link><description>arXiv:2602.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to Prompt Injection (PI) attacks, where adversarial instructions hidden within retrieved contexts hijack the model's execution flow. Current defenses typically face a critical trade-off: prevention-based fine-tuning often degrades general utility via the "alignment tax", while detection-based filtering incurs prohibitive latency and memory costs. To bridge this gap, we propose RedVisor, a unified framework that synthesizes the explainability of detection systems with the seamless integration of prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, RedVisor is the first approach to leverage fine-grained reasoning paths to simultaneously detect attacks and guide the model's safe response. We implement this via a lightweight, removable adapter positioned atop the frozen backbone. This adapter serves a dual function: it first generates an explainable analysis that precisely localizes the injection and articulates the threat, which then explicitly conditions the model to reject the malicious command. Uniquely, the adapter is active only during this reasoning phase and is effectively muted during the subsequent response generation. This architecture yields two distinct advantages: (1) it mathematically preserves the backbone's original utility on benign inputs; and (2) it enables a novel KV Cache Reuse strategy, eliminating the redundant prefill computation inherent to decoupled pipelines. We further pioneer the integration of this defense into the vLLM serving engine with custom kernels. Experiments demonstrate that RedVisor outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in detection accuracy and throughput while incurring negligible utility loss.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01795v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CritiqueCrew: Orchestrating Multi-Perspective Conversational Design Critique</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01796</link><description>arXiv:2602.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UI designers face growing cognitive load and cross functional friction at the intersection of user needs, business goals, and engineering constraints. Existing automated tools often deliver static "problem lists", lacking actionable repair paths and disrupting creative flow. We introduce CritiqueCrew, a Figma tool that supports designers through conversational critique. CritiqueCrew generates multi-faceted insights by implementing a multi-perspective orchestration of distinct expert roles (UX, PM, Engineer). It translates abstract critiques into concrete actions via in context feedback and interactive remediation. Across two independent controlled studies (Total N=48), CritiqueCrew significantly improved both design quality and subjective experience compared to a traditional static checker. Furthermore, our results confirm that the structured orchestration of expert roles-rather than a unified model-is key to fostering trust and creativity support. Our work demonstrates how AI can shift from a "problem auditor" to a "solution co-creator" by integrating multi-perspective dialogue with interactive repair, offering design implications for future creative tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ORCH: many analyses, one merge-a deterministic multi-agent orchestrator for discrete-choice reasoning with EMA-guided routing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01797</link><description>arXiv:2602.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale language models (LLMs) have made multi-agent architectures attractive for challenging reasoning tasks. However, many existing systems rely on stochastic routing or ad-hoc heuristics, making their behavior difficult to reproduce and their decision process hard to interpret. We propose ORCH, a deterministic coordination framework for discrete-choice reasoning that orchestrates heterogeneous LLMs. ORCH follows a ``many analyses, one decision'' paradigm: multiple base models independently produce structured analyses, and a dedicated merge agent outputs the final choice. The framework uses fixed rules for task decomposition and answer aggregation, keeping the pipeline predictable, reproducible, and training-free. Determinism here refers to fixed routing and aggregation rules under a fixed evaluation protocol, rather than strict bit-level reproducibility across deployments. To exploit model complementarity, we optionally introduce an EMA-guided router that updates agent selection using historical accuracy, latency, or cost; since it relies on answer-based feedback, it is mainly intended for benchmarking, controlled evaluation, or delayed-feedback settings. Experiments on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GSM8K show that ORCH consistently outperforms single-model baselines and a majority-vote ensemble. On MMLU-Pro, ORCH improves accuracy by over 10 points compared to the strongest baseline, and on GSM8K it yields gains exceeding 50 points; McNemar tests confirm statistical significance. The EMA router provides an additional 0.7--2.0 point accuracy boost, and ablations show that both multi-agent collaboration and routing contribute substantially. Overall, ORCH offers a practical path toward controllable, interpretable, and deployment-ready LLM-based agent systems for discrete-choice reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01797v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spatio-Temporal Transformers for Long-Term NDVI Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01799</link><description>arXiv:2602.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term satellite image time series (SITS) analysis in heterogeneous landscapes faces significant challenges, particularly in Mediterranean regions where complex spatial patterns, seasonal variations, and multi-decade environmental changes interact across different scales. This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers. The framework's ability to handle irregular temporal sampling and variable prediction horizons makes it particularly suitable for analysis of heterogeneous landscapes experiencing rapid ecological transitions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01799v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast Autoregressive Video Diffusion and World Models with Temporal Cache Compression and Sparse Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01801</link><description>arXiv:2602.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models enable streaming generation, opening the door to long-form synthesis, video world models, and interactive neural game engines. However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fostering Data Collaboration in Digital Transportation Marketplaces: The Role of Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01804</link><description>arXiv:2602.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data collaboration between municipal authorities (MA) and mobility providers (MPs) has brought tremendous benefits to transportation systems in the era of big data. Engaging in collaboration can improve the service operations (e.g., reduced delay) of these data owners, however, it can also raise privacy concerns and discourage data-sharing willingness. Specifically, data owners may be concerned that the shared data may leak sensitive information about their customers' mobility patterns or business secrets, resulting in the failure of collaboration. This paper investigates how privacy-preserving mechanisms can foster data collaboration in such settings. We propose a game-theoretic framework to investigate data-sharing among transportation stakeholders, especially considering perturbation-based privacy-preserving mechanisms. Numerical studies demonstrate that lower data quality expectations can incentivize voluntary data sharing, improving transport-related welfare for both MAs and MPs. Our findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and system designers on how privacy-preserving technologies can help bridge data silos and promote collaborative, privacy-aware transportation systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlowBypass: Rectified Flow Trajectory Bypass for Training-Free Image Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01805</link><description>arXiv:2602.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training-free image editing has attracted increasing attention for its efficiency and independence from training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on inversion-reconstruction trajectories, which impose an inherent trade-off: longer trajectories accumulate errors and compromise fidelity, while shorter ones fail to ensure sufficient alignment with the edit prompt. Previous attempts to address this issue typically employ backbone-specific feature manipulations, limiting general applicability. To address these challenges, we propose FlowBypass, a novel and analytical framework grounded in Rectified Flow that constructs a bypass directly connecting inversion and reconstruction trajectories, thereby mitigating error accumulation without relying on feature manipulations. We provide a formal derivation of two trajectories, from which we obtain an approximate bypass formulation and its numerical solution, enabling seamless trajectory transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowBypass consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods, achieving stronger prompt alignment while preserving high-fidelity details in irrelevant regions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01805v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sentence Curve Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01807</link><description>arXiv:2602.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are a central component of modern AI systems, and diffusion-based language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive alternative. Both paradigms rely on word embeddings not only to represent the input sentence, but also to represent the target sentence that backbone models are trained to predict. We argue that such static embedding of the target word is insensitive to neighboring words, encouraging locally accurate word prediction while neglecting global structure across the target sentence. To address this limitation, we propose a continuous sentence representation, termed sentence curve, defined as a spline curve whose control points affect multiple words in the sentence. Based on this representation, we introduce sentence curve language model (SCLM), which extends DLMs to predict sentence curves instead of the static word embeddings. We theoretically show that sentence curve prediction induces a regularization effect that promotes global structure modeling, and characterize how different sentence curve types affect this behavior. Empirically, SCLM achieves SOTA performance among DLMs on IWSLT14 and WMT14, shows stable training without burdensome knowledge distillation, and demonstrates promising potential compared to discrete DLMs on LM1B.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01807v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Knowing to Doing Precisely: A General Self-Correction and Termination Framework for VLA models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01811</link><description>arXiv:2602.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While vision-language-action (VLA) models for embodied agents integrate perception, reasoning, and control, they remain constrained by two critical weaknesses: first, during grasping tasks, the action tokens generated by the language model often exhibit subtle spatial deviations from the target object, resulting in grasp failures; second, they lack the ability to reliably recognize task completion, which leads to redundant actions and frequent timeout errors. To address these challenges and enhance robustness, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework, VLA-SCT. This framework operates as a self-correcting control loop, combining data-driven action refinement with conditional logic for termination. Consequently, compared to baseline approaches, our method achieves consistent improvements across all datasets in the LIBERO benchmark, significantly increasing the success rate of fine manipulation tasks and ensuring accurate task completion, thereby promoting the deployment of more reliable VLA agents in complex, unstructured environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01811v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LDRNet: Large Deformation Registration Model for Chest CT Registration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01812</link><description>arXiv:2602.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the deep learning based medical image registration algorithms focus on brain image registration tasks.Compared with brain registration, the chest CT registration has larger deformation, more complex background and region over-lap. In this paper, we propose a fast unsupervised deep learning method, LDRNet, for large deformation image registration of chest CT images. We first predict a coarse resolution registration field, then refine it from coarse to fine. We propose two innovative technical components: 1) a refine block that is used to refine the registration field in different resolutions, 2) a rigid block that is used to learn transformation matrix from high-level features. We train and evaluate our model on the private dataset and public dataset SegTHOR. We compare our performance with state-of-the-art traditional registration methods as well as deep learning registration models VoxelMorph, RCN, and LapIRN.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in video generation; however, the high computational cost of the denoising process remains a major bottleneck. Existing approaches have shown promise in reducing the number of diffusion steps, but they often suffer from significant quality degradation when applied to video generation. We propose Guided Progressive Distillation (GPD), a framework that accelerates the diffusion process for fast and high-quality video generation. GPD introduces a novel training strategy in which a teacher model progressively guides a student model to operate with larger step sizes. The framework consists of two key components: (1) an online-generated training target that reduces optimization difficulty while improving computational efficiency, and (2) frequency-domain constraints in the latent space that promote the preservation of fine-grained details and temporal dynamics. Applied to the Wan2.1 model, GPD reduces the number of sampling steps from 48 to 6 while maintaining competitive visual quality on VBench. Compared with existing distillation methods, GPD demonstrates clear advantages in both pipeline simplicity and quality preservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01814v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] INDIBATOR: Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01815</link><description>arXiv:2602.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating scientific discovery. To differentiate agent behavior in the multi-agent system, current frameworks typically assign generic role-based personas such as ''reviewer'' or ''writer'' or rely on coarse grained keyword-based personas. While functional, this approach oversimplifies how human scientists operate, whose contributions are shaped by their unique research trajectories. In response, we propose INDIBATOR, a framework for molecular discovery that grounds agents in individualized scientist profiles constructed from two modalities: publication history for literature-derived knowledge and molecular history for structural priors. These agents engage in multi-turn debate through proposal, critique, and voting phases. Our evaluation demonstrates that these fine-grained individuality-grounded agents consistently outperform systems relying on coarse-grained personas, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These results validate that capturing the ``scientific DNA'' of individual agents is essential for high-quality discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01815v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Seeing Is Believing?

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency on general-purpose vision-language benchmarks, reaching or even exceeding human-level performance. However, these evaluations typically rely on standard in-distribution data, leaving the robustness of MLLMs largely unexamined when faced with scenarios that defy common-sense priors. To address this gap, we introduce VIA-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to probe model performance on visual illusions and anomalies. It includes six core categories: color illusions, motion illusions, gestalt illusions, geometric and spatial illusions, general visual illusions, and visual anomalies. Through careful human-in-the-loop review, we construct over 1K high-quality question-answer pairs that require nuanced visual reasoning. Extensive evaluation of over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning-enhanced models, uncovers significant vulnerabilities. Notably, we find that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning offers negligible robustness, often yielding ``brittle mirages'' where the model's logic collapses under illusory stimuli. Our findings reveal a fundamental divergence between machine and human perception, suggesting that resolving such perceptual bottlenecks is critical for the advancement of artificial general intelligence. The benchmark data and code will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ChemDCAT-AP: Enabling Semantic Interoperability with a Contextual Extension of DCAT-AP</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01822</link><description>arXiv:2602.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain data integration drives interdisciplinary data reuse and knowledge transfer across domains. However, each discipline maintains its own metadata schemas and domain ontologies, employing distinct conceptual models and application profiles, which complicates semantic interoperability. The W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) offers a widely adopted RDF vocabulary for describing datasets and their distributions, but its core model is intentionally lightweight. Numerous domain-specific application profiles have emerged to enrich DCAT's expressivity, the most well-known DCAT-AP for public data. To facilitate cross-domain interoperability for research data, we propose DCAT-AP PLUS, a DCAT Application Profile (P)roviding additional (L)inks to (U)se-case (S)pecific context (DCAT-AP+). This generic application profile enables a comprehensive representation of the provenance and context of research data generation.

Abstract: Credit scoring is an increasingly central and contested domain of data and AI governance, frequently framed as a neutral and objective method of assessing risk across diverse economic and political contexts. Based on a nine-month ethnography of credit scoring practices in Nairobi, Kenya, we examined the sociotechnical and institutional work of data science in digital lending. While established regional telcos and banks are leveraging proprietary data to develop digital loan products, algorithmic credit scoring is being transformed by new actors, techniques, and shifting regulations. Our findings show how practitioners construct alternative data using technical and legal workarounds, formulate risk through multiple interpretations, and negotiate model performance via technical and political means. We argue that algorithmic credit scoring is accomplished through the ongoing work of alignment that stabilizes risk under conditions of persistent uncertainty, taking epistemic, modeling, and contextual forms. Extending work on alignment in HCI, we show how it operates as a two-way translation, where models are made "safe for worlds" while those worlds are reshaped to be "safe for models."</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01824v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Precision: Training-Inference Mismatch is an Optimization Problem and Simple LR Scheduling Fixes It</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01826</link><description>arXiv:2602.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training Large Language Models is notoriously unstable. While recent studies attribute this to "training inference mismatch stemming" from inconsistent hybrid engines, standard remedies, such as Importance Sampling, might fail during extended training runs. In this work, we analyze this instability through the lens of optimization, demonstrating that gradient noise and training-inference mismatch escalate in tandem as training progresses. Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability. Empirical evidence suggests that by reducing the learning rate as gradient noise rises, we can consistently stabilize RL training and keep the training-inference mismatch at a safe level.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01826v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] In-Pipeline Integration of Digital In-Memory-Computing into RISC-V Vector Architecture to Accelerate Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01827</link><description>arXiv:2602.01827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding Deep Learning applications toward edge computing demands architectures capable of delivering high computational performance and efficiency while adhering to tight power and memory constraints. Digital In-Memory Computing (DIMC) addresses this need by moving part of the computation directly within memory arrays, significantly reducing data movement and improving energy efficiency. This paper introduces a novel architecture that extends the Vector RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to integrate a tightly coupled DIMC unit directly into the execution stage of the pipeline, to accelerate Deep Learning inference at the edge. Specifically, the proposed approach adds four custom instructions dedicated to data loading, computation, and write-back, enabling flexible and optimal control of the inference execution on the target architecture. Experimental results demonstrate high utilization of the DIMC tile in Vector RISC-V and sustained throughput across the ResNet-50 model, achieving a peak performance of 137 GOP/s. The proposed architecture achieves a speedup of 217x over the baseline core and 50x area-normalized speedup even when operating near the hardware resource limits. The experimental results confirm the high potential of the proposed architecture as a scalable and efficient solution to accelerate Deep Learning inference on the edge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks Under the Microscope: The Role of Geometry-Task Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01828</link><description>arXiv:2602.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex networks exhibit hyperbolic structural properties, making hyperbolic space a natural candidate for representing hierarchical and tree-like graphs with low distortion. Based on this observation, Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted as a principled choice for representation learning on tree-like graphs. In this work, we question this paradigm by proposing an additional condition of geometry-task alignment, i.e., whether the metric structure of the target follows that of the input graph. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the capability of HGNNs to recover low-distortion representations on two synthetic regression problems, and show that their geometric inductive bias becomes helpful when the problem requires preserving metric structure. Additionally, we evaluate HGNNs on the tasks of link prediction and node classification by jointly analyzing predictive performance and embedding distortion, revealing that only link prediction is geometry-aligned. Overall, our findings shift the focus from only asking "Is the graph hyperbolic?" to also questioning "Is the task aligned with hyperbolic geometry?", showing that HGNNs consistently outperform Euclidean models under such alignment, while their advantage vanishes otherwise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01828v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-Shot Knowledge Base Resizing for Rate-Adaptive Digital Semantic Communication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01829</link><description>arXiv:2602.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital semantic communication systems, which often leverage the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) framework, are pivotal for future wireless networks. In a VQ-VAE-based semantic communication system, the transmission rate is directly governed by the size of a discrete codebook known as knowledge base (KB). However, the KB size is a fixed hyperparameter, meaning that adapting the rate requires training and storing a separate model for each desired size -- a practice that is too computationally and storage-prohibitive to achieve truly granular rate control. To address this, we introduce a principled, zero-shot KB resizing method that enables on-the-fly rate adaptation without any retraining. Our approach establishes a global importance ranking for all vectors within a single, large parent KB by uncovering its inherent semantic hierarchy. This is achieved via a three-step framework: 1) embedding KB vectors into hyperbolic space to reveal their hierarchical relationships; 2) constructing a master semantic tree using a minimum spanning tree algorithm; 3) enabling instant resizing by iteratively pruning the least important leaf nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves reconstruction quality nearly identical to that of dedicated KBs trained from scratch, while demanding only a fraction of the computational budget. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior robustness at very low rates, where conventional KBs suffer from catastrophic failure. Our work resolves a fundamental limitation of VQ-VAE-based semantic communication systems, offering a practical and efficient path toward flexible and rate-adaptive semantic communication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01829v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synesthesia of Vehicles: Tactile Data Synthesis from Visual Inputs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01832</link><description>arXiv:2602.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on multi-modal fusion for safety, but current visual and optical sensors fail to detect road-induced excitations which are critical for vehicles' dynamic control. Inspired by human synesthesia, we propose the Synesthesia of Vehicles (SoV), a novel framework to predict tactile excitations from visual inputs for autonomous vehicles. We develop a cross-modal spatiotemporal alignment method to address temporal and spatial disparities. Furthermore, a visual-tactile synesthetic (VTSyn) generative model using latent diffusion is proposed for unsupervised high-quality tactile data synthesis. A real-vehicle perception system collected a multi-modal dataset across diverse road and lighting conditions. Extensive experiments show that VTSyn outperforms existing models in temporal, frequency, and classification performance, enhancing AV safety through proactive tactile perception.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01832v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mixture of Disentangled Experts with Missing Modalities for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01833</link><description>arXiv:2602.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) integrates multiple modalities to infer human sentiment, but real-world noise often leads to missing or corrupted data. However, existing feature-disentangled methods struggle to handle the internal variations of heterogeneous information under uncertain missingness, making it difficult to learn effective multimodal representations from degraded modalities. To address this issue, we propose DERL, a Disentangled Expert Representation Learning framework for robust MSA. Specifically, DERL employs hybrid experts to adaptively disentangle multimodal inputs into orthogonal private and shared representation spaces. A multi-level reconstruction strategy is further developed to provide collaborative supervision, enhancing both the expressiveness and robustness of the learned representations. Finally, the disentangled features act as modality experts with distinct roles to generate importance-aware fusion results. Extensive experiments on two MSA benchmarks demonstrate that DERL outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing-modality conditions. For instance, our method achieves improvements of 2.47% in Acc-2 and 2.25% in MAE on MOSI under intra-modal missingness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01833v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Concept-Based Dictionary Learning for Inference-Time Safety in Vision Language Action Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01834</link><description>arXiv:2602.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models close the perception action loop by translating multimodal instructions into executable behaviors, but this very capability magnifies safety risks: jailbreaks that merely yield toxic text in LLMs can trigger unsafe physical actions in embodied systems. Existing defenses alignment, filtering, or prompt hardening intervene too late or at the wrong modality, leaving fused representations exploitable. We introduce a concept-based dictionary learning framework for inference-time safety control. By constructing sparse, interpretable dictionaries from hidden activations, our method identifies harmful concept directions and applies threshold-based interventions to suppress or block unsafe activations. Experiments on Libero-Harm, BadRobot, RoboPair, and IS-Bench show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, cutting attack success rates by over 70\% while maintaining task success. Crucially, the framework is plug-in and model-agnostic, requiring no retraining and integrating seamlessly with diverse VLAs. To our knowledge, this is the first inference-time concept-based safety method for embodied systems, advancing both interpretability and safe deployment of VLA models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01834v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Cross-Country Data Acquisition Strategy for ADAS via Street-View Imagery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01836</link><description>arXiv:2602.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying ADAS and ADS across countries remains challenging due to differences in legislation, traffic infrastructure, and visual conventions, which introduce domain shifts that degrade perception performance. Traditional cross-country data collection relies on extensive on-road driving, making it costly and inefficient to identify representative locations. To address this, we propose a street-view-guided data acquisition strategy that leverages publicly available imagery to identify places of interest (POI). Two POI scoring methods are introduced: a KNN-based feature distance approach using a vision foundation model, and a visual-attribution approach using a vision-language model. To enable repeatable evaluation, we adopt a collect-detect protocol and construct a co-located dataset by pairing the Zenseact Open Dataset with Mapillary street-view images. Experiments on traffic sign detection, a task particularly sensitive to cross-country variations in sign appearance, show that our approach achieves performance comparable to random sampling while using only half of the target-domain data. We further provide cost estimations for full-country analysis, demonstrating that large-scale street-view processing remains economically feasible. These results highlight the potential of street-view-guided data acquisition for efficient and cost-effective cross-country model adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AXE: Low-Cost Cross-Domain Web Structured Information Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01838</link><description>arXiv:2602.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting structured data from the web is often a trade-off between the brittle nature of manual heuristics and the prohibitive cost of Large Language Models. We introduce AXE (Adaptive X-Path Extractor), a pipeline that rethinks this process by treating the HTML DOM as a tree that needs pruning rather than just a wall of text to be read. AXE uses a specialized "pruning" mechanism to strip away boilerplate and irrelevant nodes, leaving behind a distilled, high-density context that allows a tiny 0.6B LLM to generate precise, structured outputs. To keep the model honest, we implement Grounded XPath Resolution (GXR), ensuring every extraction is physically traceable to a source node. Despite its low footprint, AXE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, outperforming several much larger, fully-trained alternatives with an F1 score of 88.1% on the SWDE dataset. By releasing our specialized adaptors, we aim to provide a practical, cost-effective path for large-scale web information extraction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DOGMA: Weaving Structural Information into Data-centric Single-cell Transcriptomics Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01839</link><description>arXiv:2602.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, data-centric AI methodology has been a dominant paradigm in single-cell transcriptomics analysis, which treats data representation rather than model complexity as the fundamental bottleneck. In the review of current studies, earlier sequence methods treat cells as independent entities and adapt prevalent ML models to analyze their directly inherited sequence data. Despite their simplicity and intuition, these methods overlook the latent intercellular relationships driven by the functional mechanisms of biological systems and the inherent quality issues of the raw sequence data. Therefore, a series of structured methods has emerged. Although they employ various heuristic rules to capture intricate intercellular relationships and enhance the raw sequencing data, these methods often neglect biological prior knowledge. This omission incurs substantial overhead and yields suboptimal graph representations, thereby hindering the utility of ML models.
  To address them, we propose DOGMA, a holistic data-centric framework designed for the structural reshaping and semantic enhancement of raw data through multi-level biological prior knowledge. Transcending reliance on stochastic heuristics, DOGMA redefines graph construction by integrating Statistical Anchors with Cell Ontology and Phylogenetic Trees to enable deterministic structure discovery and robust cross-species alignment. Furthermore, Gene Ontology is utilized to bridge the feature-level semantic gap by incorporating functional priors. In complex multi-species and multi-organ benchmarks, DOGMA achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot robustness and sample efficiency while operating with significantly lower computational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01839v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Read As Human: Compressing Context via Parallelizable Close Reading and Skimming</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01840</link><description>arXiv:2602.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capability across diverse tasks. However, their deployment in long-context scenarios is hindered by two challenges: computational inefficiency and redundant information. We propose RAM (Read As HuMan), a context compression framework that adopts an adaptive hybrid reading strategy, to address these challenges. Inspired by human reading behavior (i.e., close reading important content while skimming less relevant content), RAM partitions the context into segments and encodes them with the input query in parallel. High-relevance segments are fully retained (close reading), while low-relevance ones are query-guided compressed into compact summary vectors (skimming). Both explicit textual segments and implicit summary vectors are concatenated and fed into decoder to achieve both superior performance and natural language format interpretability. To refine the decision boundary between close reading and skimming, we further introduce a contrastive learning objective based on positive and negative query-segment pairs. Experiments demonstrate that RAM outperforms existing baselines on multiple question answering and summarization benchmarks across two backbones, while delivering up to a 12x end-to-end speedup on long inputs (average length 16K; maximum length 32K).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prism: Efficient Test-Time Scaling via Hierarchical Search and Self-Verification for Discrete Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01842</link><description>arXiv:2602.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time compute has re-emerged as a practical way to improve LLM reasoning. Most test-time scaling (TTS) algorithms rely on autoregressive decoding, which is ill-suited to discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) due to their parallel decoding over the entire sequence. As a result, developing effective and efficient TTS methods to unlock dLLMs' full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose Prism (Pruning, Remasking, and Integrated Self-verification Method), an efficient TTS framework for dLLMs that (i) performs Hierarchical Trajectory Search (HTS) which dynamically prunes and reallocates compute in an early-to-mid denoising window, (ii) introduces Local branching with partial remasking to explore diverse implementations while preserving high-confidence tokens, and (iii) replaces external verifiers with Self-Verified Feedback (SVF) obtained via self-evaluation prompts on intermediate completions. Across four mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks on three dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B Instruct, Dream 7B Instruct, and LLaDA 2.0-mini, our Prism achieves a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off, matching best-of-N performance with substantially fewer function evaluations (NFE).

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is crucial for surveillance and early-warning, with deployments spanning both single-frame analysis and video-mode tracking. A practical solution should leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) to mitigate infrared data scarcity, while adopting a memory-attention-based temporal propagation framework that unifies single- and multi-frame inference. However, infrared small targets exhibit weak radiometric signals and limited semantic cues, which differ markedly from visible-spectrum imagery. This modality gap makes direct use of semantics-oriented VFMs and appearance-driven cross-frame association unreliable for IRSTD: hierarchical feature aggregation can submerge localized target peaks, and appearance-only memory attention becomes ambiguous, leading to spurious clutter associations. To address these challenges, we propose SPIRIT, a unified and VFM-compatible framework that adapts VFMs to IRSTD via lightweight physics-informed plug-ins. Spatially, PIFR refines features by approximating rank-sparsity decomposition to suppress structured background components and enhance sparse target-like signals. Temporally, PGMA injects history-derived soft spatial priors into memory cross-attention to constrain cross-frame association, enabling robust video detection while naturally reverting to single-frame inference when temporal context is absent. Experiments on multiple IRSTD benchmarks show consistent gains over VFM-based baselines and SOTA performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01843v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CloDS: Visual-Only Unsupervised Cloth Dynamics Learning in Unknown Conditions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01844</link><description>arXiv:2602.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in simulating complex dynamic systems. However, existing methods require known physical properties as supervision or inputs, limiting their applicability under unknown conditions. To explore this challenge, we introduce Cloth Dynamics Grounding (CDG), a novel scenario for unsupervised learning of cloth dynamics from multi-view visual observations. We further propose Cloth Dynamics Splatting (CloDS), an unsupervised dynamic learning framework designed for CDG. CloDS adopts a three-stage pipeline that first performs video-to-geometry grounding and then trains a dynamics model on the grounded meshes. To cope with large non-linear deformations and severe self-occlusions during grounding, we introduce a dual-position opacity modulation that supports bidirectional mapping between 2D observations and 3D geometry via mesh-based Gaussian splatting in video-to-geometry grounding stage. It jointly considers the absolute and relative position of Gaussian components. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CloDS effectively learns cloth dynamics from visual data while maintaining strong generalization capabilities for unseen configurations.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) face a fundamental divide: masked language models (MLMs) excel at fitness prediction while causal models enable generation, forcing practitioners to maintain separate architectures. We introduce \textbf{Proust}, a 309M-parameter causal PLM that bridges this gap through architectural innovations adapted from recent LLM research, including grouped-query attention with shared K/V projections, cross-layer value residuals, and depthwise causal convolutions. Trained on 33B tokens in 40 B200 GPU-hours, Proust achieves Spearman $\rho = 0.390$ on ProteinGym substitutions, competitive with MLMs requiring 50--200$\times$ the compute. On indels, Proust sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming models up to 20$\times$ larger. On EVEREST viral fitness benchmarks, it approaches structure-aware methods using sequence alone. These powerful representations position Proust in a sweet spot as it also retains native generative capabilities that MLMs lack by design. Interpretability analysis reveals that per-position entropy variance predicts, to an extent, when retrieval augmentation helps and hurts. Such insights can grow in both quantity and quality at scale and inform capabilities such as test-time scaling.

Abstract: In this paper we study two natural models of \textit{random temporal} graphs. In the first, the \textit{continuous} model, each edge $e$ is assigned $l_e$ labels, each drawn uniformly at random from $(0,1]$, where the numbers $l_e$ are independent random variables following the same discrete probability distribution. In the second, the \textit{discrete} model, the $l_e$ labels of each edge $e$ are chosen uniformly at random from a set $\{1,2,\ldots,T\}$. In both models we study the existence of \textit{$\delta$-temporal motifs}. Here a $\delta$-temporal motif consists of a pair $(H,P)$, where $H$ is a fixed static graph and $P$ is a partial order over its edges. A temporal graph $\mathcal{G}=(G,\lambda)$ contains $(H,P)$ as a $\delta$-temporal motif if $\mathcal{G}$ has a simple temporal subgraph on the edges of $H$ whose time labels are ordered according to $P$, and whose life duration is at most $\delta$. We prove \textit{sharp existence thresholds} for all $\delta$-temporal motifs, and we identify a qualitatively different behavior from the analogous static thresholds in Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Applying the same techniques, we then characterize the growth of the largest $\delta$-temporal clique in the continuous variant of our random temporal graphs model. Finally, we consider the \textit{doubling time} of the reachability ball centered on a small set of vertices of the random temporal graph as a natural proxy for temporal expansion. We prove \textit{sharp upper and lower bounds} for the maximum doubling time in the continuous model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ROMA: Recursive Open Meta-Agent Framework for Long-Horizon Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01848</link><description>arXiv:2602.01848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current agentic frameworks underperform on long-horizon tasks. As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\% over Kimi-Researcher. On EQ-Bench, a long-form writing benchmark, ROMA enables DeepSeek-V3 to match the performance of leading closed-source models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5. Our results demonstrate that recursive, modular agent architectures can scale reasoning depth while remaining interpretable, flexible, and model-agnostic.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01848v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Rewarding Sequential Monte Carlo for Masked Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01849</link><description>arXiv:2602.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents self-rewarding sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), an inference-time scaling algorithm enabling effective sampling of masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). Our algorithm stems from the observation that most existing MDLMs rely on a confidence-based sampling strategy, where only tokens with the highest prediction confidence are preserved at each step. This restricts the generation to a noise-sensitive, greedy decoding paradigm, resulting in an inevitable collapse in the diversity of possible paths. We address this problem by launching multiple interacting diffusion processes in parallel, referred to as particles, for trajectory exploration. Importantly, we introduce the trajectory-level confidence as a self-rewarding signal for assigning particle importance weights. During sampling, particles are iteratively weighted and resampled to systematically steer generation towards globally confident, high-quality samples. Our self-rewarding SMC is verified on various masked diffusion language models and benchmarks, achieving significant improvement without extra training or reward guidance, while effectively converting parallel inference capacity into improved sampling quality.

Abstract: IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has enabled a wide range of ubiquitous computing applications, yet its dominant clip classification paradigm cannot capture the rich temporal structure of real-world behaviors. This motivates a shift toward IMU Temporal Action Localization (IMU-TAL), which predicts both action categories and their start/end times in continuous streams. However, current progress is strongly bottlenecked by the need for dense, frame-level boundary annotations, which are costly and difficult to scale. To address this bottleneck, we introduce WS-IMUBench, a systematic benchmark study of weakly supervised IMU-TAL (WS-IMU-TAL) under only sequence-level labels. Rather than proposing a new localization algorithm, we evaluate how well established weakly supervised localization paradigms from audio, image, and video transfer to IMU-TAL under only sequence-level labels. We benchmark seven representative weakly supervised methods on seven public IMU datasets, resulting in over 3,540 model training runs and 7,080 inference evaluations. Guided by three research questions on transferability, effectiveness, and insights, our findings show that (i) transfer is modality-dependent, with temporal-domain methods generally more stable than image-derived proposal-based approaches; (ii) weak supervision can be competitive on favorable datasets (e.g., with longer actions and higher-dimensional sensing); and (iii) dominant failure modes arise from short actions, temporal ambiguity, and proposal quality. Finally, we outline concrete directions for advancing WS-IMU-TAL (e.g., IMU-specific proposal generation, boundary-aware objectives, and stronger temporal reasoning). Beyond individual results, WS-IMUBench establishes a reproducible benchmarking template, datasets, protocols, and analyses, to accelerate community-wide progress toward scalable WS-IMU-TAL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01850v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Well Do Models Follow Visual Instructions? VIBE: A Systematic Benchmark for Visual Instruction-Driven Image Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01851</link><description>arXiv:2602.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generative models have achieved remarkable progress in image editing. However, existing systems and benchmarks remain largely text-guided. In contrast, human communication is inherently multimodal, where visual instructions such as sketches efficiently convey spatial and structural intent. To address this gap, we introduce VIBE, the Visual Instruction Benchmark for Image Editing with a three-level interaction hierarchy that captures deictic grounding, morphological manipulation, and causal reasoning. Across these levels, we curate high-quality and diverse test cases that reflect progressively increasing complexity in visual instruction following. We further propose a robust LMM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with task-specific metrics to enable scalable and fine-grained assessment. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 17 representative open-source and proprietary image editing models, we find that proprietary models exhibit early-stage visual instruction-following capabilities and consistently outperform open-source models. However, performance degrades markedly with increasing task difficulty even for the strongest systems, highlighting promising directions for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01851v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FUPareto: Bridging the Forgetting-Utility Gap in Federated Unlearning via Pareto Augmented Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01852</link><description>arXiv:2602.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific client data from a federated model while preserving utility for the remaining clients. However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Designing Time Series Experiments in A/B Testing with Transformer Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01853</link><description>arXiv:2602.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A/B testing has become a gold standard for modern technological companies to conduct policy evaluation. Yet, its application to time series experiments, where policies are sequentially assigned over time, remains challenging. Existing designs suffer from two limitations: (i) they do not fully leverage the entire history for treatment allocation; (ii) they rely on strong assumptions to approximate the objective function (e.g., the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect) for optimizing the design. We first establish an impossibility theorem showing that failure to condition on the full history leads to suboptimal designs, due to the dynamic dependencies in time series experiments. To address both limitations simultaneously, we next propose a transformer reinforcement learning (RL) approach which leverages transformers to condition allocation on the entire history and employs RL to directly optimize the MSE without relying on restrictive assumptions. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data, a publicly available dispatch simulator, and a real-world ridesharing dataset demonstrate that our proposal consistently outperforms existing designs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01853v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fact or Fake? Assessing the Role of Deepfake Detectors in Multimodal Misinformation Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01854</link><description>arXiv:2602.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multimodal misinformation, deception usually arises not just from pixel-level manipulations in an image, but from the semantic and contextual claim jointly expressed by the image-text pair. Yet most deepfake detectors, engineered to detect pixel-level forgeries, do not account for claim-level meaning, despite their growing integration in automated fact-checking (AFC) pipelines. This raises a central scientific and practical question: Do pixel-level detectors contribute useful signal for verifying image-text claims, or do they instead introduce misleading authenticity priors that undermine evidence-based reasoning? We provide the first systematic analysis of deepfake detectors in the context of multimodal misinformation detection. Using two complementary benchmarks, MMFakeBench and DGM4, we evaluate: (1) state-of-the-art image-only deepfake detectors, (2) an evidence-driven fact-checking system that performs tool-guided retrieval via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and engages in deliberative inference through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), and (3) a hybrid fact-checking system that injects detector outputs as auxiliary evidence. Results across both benchmark datasets show that deepfake detectors offer limited standalone value, achieving F1 scores in the range of 0.26-0.53 on MMFakeBench and 0.33-0.49 on DGM4, and that incorporating their predictions into fact-checking pipelines consistently reduces performance by 0.04-0.08 F1 due to non-causal authenticity assumptions. In contrast, the evidence-centric fact-checking system achieves the highest performance, reaching F1 scores of approximately 0.81 on MMFakeBench and 0.55 on DGM4. Overall, our findings demonstrate that multimodal claim verification is driven primarily by semantic understanding and external evidence, and that pixel-level artifact signals do not reliably enhance reasoning over real-world image-text misinformation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01854v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Time2Vec-Integrated Transformer for Robust Gesture Recognition from Low-Density sEMG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01855</link><description>arXiv:2602.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and responsive myoelectric prosthesis control typically relies on complex, dense multi-sensor arrays, which limits consumer accessibility. This paper presents a novel, data-efficient deep learning framework designed to achieve precise and accurate control using minimal sensor hardware. Leveraging an external dataset of 8 subjects, our approach implements a hybrid Transformer optimized for sparse, two-channel surface electromyography (sEMG). Unlike standard architectures that use fixed positional encodings, we integrate Time2Vec learnable temporal embeddings to capture the stochastic temporal warping inherent in biological signals. Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations. A two-stage curriculum learning protocol is utilized to ensure robust feature extraction despite data scarcity. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-the-art multi-subject F1-score of 95.7% $\pm$ 0.20% for a 10-class movement set, statistically outperforming both a standard Transformer with fixed encodings and a recurrent CNN-LSTM model. Architectural optimization reveals that a balanced allocation of model capacity between spatial and temporal dimensions yields the highest stability. Furthermore, while direct transfer to a new unseen subject led to poor accuracy due to domain shifts, a rapid calibration protocol utilizing only two trials per gesture recovered performance from 21.0% $\pm$ 2.98% to 96.9% $\pm$ 0.52%. By validating that high-fidelity temporal embeddings can compensate for low spatial resolution, this work challenges the necessity of high-density sensing. The proposed framework offers a robust, cost-effective blueprint for next-generation prosthetic interfaces capable of rapid personalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Preservation Theorems for Unravelling-Invariant Classes: A Uniform Approach for Modal Logics and Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01856</link><description>arXiv:2602.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study preservation theorems for modal logics over finite structures with respect to three fundamental semantic relations: embeddings, injective homomorphisms, and homomorphisms. We focus on classes of pointed Kripke models that are invariant under bounded unravellings, a natural locality condition satisfied by modal logics and by graph neural networks (GNNs). We show that preservation under embeddings coincides with definability in existential graded modal logic; preservation under injective homomorphisms with definability in existential positive graded modal logic; and preservation under homomorphisms with definability in existential positive modal logic. A key technical contribution is a structural well-quasi-ordering result. We prove that the embedding relation on classes of tree-shaped models of uniformly bounded height forms a well-quasi-order, and that the bounded-height assumption is essential. This well-quasi-ordering yields a finite minimal-tree argument leading to explicit syntactic characterisations via finite disjunctions of (graded) modal formulae.
  As an application, we derive consequences for the expressive power of GNNs. Using our preservation theorem for injective homomorphisms, we obtain a new logical characterisation of monotonic GNNs, showing that they capture exactly existential-positive graded modal logic, while monotonic GNNs with MAX aggregation correspond precisely to existential-positive modal logic.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01856v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Super-twisting over networks: A Lyapunov approach for distributed differentiation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01857</link><description>arXiv:2602.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distributed differentiation, where agents in a networked system estimate the average of local time-varying signals and their derivatives under mild assumptions on the agents' signals and their first and second derivatives. Existing sliding-mode methods provide only local stability guarantees and lack systematic gain selection. By isolating the structural features shared with the super-twisting algorithm and encoding them into an abstract model, we construct a Lyapunov function enabling systematic gain design and proving global finite-time convergence to consensus for the distributed differentiator. Building on this framework, we develop an event-triggered hybrid system implementation using time-varying and state dependent threshold rules and derive minimum inter-event time guarantees and accuracy bounds that quantify the trade-off between estimation accuracy and communication effort.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01857v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SOPRAG: Multi-view Graph Experts Retrieval for Industrial Standard Operating Procedures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01858</link><description>arXiv:2602.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are essential for ensuring operational safety and consistency in industrial environments. However, retrieving and following these procedures presents unique challenges, such as rigid proprietary structures, condition-dependent relevance, and actionable execution requirement, which standard semantic-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms fail to address. Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, we propose SOPRAG, a novel framework specifically designed to address the above pain points in SOP retrieval. SOPRAG replaces flat chunking with specialized Entity, Causal, and Flow graph experts to resolve industrial structural and logical complexities. To optimize and coordinate these experts, we propose a Procedure Card layer that prunes the search space to eliminate computational noise, and an LLM-Guided gating mechanism that dynamically weights these experts to align retrieval with operator intent. To address the scarcity of domain-specific data, we also introduce an automated, multi-agent workflow for benchmark construction. Extensive experiments across four industrial domains demonstrate that SOPRAG significantly outperforms strong lexical, dense, and graph-based RAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response utility, achieving perfect execution scores in real-world critical tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision-only UAV State Estimation for Fast Flights Without External Localization Systems: A2RL Drone Racing Finalist Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01860</link><description>arXiv:2602.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast flights with aggressive maneuvers in cluttered GNSS-denied environments require fast, reliable, and accurate UAV state estimation. In this paper, we present an approach for onboard state estimation of a high-speed UAV using a monocular RGB camera and an IMU. Our approach fuses data from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), an onboard landmark-based camera measurement system, and an IMU to produce an accurate state estimate. Using onboard measurement data, we estimate and compensate for VIO drift through a novel mathematical drift model. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on more complex hardware (e.g., stereo cameras or rangefinders) and use uncorrected drifting VIO velocities, orientation, and angular rates, leading to errors during fast maneuvers. In contrast, our method corrects all VIO states (position, orientation, linear and angular velocity), resulting in accurate state estimation even during rapid and dynamic motion. Our approach was thoroughly validated through 1600 simulations and numerous real-world experiments. Furthermore, we applied the proposed method in the A2RL Drone Racing Challenge 2025, where our team advanced to the final four out of 210 teams and earned a medal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01860v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trust but Verify: Adaptive Conditioning for Reference-Based Diffusion Super-Resolution via Implicit Reference Correlation Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01864</link><description>arXiv:2602.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have explored reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) to mitigate hallucinations in diffusion-based image restoration. A key challenge is that real-world degradations make correspondences between low-quality (LQ) inputs and reference (Ref) images unreliable, requiring adaptive control of reference usage. Existing methods either ignore LQ-Ref correlations or rely on brittle explicit matching, leading to over-reliance on misleading references or under-utilization of valuable cues. To address this, we propose Ada-RefSR, a single-step diffusion framework guided by a "Trust but Verify" principle: reference information is leveraged when reliable and suppressed otherwise. Its core component, Adaptive Implicit Correlation Gating (AICG), employs learnable summary tokens to distill dominant reference patterns and capture implicit correlations with LQ features. Integrated into the attention backbone, AICG provides lightweight, adaptive regulation of reference guidance, serving as a built-in safeguard against erroneous fusion. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that Ada-RefSR achieves a strong balance of fidelity, naturalness, and efficiency, while remaining robust under varying reference alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01864v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GRAB: An LLM-Inspired Sequence-First Click-Through Rate Prediction Modeling Paradigm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01865</link><description>arXiv:2602.01865v1 Announce Type: new

Furthermore, the model demonstrates desirable scaling behavior: its expressive power shows a monotonic and approximately linear improvement as longer interaction sequences are utilized.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01865v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProcMEM: Learning Reusable Procedural Memory from Experience via Non-Parametric PPO for LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01869</link><description>arXiv:2602.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-driven agents demonstrate strong performance in sequential decision-making but often rely on on-the-fly reasoning, re-deriving solutions even in recurring scenarios. This insufficient experience reuse leads to computational redundancy and execution instability. To bridge this gap, we propose ProcMEM, a framework that enables agents to autonomously learn procedural memory from interaction experiences without parameter updates. By formalizing a Skill-MDP, ProcMEM transforms passive episodic narratives into executable Skills defined by activation, execution, and termination conditions to ensure executability. To achieve reliable reusability without capability degradation, we introduce Non-Parametric PPO, which leverages semantic gradients for high-quality candidate generation and a PPO Gate for robust Skill verification. Through score-based maintenance, ProcMEM sustains compact, high-quality procedural memory. Experimental results across in-domain, cross-task, and cross-agent scenarios demonstrate that ProcMEM achieves superior reuse rates and significant performance gains with extreme memory compression. Visualized evolutionary trajectories and Skill distributions further reveal how ProcMEM transparently accumulates, refines, and reuses procedural knowledge to facilitate long-term autonomy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BTGenBot-2: Efficient Behavior Tree Generation with Small Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01870</link><description>arXiv:2602.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in robot learning increasingly rely on LLM-based task planning, leveraging their ability to bridge natural language with executable actions. While prior works showcased great performances, the widespread adoption of these models in robotics has been challenging as 1) existing methods are often closed-source or computationally intensive, neglecting the actual deployment on real-world physical systems, and 2) there is no universally accepted, plug-and-play representation for robotic task generation. Addressing these challenges, we propose BTGenBot-2, a 1B-parameter open-source small language model that directly converts natural language task descriptions and a list of robot action primitives into executable behavior trees in XML. Unlike prior approaches, BTGenBot-2 enables zero-shot BT generation, error recovery at inference and runtime, while remaining lightweight enough for resource-constrained robots. We further introduce the first standardized benchmark for LLM-based BT generation, covering 52 navigation and manipulation tasks in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that BTGenBot-2 consistently outperforms GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and larger open-source models across both functional and non-functional metrics, achieving average success rates of 90.38% in zero-shot and 98.07% in one-shot, while delivering up to 16x faster inference compared to the previous BTGenBot.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01870v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01872</link><description>arXiv:2602.01872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01872v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tidehunter: Large-Value Storage With Minimal Data Relocation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01873</link><description>arXiv:2602.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log-Structured Merge-Trees (LSM-trees) dominate persistent key-value storage but suffer from high write amplification from 10x to 30x under random workloads due to repeated compaction. This overhead becomes prohibitive for large values with uniformly distributed keys, a workload common in content-addressable storage, deduplication systems, and blockchain validators. We present Tidehunter, a storage engine that eliminates value compaction by treating the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) as permanent storage rather than a temporary recovery buffer. Values are never overwritten; and small, lazily-flushed index tables map keys to WAL positions. Tidehunter introduces (a) lock-free writes that saturate NVMe drives through atomic allocation and parallel copying, (b) an optimistic index structure that exploits uniform key distributions for single-roundtrip lookups, and (c) epoch-based pruning that reclaims space without blocking writes. On a 1 TB dataset with 1 KB values, Tidehunter achieves 830K writes per second, that is 8.4x higher than RocksDB and 2.9x higher than BlobDB, while improving point queries by 1.7x and existence checks by 15.6x. We validate real-world impact by integrating Tidehunter into Sui, a high-throughput blockchain, where it maintains stable throughput and latency under loads that cause RocksDB-backed validators to collapse. Tidehunter is production-ready and is being deployed in production within Sui.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01873v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PretrainRL: Alleviating Factuality Hallucination of Large Language Models at the Beginning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01875</link><description>arXiv:2602.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their powerful capabilities, suffer from factual hallucinations where they generate verifiable falsehoods. We identify a root of this issue: the imbalanced data distribution in the pretraining corpus, which leads to a state of "low-probability truth" and "high-probability falsehood". Recent approaches, such as teaching models to say "I don't know" or post-hoc knowledge editing, either evade the problem or face catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue from its root, we propose \textbf{PretrainRL}, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning into the pretraining phase to consolidate factual knowledge. The core principle of PretrainRL is "\textbf{debiasing then learning}." It actively reshapes the model's probability distribution by down-weighting high-probability falsehoods, thereby making "room" for low-probability truths to be learned effectively. To enable this, we design an efficient negative sampling strategy to discover these high-probability falsehoods and introduce novel metrics to evaluate the model's probabilistic state concerning factual knowledge. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that PretrainRL significantly alleviates factual hallucinations and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01875v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PINN-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with RAR-D Adaptive Sampling for Solving Elliptic Interface Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01876</link><description>arXiv:2602.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular and powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), leveraging neural networks to approximate solutions while embedding PDE constraints, boundary conditions, and interface jump conditions directly into the loss function. However, most existing PINN approaches are based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which may require large network sizes and extensive training to achieve high accuracy, especially for complex interface problems. In this work, we propose a novel PINN architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which offer greater flexibility in choosing activation functions and can represent functions with fewer parameters. Specifically, we introduce a dual KANs structure that couples two KANs across subdomains and explicitly enforces interface conditions. To further boost training efficiency and convergence, we integrate the RAR-D adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically refine training points. Numerical experiments on the elliptic interface problems yield more uniform error distributions across the computational domain, which demonstrates that our PINN-based KANs achieve superior accuracy with significantly smaller network sizes and faster convergence compared to standard PINNs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01876v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autocorrelated Optimize-via-Estimate: Predict-then-Optimize versus Finite-sample Optimal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01877</link><description>arXiv:2602.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models that directly optimize for out-of-sample performance in the finite-sample regime have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional estimate-then-optimize approaches in data-driven optimization. In this work, we compare their performance in the context of autocorrelated uncertainties, specifically, under a Vector Autoregressive Moving Average VARMA(p,q) process. We propose an autocorrelated Optimize-via-Estimate (A-OVE) model that obtains an out-of-sample optimal solution as a function of sufficient statistics, and propose a recursive form for computing its sufficient statistics. We evaluate these models on a portfolio optimization problem with trading costs. A-OVE achieves low regret relative to a perfect information oracle, outperforming predict-then-optimize machine learning benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generating multi-speaker speech without relying on any audible inputs. Our approach leverages silent electromyography (EMG) signals to capture linguistic content, while facial images are used to match with the vocal identity of the target speaker. Notably, we present a pitch-disentangled content embedding that enhances the extraction of linguistic content from EMG signals. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our method can generate multi-speaker speech without any audible inputs and confirms the effectiveness of the proposed pitch-disentanglement approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01879v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Large Language Models for Real-Time Situated Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01880</link><description>arXiv:2602.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models can support real-time context- and value-aware decision-making. To do so, we combine the GPT-4o language model with a TurtleBot 4 platform simulating a smart vacuum cleaning robot in a home. The model evaluates the environment through vision input and determines whether it is appropriate to initiate cleaning. The system highlights the ability of these models to reason about domestic activities, social norms, and user preferences and take nuanced decisions aligned with the values of the people involved, such as cleanliness, comfort, and safety. We demonstrate the system in a realistic home environment, showing its ability to infer context and values from limited visual input. Our results highlight the promise of multimodal large language models in enhancing robotic autonomy and situational awareness, while also underscoring challenges related to consistency, bias, and real-time performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProxyImg: Towards Highly-Controllable Image Representation via Hierarchical Disentangled Proxy Embedding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01881</link><description>arXiv:2602.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing image representation methods, including explicit representations such as raster images and Gaussian primitives, as well as implicit representations such as latent images, either suffer from representation redundancy that leads to heavy manual editing effort, or lack a direct mapping from latent variables to semantic instances or parts, making fine-grained manipulation difficult. These limitations hinder efficient and controllable image and video editing. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical proxy-based parametric image representation that disentangles semantic, geometric, and textural attributes into independent and manipulable parameter spaces. Based on a semantic-aware decomposition of the input image, our representation constructs hierarchical proxy geometries through adaptive Bezier fitting and iterative internal region subdivision and meshing. Multi-scale implicit texture parameters are embedded into the resulting geometry-aware distributed proxy nodes, enabling continuous high-fidelity reconstruction in the pixel domain and instance- or part-independent semantic editing. In addition, we introduce a locality-adaptive feature indexing mechanism to ensure spatial texture coherence, which further supports high-quality background completion without relying on generative models. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and editing benchmarks, including ImageNet, OIR-Bench, and HumanEdit, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering fidelity with significantly fewer parameters, while enabling intuitive, interactive, and physically plausible manipulation. Moreover, by integrating proxy nodes with Position-Based Dynamics, our framework supports real-time physics-driven animation using lightweight implicit rendering, achieving superior temporal consistency and visual realism compared with generative approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01881v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convergence of high-index saddle dynamics for degenerate saddle points on critical manifolds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01883</link><description>arXiv:2602.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-index saddle dynamics (HiSD) method provides a powerful framework for finding saddle points and constructing solution landscapes. While originally derived for nondegenerate critical points, HiSD has demonstrated empirical success in degenerate cases, where the Hessian matrix exhibits zero eigenvalues. However, the mathematical and numerical analysis of HiSD for degenerate saddle points remains unexplored. In this paper, utilizing Morse-Bott functions, we present a rigorous analysis of HiSD for computing degenerate saddle points on a critical manifold. We prove the local convergence of the continuous HiSD and establish the linear convergence rate of the discrete HiSD algorithm. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the gradient alignment tendency, revealing that the gradient direction asymptotically aligns with a specific Hessian eigenvector. Our analysis also elucidates the flexibility in selecting the index for HiSD in the context of degenerate saddle points. We validate our analytical results through numerical experiments on neural-network loss landscapes and demonstrate that momentum-accelerated variants of HiSD achieve rapid convergence to degenerate saddle points.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01883v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entropy-Guided Data-Efficient Training for Multimodal Reasoning Reward Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01884</link><description>arXiv:2602.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal reward models are crucial for aligning multimodal large language models with human preferences. Recent works have incorporated reasoning capabilities into these models, achieving promising results. However, training these models suffers from two critical challenges: (1) the inherent noise in preference datasets, which degrades model performance, and (2) the inefficiency of conventional training methods, which ignore the differences in sample difficulty. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between response entropy and accuracy, indicating that entropy can serve as a reliable and unsupervised proxy for annotation noise and sample difficulty. Based on this insight, we propose a novel Entropy-Guided Training (EGT) approach for multimodal reasoning reward models, which combines two strategies: (1) entropy-guided data curation to mitigate the impact of unreliable samples, and (2) an entropy-guided training strategy that progressively introduces more complex examples. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks show that the EGT-trained model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal reward models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01884v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ES-MemEval: Benchmarking Conversational Agents on Personalized Long-Term Emotional Support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01885</link><description>arXiv:2602.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential as conversational agents. Yet, their effectiveness remains limited by deficiencies in robust long-term memory, particularly in complex, long-term web-based services such as online emotional support. However, existing long-term dialogue benchmarks primarily focus on static and explicit fact retrieval, failing to evaluate agents in critical scenarios where user information is dispersed, implicit, and continuously evolving. To address this gap, we introduce ES-MemEval, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates five core memory capabilities: information extraction, temporal reasoning, conflict detection, abstention, and user modeling, in long-term emotional support settings, covering question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation tasks. To support the benchmark, we also propose EvoEmo, a multi-session dataset for personalized long-term emotional support that captures fragmented, implicit user disclosures and evolving user states. Extensive experiments on open-source long-context, commercial, and retrieval-augmented (RAG) LLMs show that explicit long-term memory is essential for reducing hallucinations and enabling effective personalization. At the same time, RAG improves factual consistency but struggles with temporal dynamics and evolving user states. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current paradigms and motivate more robust integration of memory and retrieval for long-term personalized dialogue systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01885v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geometric Analysis of Token Selection in Multi-Head Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01893</link><description>arXiv:2602.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric framework for analysing multi-head attention in large language models (LLMs). Without altering the mechanism, we view standard attention through a top-N selection lens and study its behaviour directly in value-state space. We define geometric metrics - Precision, Recall, and F-score - to quantify separability between selected and non-selected tokens, and derive non-asymptotic bounds with explicit dependence on dimension and margin under empirically motivated assumptions (stable value norms with a compressed sink token, exponential similarity decay, and piecewise attention weight profiles). The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall. We also found that in LLaMA-2-7B heads specialize into three regimes - Retriever, Mixer, Reset - with distinct geometric signatures. Overall, attention behaves as a structured geometric classifier with measurable criteria for token selection, offering head level interpretability and informing geometry-aware sparsification and design of attention in LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01893v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Internal Flow Signatures for Self-Checking and Refinement in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01897</link><description>arXiv:2602.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models can generate fluent answers that are unfaithful to the provided context, while many safeguards rely on external verification or a separate judge after generation. We introduce \emph{internal flow signatures} that audit decision formation from depthwise dynamics at a fixed inter-block monitoring boundary. The method stabilizes token-wise motion via bias-centered monitoring, then summarizes trajectories in compact \emph{moving} readout-aligned subspaces constructed from the top token and its close competitors within each depth window. Neighboring window frames are aligned by an orthogonal transport, yielding depth-comparable transported step lengths, turning angles, and subspace drift summaries that are invariant to within-window basis choices. A lightweight GRU validator trained on these signatures performs self-checking without modifying the base model. Beyond detection, the validator localizes a culprit depth event and enables a targeted refinement: the model rolls back to the culprit token and clamps an abnormal transported step at the identified block while preserving the orthogonal residual. The resulting pipeline provides actionable localization and low-overhead self-checking from internal decision dynamics. \emph{Code is available at} \texttt{github.com/EavnJeong/Internal-Flow-Signatures-for-Self-Checking-and-Refinement-in-LLMs}.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01897v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Observation-dependent Bayesian active learning via input-warped Gaussian processes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01898</link><description>arXiv:2602.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian active learning relies on the precise quantification of predictive uncertainty to explore unknown function landscapes. While Gaussian process surrogates are the standard for such tasks, an underappreciated fact is that their posterior variance depends on the observed outputs only through the hyperparameters, rendering exploration largely insensitive to the actual measurements. We propose to inject observation-dependent feedback by warping the input space with a learned, monotone reparameterization. This mechanism allows the design policy to expand or compress regions of the input space in response to observed variability, thereby shaping the behavior of variance-based acquisition functions. We demonstrate that while such warps can be trained via marginal likelihood, a novel self-supervised objective yields substantially better performance. Our approach improves sample efficiency across a range of active learning benchmarks, particularly in regimes where non-stationarity challenges traditional methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01898v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Task Learning for Robot Perception with Imbalanced Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01899</link><description>arXiv:2602.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task problem solving has been shown to improve the accuracy of the individual tasks, which is an important feature for robots, as they have a limited resource. However, when the number of labels for each task is not equal, namely imbalanced data exist, a problem may arise due to insufficient number of samples, and labeling is not very easy for mobile robots in every environment. We propose a method that can learn tasks even in the absence of the ground truth labels for some of the tasks. We also provide a detailed analysis of the proposed method. An interesting finding is related to the interaction of the tasks. We show a methodology to find out which tasks can improve the performance of other tasks. We investigate this by training the teacher network with the task outputs such as depth as inputs. We further provide empirical evidence when trained with a small amount of data. We use semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks on different datasets, NYUDv2 and Cityscapes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Q Cache: Visual Attention is Valuable in Less than Half of Decode Layers for Multimodal Large Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01901</link><description>arXiv:2602.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are plagued by exorbitant inference costs attributable to the profusion of visual tokens within the vision encoder. The redundant visual tokens engenders a substantial computational load and key-value (KV) cache footprint bottleneck. Existing approaches focus on token-wise optimization, leveraging diverse intricate token pruning techniques to eliminate non-crucial visual tokens. Nevertheless, these methods often unavoidably undermine the integrity of the KV cache, resulting in failures in long-text generation tasks. To this end, we conduct an in-depth investigation towards the attention mechanism of the model from a new perspective, and discern that attention within more than half of all decode layers are semantic similar. Upon this finding, we contend that the attention in certain layers can be streamlined by inheriting the attention from their preceding layers. Consequently, we propose Lazy Attention, an efficient attention mechanism that enables cross-layer sharing of similar attention patterns. It ingeniously reduces layer-wise redundant computation in attention. In Lazy Attention, we develop a novel layer-shared cache, Q Cache, tailored for MLLMs, which facilitates the reuse of queries across adjacent layers. In particular, Q Cache is lightweight and fully compatible with existing inference frameworks, including Flash Attention and KV cache. Additionally, our method is highly flexible as it is orthogonal to existing token-wise techniques and can be deployed independently or combined with token pruning approaches. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method can reduce KV cache usage by over 35% and achieve 1.5x throughput improvement, while sacrificing only approximately 1% of performance on various MLLMs. Compared with SOTA token-wise methods, our technique achieves superior accuracy preservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01901v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data- and Variance-dependent Regret Bounds for Online Tabular MDPs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01903</link><description>arXiv:2602.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies online episodic tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with known transitions and develops best-of-both-worlds algorithms that achieve refined data-dependent regret bounds in the adversarial regime and variance-dependent regret bounds in the stochastic regime. We quantify MDP complexity using a first-order quantity and several new data-dependent measures for the adversarial regime, including a second-order quantity and a path-length measure, as well as variance-based measures for the stochastic regime. To adapt to these measures, we develop algorithms based on global optimization and policy optimization, both built on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with log-barrier regularization. For global optimization, our algorithms achieve first-order, second-order, and path-length regret bounds in the adversarial regime, and in the stochastic regime, they achieve a variance-aware gap-independent bound and a variance-aware gap-dependent bound that is polylogarithmic in the number of episodes. For policy optimization, our algorithms achieve the same data- and variance-dependent adaptivity, up to a factor of the episode horizon, by exploiting a new optimistic $Q$-function estimator. Finally, we establish regret lower bounds in terms of data-dependent complexity measures for the adversarial regime and a variance measure for the stochastic regime, implying that the regret upper bounds achieved by the global-optimization approach are nearly optimal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01903v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Sparse Visual Representations via Spatial-Semantic Factorization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01905</link><description>arXiv:2602.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) faces a fundamental conflict between semantic understanding and image reconstruction. High-level semantic SSL (e.g., DINO) relies on global tokens that are forced to be location-invariant for augmentation alignment, a process that inherently discards the spatial coordinates required for reconstruction. Conversely, generative SSL (e.g., MAE) preserves dense feature grids for reconstruction but fails to produce high-level abstractions. We introduce STELLAR, a framework that resolves this tension by factorizing visual features into a low-rank product of semantic concepts and their spatial distributions. This disentanglement allows us to perform DINO-style augmentation alignment on the semantic tokens while maintaining the precise spatial mapping in the localization matrix necessary for pixel-level reconstruction. We demonstrate that as few as 16 sparse tokens under this factorized form are sufficient to simultaneously support high-quality reconstruction (2.60 FID) and match the semantic performance of dense backbones (79.10% ImageNet accuracy). Our results highlight STELLAR as a versatile sparse representation that bridges the gap between discriminative and generative vision by strategically separating semantic identity from spatial geometry.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) is a challenging task due to high spectral dimensionality, complex spectral-spatial correlations, and limited labeled training samples. Although transformer-based models have shown strong potential for HSIC, existing approaches often struggle to achieve sufficient spectral discriminability while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DSXFormer, a novel dual-pooling spectral squeeze-expansion transformer with Dynamic Context Attention for HSIC. The proposed DSXFormer introduces a Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion (DSX) block, which exploits complementary global average and max pooling to adaptively recalibrate spectral feature channels, thereby enhancing spectral discriminability and inter-band dependency modeling. In addition, DSXFormer incorporates a Dynamic Context Attention (DCA) mechanism within a window-based transformer architecture to dynamically capture local spectral-spatial relationships while significantly reducing computational overhead. The joint integration of spectral dual-pooling squeeze-expansion and DCA enables DSXFormer to achieve an effective balance between spectral emphasis and spatial contextual representation. Furthermore, patch extraction, embedding, and patch merging strategies are employed to facilitate efficient multi-scale feature learning. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used hyperspectral benchmark datasets, including Salinas (SA), Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), demonstrate that DSXFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving classification accuracies of 99.95%, 98.91%, 99.85%, and 98.52%, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LipSody: Lip-to-Speech Synthesis with Enhanced Prosody Consistency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01908</link><description>arXiv:2602.01908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lip-to-speech synthesis aims to generate speech audio directly from silent facial video by reconstructing linguistic content from lip movements, providing valuable applications in situations where audio signals are unavailable or degraded. While recent diffusion-based models such as LipVoicer have demonstrated impressive performance in reconstructing linguistic content, they often lack prosodic consistency.

Experimental results demonstrate that LipSody substantially improves prosody-related metrics, including global and local pitch deviations, energy consistency, and speaker similarity, compared to prior approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DomusFM: A Foundation Model for Smart-Home Sensor Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01910</link><description>arXiv:2602.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart-home sensor data holds significant potential for several applications, including healthcare monitoring and assistive technologies. Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning. Our approach addresses data scarcity while maintaining practical deployability for real-world smart-home systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01910v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Learning Meets Random Access: Energy-Efficient Uplink Resource Allocation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01913</link><description>arXiv:2602.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-generated traffic is changing the shape of wireless networks. Specifically, as the amount of data generated to train machine learning models is massive, network resources must be carefully allocated to continue supporting standard applications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of allocating radio resources for two sets of concurrent devices communicating in uplink with a gateway over the same bandwidth. A set of devices performs federated learning (FL), and accesses the medium in FDMA, uploading periodically large models. The other set is throughput-oriented and accesses the medium via random access (RA), either with ALOHA or slotted-ALOHA protocols. We derive close-to-optimal solutions to the non-convex problem of minimizing the system energy consumption subject to FL latency and RA throughput constraints. Our solutions show that ALOHA can sustain high FL efficiency, yielding up to 48% lower consumption when the system is dominated by FL traffic. On the other hand, slotted-ALOHA becomes more efficient when RA traffic dominates, yielding 6% lower consumption.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01913v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Long-Horizon Interpretability: Efficient and Faithful Multi-Token Attribution for Reasoning LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01914</link><description>arXiv:2602.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Token attribution methods provide intuitive explanations for language model outputs by identifying causally important input tokens. However, as modern LLMs increasingly rely on extended reasoning chains, existing schemes face two critical challenges: (1) efficiency bottleneck, where attributing a target span of M tokens within a context of length N requires O(M*N) operations, making long-context attribution prohibitively slow; and (2) faithfulness drop, where intermediate reasoning tokens absorb attribution mass, preventing importance from propagating back to the original input. To address these, we introduce FlashTrace, an efficient multi-token attribution method that employs span-wise aggregation to compute attribution over multi-token targets in a single pass, while maintaining faithfulness. Moreover, we design a recursive attribution mechanism that traces importance through intermediate reasoning chains back to source inputs. Extensive experiments on long-context retrieval (RULER) and multi-step reasoning (MATH, MorehopQA) tasks demonstrate that FlashTrace achieves over 130x speedup over existing baselines while maintaining superior faithfulness. We further analyze the dynamics of recursive attribution, showing that even a single recursive hop improves faithfulness by tracing importance through the reasoning chain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VLM-Guided Experience Replay</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01915</link><description>arXiv:2602.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled powerful semantic and multimodal reasoning capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance sample efficiency, high-level planning, and interpretability in reinforcement learning (RL). While prior work has integrated LLMs and VLMs into various components of RL, the replay buffer, a core component for storing and reusing experiences, remains unexplored. We propose addressing this gap by leveraging VLMs to guide the prioritization of experiences in the replay buffer. Our key idea is to use a frozen, pre-trained VLM (requiring no fine-tuning) as an automated evaluator to identify and prioritize promising sub-trajectories from the agent's experiences. Across scenarios, including game-playing and robotics, spanning both discrete and continuous domains, agents trained with our proposed prioritization method achieve 11-52% higher average success rates and improve sample efficiency by 19-45% compared to previous approaches. https://esharony.me/projects/vlm-rb/</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01915v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ForSim: Stepwise Forward Simulation for Traffic Policy Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01916</link><description>arXiv:2602.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the foundation of closed-loop training and evaluation in autonomous driving, traffic simulation still faces two fundamental challenges: covariate shift introduced by open-loop imitation learning and limited capacity to reflect the multimodal behaviors observed in real-world traffic. Although recent frameworks such as RIFT have partially addressed these issues through group-relative optimization, their forward simulation procedures remain largely non-reactive, leading to unrealistic agent interactions within the virtual domain and ultimately limiting simulation fidelity. To address these issues, we propose ForSim, a stepwise closed-loop forward simulation paradigm. At each virtual timestep, the traffic agent propagates the virtual candidate trajectory that best spatiotemporally matches the reference trajectory through physically grounded motion dynamics, thereby preserving multimodal behavioral diversity while ensuring intra-modality consistency. Other agents are updated with stepwise predictions, yielding coherent and interaction-aware evolution. When incorporated into the RIFT traffic simulation framework, ForSim operates in conjunction with group-relative optimization to fine-tune traffic policy. Extensive experiments confirm that this integration consistently improves safety while maintaining efficiency, realism, and comfort. These results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop multimodal interactions within forward simulation and enhance the fidelity and reliability of traffic simulation for autonomous driving.

GuideWeb formulates the task as producing page-level guidance by selecting \textbf{guide target elements} grounded in the webpage and generating concise guide text aligned with user intent. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation suite that jointly measures the accuracy of guide target element selection and the quality of generated intents and guide texts. Experiments show that our proposed \textbf{GuideWeb Agent} achieves \textbf{30.79\%} accuracy in guide target element prediction, while obtaining BLEU scores of \textbf{44.94} for intent generation and \textbf{21.34} for guide-text generation. Existing baselines perform substantially worse, which highlights that automatic guide generation remains challenging and that further advances are necessary before such systems can be reliably deployed in real-world settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01917v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Workout Buddies Are Virtual: AI Agents and Human Peers in a Longitudinal Physical Activity Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01918</link><description>arXiv:2602.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical inactivity remains a critical global health issue, yet scalable strategies for sustained motivation are scarce. Conversational agents designed as simulated exercising peers (SEPs) represent a promising alternative, but their long-term impact is unclear. We report a six-month randomized controlled trial (N=280) comparing individuals exercising alone, with a human peer, or with a large language model-driven SEP. Results revealed a partnership paradox: human peers evoked stronger social presence, while AI peers provided steadier encouragement and more reliable working alliances. Humans motivated through authentic comparison and accountability, whereas AI peers fostered consistent, low-stakes support. These complementary strengths suggest that AI agents should not mimic human authenticity but augment it with reliability. Our findings advance human-agent interaction research and point to hybrid designs where human presence and AI consistency jointly sustain physical activity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01918v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Code-Centric to Concept-Centric: Teaching NLP with LLM-Assisted "Vibe Coding"</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01919</link><description>arXiv:2602.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents both challenges and opportunities for Natural Language Processing (NLP) education. This paper introduces ``Vibe Coding,'' a pedagogical approach that leverages LLMs as coding assistants while maintaining focus on conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We describe the implementation of this approach in a senior-level undergraduate NLP course, where students completed seven labs using LLMs for code generation while being assessed primarily on conceptual understanding through critical reflection questions. Analysis of end-of-course feedback from 19 students reveals high satisfaction (mean scores 4.4-4.6/5.0) across engagement, conceptual learning, and assessment fairness. Students particularly valued the reduced cognitive load from debugging, enabling deeper focus on NLP concepts. However, challenges emerged around time constraints, LLM output verification, and the need for clearer task specifications. Our findings suggest that when properly structured with mandatory prompt logging and reflection-based assessment, LLM-assisted learning can shift focus from syntactic fluency to conceptual mastery, preparing students for an AI-augmented professional landscape.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01919v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PIMPC-GNN: Physics-Informed Multi-Phase Consensus Learning for Enhancing Imbalanced Node Classification in Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01920</link><description>arXiv:2602.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle in class-imbalanced settings, where minority classes are under-represented and predictions are biased toward majorities. We propose \textbf{PIMPC-GNN}, a physics-informed multi-phase consensus framework for imbalanced node classification. Our method integrates three complementary dynamics: (i) thermodynamic diffusion, which spreads minority labels to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) Kuramoto synchronisation, which aligns minority nodes through oscillatory consensus, and (iii) spectral embedding, which separates classes via structural regularisation. These perspectives are combined through class-adaptive ensemble weighting and trained with an imbalance-aware loss that couples balanced cross-entropy with physics-based constraints. Across five benchmark datasets and imbalance ratios from 5-100, PIMPC-GNN outperforms 16 state-of-the-art baselines, achieving notable gains in minority-class recall (up to +12.7\%) and balanced accuracy (up to +8.3\%). Beyond empirical improvements, the framework also provides interpretable insights into consensus dynamics in graph learning.

Abstract: Over the past years, embedding learning on networks has shown tremendous results in link prediction tasks for complex systems, with a wide range of real-life applications. Learning a representation for each node in a knowledge graph allows us to capture topological and semantic information, which can be processed in downstream analyses later. In the link prediction task, high-dimensional network information is encoded into low-dimensional vectors, which are then fed to a predictor to infer new connections between nodes in the network. As the network complexity (that is, the numbers of connections and types of interactions) grows, embedding learning turns out increasingly challenging. This review covers published models on embedding learning on multiplex networks for link prediction. First, we propose refined taxonomies to classify and compare models, depending on the type of embeddings and embedding techniques. Second, we review and address the problem of reproducible and fair evaluation of embedding learning on multiplex networks for the link prediction task. Finally, we tackle evaluation on directed multiplex networks by proposing a novel and fair testing procedure. This review constitutes a crucial step towards the development of more performant and tractable embedding learning approaches for multiplex networks and their fair evaluation for the link prediction task. We also suggest guidelines on the evaluation of models, and provide an informed perspective on the challenges and tools currently available to address downstream analyses applied to multiplex networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01922v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Integration of Nonlinear Incomplete Clinical Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01924</link><description>arXiv:2602.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal clinical data are characterized by high dimensionality, heterogeneous representations, and structured missingness, posing significant challenges for predictive modeling, data integration, and interpretability. We propose BIONIC (Bayesian Integration of Nonlinear Incomplete Clinical data), a unified probabilistic framework that integrates heterogeneous multimodal data under missingness through a joint generative-discriminative latent architecture. BIONIC uses pretrained embeddings for complex modalities such as medical images and clinical text, while incorporating structured clinical variables directly within a Bayesian multimodal formulation. The proposed framework enables robust learning in partially observed and semi-supervised settings by explicitly modeling modality-level and variable-level missingness, as well as missing labels. We evaluate BIONIC on three multimodal clinical and biomedical datasets, demonstrating strong and consistent discriminative performance compared to representative multimodal baselines, particularly under incomplete data scenarios. Beyond predictive accuracy, BIONIC provides intrinsic interpretability through its latent structure, enabling population-level analysis of modality relevance and supporting clinically meaningful insight.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01924v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LIEREx: Language-Image Embeddings for Robotic Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01930</link><description>arXiv:2602.01930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic maps allow a robot to reason about its surroundings to fulfill tasks such as navigating known environments, finding specific objects, and exploring unmapped areas. Traditional mapping approaches provide accurate geometric representations but are often constrained by pre-designed symbolic vocabularies. The reliance on fixed object classes makes it impractical to handle out-of-distribution knowledge not defined at design time. Recent advances in Vision-Language Foundation Models, such as CLIP, enable open-set mapping, where objects are encoded as high-dimensional embeddings rather than fixed labels. In LIEREx, we integrate these VLFMs with established 3D Semantic Scene Graphs to enable target-directed exploration by an autonomous agent in partially unknown environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01930v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Things that Matter -- Identifying Interactions and IoT Device Types in Encrypted Matter Traffic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01932</link><description>arXiv:2602.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter is the most recent application-layer standard for the Internet of Things (IoT). As one of its major selling points, Matter's design imposes particular attention to security and privacy: it provides validated secure session establishment protocols, and it uses robust security algorithms to secure communications between IoT devices and Matter controllers. However, to our knowledge, there is no systematic analysis investigating the extent to which a passive attacker, in possession of lower layer keys or exploiting security misconfiguration at those layers, could infer information by passively analyzing encrypted Matter traffic. In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing the robustness of the Matter IoT standard to encrypted traffic analysis performed by a passive eavesdropper. By using various datasets collected from real-world testbeds and simulated setups, we identify patterns in metadata of the encrypted Matter traffic that allow inferring the specific interactions occurring between end devices and controllers. Moreover, we associate patterns in sequences of interactions to specific types of IoT devices. These patterns can be used to create fingerprints that allow a passive attacker to infer the type of devices used in the network, constituting a serious breach of users privacy. Our results reveal that we can identify specific Matter interactions that occur in encrypted traffic with over $95\%$ accuracy also in the presence of packet losses and delays. Moreover, we can identify Matter device types with a minimum accuracy of $88\%$. The CSA acknowledged our findings, and expressed the willingness to address such vulnerabilities in the next releases of the standard.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Model and Formal Concept Analysis: a comparative study for Topic Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01933</link><description>arXiv:2602.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic modeling is a research field finding increasing applications: historically from document retrieving, to sentiment analysis and text summarization. Large Language Models (LLM) are currently a major trend in text processing, but few works study their usefulness for this task. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) has recently been presented as a candidate for topic modeling, but no real applied case study has been conducted. In this work, we compare LLM and FCA to better understand their strengths and weakneses in the topic modeling field. FCA is evaluated through the CREA pipeline used in past experiments on topic modeling and visualization, whereas GPT-5 is used for the LLM. A strategy based on three prompts is applied with GPT-5 in a zero-shot setup: topic generation from document batches, merging of batch results into final topics, and topic labeling. A first experiment reuses the teaching materials previously used to evaluate CREA, while a second experiment analyzes 40 research articles in information systems to compare the extracted topics with the underling subfields.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] COLT: Lightweight Multi-LLM Collaboration through Shared MCTS Reasoning for Model Compilation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01935</link><description>arXiv:2602.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model serving costs dominate AI systems, making compiler optimization essential for scalable deployment. Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01935v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PIMCST: Physics-Informed Multi-Phase Consensus and Spatio-Temporal Few-Shot Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01936</link><description>arXiv:2602.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate traffic flow prediction remains a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in cross-domain, data-scarce scenarios where limited historical data hinders model training and generalisation. The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making across many real-world applications. Unlike data in vision and language domains, time series data is inherently tied to the evolution of underlying processes and can only accumulate as real-world time progresses, limiting the effectiveness of scale-driven pretraining alone. This time-bound constraint poses a challenge for enabling large language models (LLMs) to acquire forecasting capability, as existing approaches primarily rely on representation-level alignment or inference-time temporal modules rather than explicitly teaching forecasting behavior to the LLM. We propose T-LLM, a temporal distillation framework that equips general-purpose LLMs with time series forecasting capability by transferring predictive behavior from a lightweight temporal teacher during training. The teacher combines trend modeling and frequency-domain analysis to provide structured temporal supervision, and is removed entirely at inference, leaving the LLM as the sole forecasting model. Experiments on benchmark datasets and infectious disease forecasting tasks demonstrate that T-LLM consistently outperforms existing LLM-based forecasting methods under full-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while enabling a simple and efficient deployment pipeline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01937v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Flux-Correction Form of the Third-Order Edge-Based Scheme for a General Numerical Flux Function</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01938</link><description>arXiv:2602.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a flux-correction form of the third-order edge-based scheme for the Euler equations that enables the direct use of a general flux function. The core idea is to replace, without loss of accuracy, the arithmetic average of the flux extrapolations by a general numerical flux evaluated at the edge midpoint, together with a correction term. We show that the proposed flux-correction form preserves third-order accuracy, provided that the general numerical flux is evaluated with the left and right states that are computed exactly for a quadratic function, which can be achieved effectively by the U-MUSCL scheme with {\kappa} = 1/2. Numerical results are presented to verify third-order accuracy with the HLLC and LDFSS flux functions on irregular tetrahedral grids.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Exploratory and Focused Manipulation with Bimanual Active Perception: A New Problem, Benchmark and Strategy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01939</link><description>arXiv:2602.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, active vision has reemerged as an important concept for manipulation, since visual occlusion occurs more frequently when main cameras are mounted on the robot heads. We reflect on the visual occlusion issue and identify its essence as the absence of information useful for task completion. Inspired by this, we come up with the more fundamental problem of Exploratory and Focused Manipulation (EFM). The proposed problem is about actively collecting information to complete challenging manipulation tasks that require exploration or focus. As an initial attempt to address this problem, we establish the EFM-10 benchmark that consists of 4 categories of tasks that align with our definition (10 tasks in total). We further come up with a Bimanual Active Perception (BAP) strategy, which leverages one arm to provide active vision and another arm to provide force sensing while manipulating. Based on this idea, we collect a dataset named BAPData for the tasks in EFM-10. With the dataset, we successfully verify the effectiveness of the BAP strategy in an imitation learning manner. We hope that the EFM-10 benchmark along with the BAP strategy can become a cornerstone that facilitates future research towards this direction.

Abstract: AI is moving from domain-specific autonomy in closed, predictable settings to large-language-model-driven agents that plan and act in open, cross-organizational environments. As a result, the cybersecurity risk landscape is changing in fundamental ways. Agentic AI systems can plan, act, collaborate, and persist over time, functioning as participants in complex socio-technical ecosystems rather than as isolated software components. Although recent work has strengthened defenses against model and pipeline level vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, data poisoning, and tool misuse, these system centric approaches may fail to capture risks that arise from autonomy, interaction, and emergent behavior. This article introduces the 4C Framework for multi-agent AI security, inspired by societal governance. It organizes agentic risks across four interdependent dimensions: Core (system, infrastructure, and environmental integrity), Connection (communication, coordination, and trust), Cognition (belief, goal, and reasoning integrity), and Compliance (ethical, legal, and institutional governance). By shifting AI security from a narrow focus on system-centric protection to the broader preservation of behavioral integrity and intent, the framework complements existing AI security strategies and offers a principled foundation for building agentic AI systems that are trustworthy, governable, and aligned with human values.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boundary-Constrained Diffusion Models for Floorplan Generation: Balancing Realism and Diversity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01949</link><description>arXiv:2602.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become widely popular for automated floorplan generation, producing highly realistic layouts conditioned on user-defined constraints. However, optimizing for perceptual metrics such as the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) causes limited design diversity. To address this, we propose the Diversity Score (DS), a metric that quantifies layout diversity under fixed constraints. Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity. Out-Of-Distribution evaluations further demonstrate the models' reliance on dataset priors, emphasizing the need for generative systems that explicitly balance fidelity, diversity, and generalization in architectural design tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01949v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SQLAgent: Learning to Explore Before Generating as a Data Engineer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01952</link><description>arXiv:2602.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have recently shown impressive capabilities in reasoning and code generation, making them promising tools for natural language interfaces to relational databases. However, existing approaches often fail to generalize in complex, real-world settings due to the highly database-specific nature of SQL reasoning, which requires deep familiarity with unique schemas, ambiguous semantics, and intricate join paths. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel two-stage LLM-based framework that decouples knowledge acquisition from query generation. In the Exploration Stage, the system autonomously constructs a database-specific knowledge base by navigating the schema with a Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired strategy, generating triplets of schema fragments, executable queries, and natural language descriptions as usage examples. In the Deployment Stage, a dual-agent system leverages the collected knowledge as in-context examples to iteratively retrieve relevant information and generate accurate SQL queries in response to user questions. This design enables the agent to proactively familiarize itself with unseen databases and handle complex, multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy over strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01952v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Multivariate Models with Parametric Conditionals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01953</link><description>arXiv:2602.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider deep multivariate models for heterogeneous collections of random variables. In the context of computer vision, such collections may e.g. consist of images, segmentations, image attributes, and latent variables. When developing such models, most existing works start from an application task and design the model components and their dependencies to meet the needs of the chosen task. This has the disadvantage of limiting the applicability of the resulting model for other downstream tasks. Here, instead, we propose to represent the joint probability distribution by means of conditional probability distributions for each group of variables conditioned on the rest. Such models can then be used for practically any possible downstream task. Their learning can be approached as training a parametrised Markov chain kernel by maximising the data likelihood of its limiting distribution. This has the additional advantage of allowing a wide range of semi-supervised learning scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01953v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Open Vocabulary: Multimodal Prompting for Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01954</link><description>arXiv:2602.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection in remote sensing commonly relies on text-only prompting to specify target categories, implicitly assuming that inference-time category queries can be reliably grounded through pretraining-induced text-visual alignment. In practice, this assumption often breaks down in remote sensing scenarios due to task- and application-specific category semantics, resulting in unstable category specification under open-vocabulary settings. To address this limitation, we propose RS-MPOD, a multimodal open-vocabulary detection framework that reformulates category specification beyond text-only prompting by incorporating instance-grounded visual prompts, textual prompts, and their multimodal integration. RS-MPOD introduces a visual prompt encoder to extract appearance-based category cues from exemplar instances, enabling text-free category specification, and a multimodal fusion module to integrate visual and textual information when both modalities are available. Extensive experiments on standard, cross-dataset, and fine-grained remote sensing benchmarks show that visual prompting yields more reliable category specification under semantic ambiguity and distribution shifts, while multimodal prompting provides a flexible alternative that remains competitive when textual semantics are well aligned.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01954v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Models via Knowledge Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01956</link><description>arXiv:2602.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for mitigating hallucinations and enabling risk-aware deployment in safety-critical tasks. However, estimating Epistemic Uncertainty(EU) via Deep Ensembles is computationally prohibitive at the scale of modern models. We propose a framework that leverages the small draft models to efficiently estimate token-level EU, bypassing the need for full-scale ensembling. Theoretically grounded in a Bias-Variance Decomposition, our approach approximates EU via Jensen-Shannon divergence among drafts (variance proxy) and KL divergence between the draft mixture and the target (bias proxy). To further ensure accuracy without significant overhead, we introduce Online Stochastic Distillation (OSD) to efficiently approximate target aggregation and the Data-Diverse Drafts (DDD) strategy to enhance draft diversity for better target approximation. Extensive experiments on GSM8K demonstrate that our method reduces the estimation error (RMSE) by up to 37% compared to baselines. Crucially, our approach achieves Hallucination Detection performance competitive with heavy perturbation-based methods like TokUR while incurring negligible inference costs, offering a practical solution for uncertainty-aware LLM deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01956v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Role of CI Adoption in Mobile App Success: An Empirical Study of Open-Source Android Projects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01957</link><description>arXiv:2602.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile apps face strong pressure for fast and reliable updates. Continuous Integration (CI) helps automate builds, tests, and releases, but its impact on mobile development remains underexplored. Despite the widespread use of CI, little is known about how it affects development activity, release speed, and user-facing outcomes in mobile projects. Existing studies mostly focus on CI adoption in general-purpose software, providing limited insight into mobile-specific dynamics, such as app store visibility and user engagement. In this paper, we analyze open-source Android apps to (1) compare CI adopters and non-adopters, (2) characterize adoption patterns using activity and bug metrics, and (3) assess pre/post adoption changes and user-facing outcomes. We observe that CI adopters are larger and more active, with faster and more regular releases. CI adoption is concentrated in integration- and reliability-intensive categories (e.g., finance and productivity) and is associated with higher Google Play Store engagement (more downloads and reviews) without lower ratings. Overall, CI adoption aligns with practices that support sustained delivery, higher project visibility, and stronger user engagement in mobile ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01957v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boosting metacognition in entangled human-AI interaction to navigate cognitive-behavioral drift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01959</link><description>arXiv:2602.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People navigate complex environments using cues, heuristics, and other strategies, which are often adaptive in stable settings. However, as AI increasingly permeates society's information environments, those become more adaptive and evolving: LLM-based chatbots participate in extended interaction, maintain conversational histories, mirror social cues, and can hypercustomize responses, thereby shaping not only what information is accessed but how questions are framed, how evidence is interpreted, and when action feels warranted. Here we propose a framework for sustained human-AI interaction that rests on invariant features of human cognition and human--AI interaction and centers on three interlinked phenomena: entanglement between users and AI systems, the emergence of cognitive and behavioral drift over repeated interactions, and the role of metacognition in the awareness and regulation of these dynamics. As conversational agents provide cues (e.g., fluency, coherence, responsiveness) that people treat as informative, subjective confidence and action readiness may increase without corresponding gains in epistemic reliability, making drift difficult to detect and correct. We describe these dynamics across micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. The framework identifies four metacognitive intervention points and psychologically informed interventions that provide metacognitive scaffolding (boosting and self-nudging). Finally, we outline a long-horizon research agenda for scientific foresight.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grounding Generated Videos in Feasible Plans via World Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01960</link><description>arXiv:2602.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale video generative models have shown emerging capabilities as zero-shot visual planners, yet video-generated plans often violate temporal consistency and physical constraints, leading to failures when mapped to executable actions. To address this, we propose Grounding Video Plans with World Models (GVP-WM), a planning method that grounds video-generated plans into feasible action sequences using a learned action-conditioned world model. At test-time, GVP-WM first generates a video plan from initial and goal observations, then projects the video guidance onto the manifold of dynamically feasible latent trajectories via video-guided latent collocation. In particular, we formulate grounding as a goal-conditioned latent-space trajectory optimization problem that jointly optimizes latent states and actions under world-model dynamics, while preserving semantic alignment with the video-generated plan. Empirically, GVP-WM recovers feasible long-horizon plans from zero-shot image-to-video-generated and motion-blurred videos that violate physical constraints, across navigation and manipulation simulation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01960v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-Shot Off-Policy Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01962</link><description>arXiv:2602.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-policy learning methods seek to derive an optimal policy directly from a fixed dataset of prior interactions. This objective presents significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent distributional shift and value function overestimation bias. These issues become even more noticeable in zero-shot reinforcement learning, where an agent trained on reward-free data must adapt to new tasks at test time without additional training. In this work, we address the off-policy problem in a zero-shot setting by discovering a theoretical connection of successor measures to stationary density ratios. Using this insight, our algorithm can infer optimal importance sampling ratios, effectively performing a stationary distribution correction with an optimal policy for any task on the fly. We benchmark our method in motion tracking tasks on SMPL Humanoid, continuous control on ExoRL, and for the long-horizon OGBench tasks. Our technique seamlessly integrates into forward-backward representation frameworks and enables fast-adaptation to new tasks in a training-free regime. More broadly, this work bridges off-policy learning and zero-shot adaptation, offering benefits to both research areas.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01962v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking the Static Graph: Context-Aware Traversal for Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01965</link><description>arXiv:2602.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shifted from simple vector similarity to structure-aware approaches like HippoRAG, which leverage Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture multi-hop dependencies. However, these methods suffer from a "Static Graph Fallacy": they rely on fixed transition probabilities determined during indexing. This rigidity ignores the query-dependent nature of edge relevance, causing semantic drift where random walks are diverted into high-degree "hub" nodes before reaching critical downstream evidence. Consequently, models often achieve high partial recall but fail to retrieve the complete evidence chain required for multi-hop queries. To address this, we propose CatRAG, Context-Aware Traversal for robust RAG, a framework that builds on the HippoRAG 2 architecture and transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. We introduce a multi-faceted framework to steer the random walk: (1) Symbolic Anchoring, which injects weak entity constraints to regularize the random walk; (2) Query-Aware Dynamic Edge Weighting, which dynamically modulates graph structure, to prune irrelevant paths while amplifying those aligned with the query's intent; and (3) Key-Fact Passage Weight Enhancement, a cost-efficient bias that structurally anchors the random walk to likely evidence. Experiments across four multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that CatRAG consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our analysis reveals that while standard Recall metrics show modest gains, CatRAG achieves substantial improvements in reasoning completeness, the capacity to recover the entire evidence path without gaps. These results reveal that our approach effectively bridges the gap between retrieving partial context and enabling fully grounded reasoning.

Abstract: While large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive problem-solving capabilities, they typically operate as static systems, lacking the ability to evolve through lifelong interaction. Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters. This enables the agent to internalize extensive historical experience directly into its latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method in long-term agent evolution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mixture-of-Experts with Intermediate CTC Supervision for Accented Speech Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01967</link><description>arXiv:2602.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accented speech remains a persistent challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR), as most models are trained on data dominated by a few high-resource English varieties, leading to substantial performance degradation for other accents. Accent-agnostic approaches improve robustness yet struggle with heavily accented or unseen varieties, while accent-specific methods rely on limited and often noisy labels. We introduce Moe-Ctc, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with intermediate CTC supervision that jointly promotes expert specialization and generalization. During training, accent-aware routing encourages experts to capture accent-specific patterns, which gradually transitions to label-free routing for inference. Each expert is equipped with its own CTC head to align routing with transcription quality, and a routing-augmented loss further stabilizes optimization. Experiments on the Mcv-Accent benchmark demonstrate consistent gains across both seen and unseen accents in low- and high-resource conditions, achieving up to 29.3% relative WER reduction over strong FastConformer baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01967v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition for Structure-Aware Table Understanding with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01969</link><description>arXiv:2602.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex tables with multi-level headers, merged cells and heterogeneous layouts pose persistent challenges for LLMs in both understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches typically rely on table linearization or normalized grid modeling. However, these representations struggle to explicitly capture hierarchical structures and cross-dimensional dependencies, which can lead to misalignment between structural semantics and textual representations for non-standard tables. To address this issue, we propose an Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition (OHD) framework that constructs structure-preserving input representations of complex tables for LLMs. OHD introduces an Orthogonal Tree Induction (OTI) method based on spatial--semantic co-constraints, which decomposes irregular tables into a column tree and a row tree to capture vertical and horizontal hierarchical dependencies, respectively. Building on this representation, we design a dual-pathway association protocol to symmetrically reconstruct semantic lineage of each cell, and incorporate an LLM as a semantic arbitrator to align multi-level semantic information. We evaluate OHD framework on two complex table question answering benchmarks, AITQA and HiTab. Experimental results show that OHD consistently outperforms existing representation paradigms across multiple evaluation metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Small Generalizable Prompt Predictive Models Can Steer Efficient RL Post-Training of Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01970</link><description>arXiv:2602.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models but often involves high computational costs due to rollout-intensive optimization. Online prompt selection presents a plausible solution by prioritizing informative prompts to improve training efficiency. However, current methods either depend on costly, exact evaluations or construct prompt-specific predictive models lacking generalization across prompts. This study introduces Generalizable Predictive Prompt Selection (GPS), which performs Bayesian inference towards prompt difficulty using a lightweight generative model trained on the shared optimization history. Intermediate-difficulty prioritization and history-anchored diversity are incorporated into the batch acquisition principle to select informative prompt batches. The small predictive model also generalizes at test-time for efficient computational allocation. Experiments across varied reasoning benchmarks indicate GPS's substantial improvements in training efficiency, final performance, and test-time efficiency over superior baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Your AI-Generated Image Detector Can Secretly Achieve SOTA Accuracy, If Calibrated</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01973</link><description>arXiv:2602.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being trained on balanced datasets, existing AI-generated image detectors often exhibit systematic bias at test time, frequently misclassifying fake images as real. We hypothesize that this behavior stems from distributional shift in fake samples and implicit priors learned during training. Specifically, models tend to overfit to superficial artifacts that do not generalize well across different generation methods, leading to a misaligned decision threshold when faced with test-time distribution shift. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded post-hoc calibration framework based on Bayesian decision theory. In particular, we introduce a learnable scalar correction to the model's logits, optimized on a small validation set from the target distribution while keeping the backbone frozen. This parametric adjustment compensates for distributional shift in model output, realigning the decision boundary even without requiring ground-truth labels. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves robustness without retraining, offering a lightweight and principled solution for reliable and adaptive AI-generated image detection in the open world.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but face deployment challenges due to their massive size. Structured pruning offers acceleration benefits but leads to significant performance degradation. Recent PCA-based pruning methods have alleviated this issue by retaining key activation components, but are only applied between modules in order to fuse the transformation matrix, which introduces extra parameters and severely disrupts activation distributions due to residual connections. To address these issues, we propose IntraSlice, a framework that applies block-wise module-intra PCA compression pruning. By leveraging the structural characteristics of Transformer modules, we design an approximate PCA method whose transformation matrices can be fully fused into the model without additional parameters. We also introduce a PCA-based global pruning ratio estimator that further considers the distribution of compressed activations, building on conventional module importance. We validate our method on Llama2, Llama3, and Phi series across various language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior compression performance compared to recent baselines at the same compression ratio or inference speed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01975v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlyPrompt: Brain-Inspired Random-Expanded Routing with Temporal-Ensemble Experts for General Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01976</link><description>arXiv:2602.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General continual learning (GCL) challenges intelligent systems to learn from single-pass, non-stationary data streams without clear task boundaries. While recent advances in continual parameter-efficient tuning (PET) of pretrained models show promise, they typically rely on multiple training epochs and explicit task cues, limiting their effectiveness in GCL scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often lack targeted design and fail to address two fundamental challenges in continual PET: how to allocate expert parameters to evolving data distributions, and how to improve their representational capacity under limited supervision. Inspired by the fruit fly's hierarchical memory system characterized by sparse expansion and modular ensembles, we propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework that decomposes GCL into two subproblems: expert routing and expert competence improvement. FlyPrompt introduces a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads to dynamically adapt decision boundaries over time. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate FlyPrompt's superior performance, achieving up to 11.23%, 12.43%, and 7.62% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200, respectively.

Abstract: Knowledge editing methods for large language models are commonly evaluated using predefined benchmarks that assess edited facts together with a limited set of related or neighboring knowledge. While effective, such evaluations remain confined to finite, dataset-bounded samples, leaving the broader impact of editing on the model's knowledge system insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we introduce Embedding-Virtualized Knowledge (EVK) that characterizes model knowledge through controlled perturbations in embedding space, enabling the exploration of a substantially broader and virtualized knowledge region beyond explicit data annotations. Based on EVK, we construct an embedding-level evaluation benchmark EVK-Bench that quantifies potential knowledge drift induced by editing, revealing effects that are not captured by conventional sample-based metrics. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play EVK-Align module that constrains embedding-level knowledge drift during editing and can be seamlessly integrated into existing editing methods. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enables more comprehensive evaluation while significantly improving knowledge preservation without sacrificing editing accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01977v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpikingGamma: Surrogate-Gradient Free and Temporally Precise Online Training of Spiking Neural Networks with Smoothed Delays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01978</link><description>arXiv:2602.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic hardware implementations of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, low-latency AI through sparse, event-driven computation. Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01978v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hacking Flow: From Lived Practices to Innovation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01979</link><description>arXiv:2602.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In digital knowledge work, flow promises not just productivity; it offers a pathway to well-being. Yet despite decades of flow research in HCI, we know little about how to design digital interventions that support it. In this work, we foreground lived interventions - everyday practices workers already use to foster flow - to uncover overlooked opportunities and chart new directions for digital intervention design. Specifically, we report findings from two studies: (1) a reflexive thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses (n = 160), surfacing 38 lived interventions across four categories: environment, organization, task shaping, and personal readiness; and (2) a quantitative online survey (n = 121) that validates this repertoire, identifies which interventions are broadly endorsed versus polarizing, and elicits visions of technological support. We contribute empirical insights into how digital workers cultivate flow, situate these lived interventions within existing literature, and derive design opportunities for future digital flow interventions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01979v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] S3-CoT: Self-Sampled Succinct Reasoning Enables Efficient Chain-of-Thought LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01982</link><description>arXiv:2602.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) equipped with chain-of-thought (CoT) achieve strong performance and offer a window into LLM behavior. However, recent evidence suggests that improvements in CoT capabilities often come with redundant reasoning processes, motivating a key question: Can LLMs acquire a fast-thinking mode analogous to human System 1 reasoning? To explore this, our study presents a self-sampling framework based on activation steering for efficient CoT learning. Our method can induce style-aligned and variable-length reasoning traces from target LLMs themselves without any teacher guidance, thereby alleviating a central bottleneck of SFT-based methods-the scarcity of high-quality supervision data. Using filtered data by gold answers, we perform SFT for efficient CoT learning with (i) a human-like dual-cognitive system, and (ii) a progressive compression curriculum. Furthermore, we explore a self-evolution regime in which SFT is driven solely by prediction-consistent data of variable-length variants, eliminating the need for gold answers. Extensive experiments on math benchmarks, together with cross-domain generalization tests in medicine, show that our method yields stable improvements for both general and R1-style LLMs. Our data and model checkpoints can be found at https://github.com/DYR1/S3-CoT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01982v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evolving from Tool User to Creator via Training-Free Experience Reuse in Multimodal Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01983</link><description>arXiv:2602.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) models have effectively extended the question-answering capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external tools. However, real-world scenarios present numerous open-ended problems where fixed tools often fail to meet task requirements. Furthermore, the lack of self-optimization mechanisms means that erroneous tool outputs can mislead the LLM's responses. Additionally, the construction of existing tools entails significant manual effort, which consequently constrains their applicability. Recognizing that the reasoning traces of LLMs encapsulate implicit problem-solving capabilities, we propose UCT, a novel training-free framework that transforms agents from tool users to tool creators. This approach harvests reasoning experiences and distills them into reusable assets. This method transforms the agent from a mere tool user into a tool creator, enabling adaptive tool creation and self-updating during the inference process. We also introduce a memory consolidation mechanism to maintain the tool library, ensuring high reusability of retained experiential memory for subsequent reasoning tasks. This novel automated tool construction paradigm continuously improves tool quality during reasoning, allowing the overall agent system to progress without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a novel paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of TIR models. In particular, the significant performance gains achieved +20.86%$\uparrow$ and +23.04%$\uparrow$ on benchmarks across multi-domain mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks validate the self-evolving capability of the agent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01983v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Multi-Image Understanding through Delimiter Token Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01984</link><description>arXiv:2602.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on single-image tasks, but their performance declines when multiple images are provided as input. One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10. Notably, our method requires no additional training or inference cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01984v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Belief Updating and Delegation in Multi-Task Human-AI Interaction: Evidence from Controlled Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01986</link><description>arXiv:2602.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support heterogeneous tasks within a single interface, requiring users to form, update, and act upon beliefs about one system across domains with different reliability profiles. Understanding how such beliefs transfer across tasks and shape delegation is therefore critical for the design of multipurpose AI systems. We report a preregistered experiment (N=240; 7,200 trials) in which participants interacted with a controlled AI simulation across grammar checking, travel planning, and visual question answering, each with fixed, domain-typical accuracy levels. Delegation was operationalized as a binary reliance decision: accepting the AI's output versus acting independently, and belief dynamics were evaluated against Bayesian benchmarks. We find three main results. First, participants do not reset beliefs between tasks: priors in a new task depend on posteriors from the previous task, with a 10-point increase predicting a 3-4 point higher subsequent prior. Second, within tasks, belief updating follows the Bayesian direction but is substantially conservative, proceeding at roughly half the normative Bayesian rate. Third, delegation is driven primarily by subjective beliefs about AI accuracy rather than self-confidence, though confidence independently reduces reliance when beliefs are held constant. Together, these findings show that users form global, path-dependent expectations about multipurpose AI systems, update them conservatively, and rely on AI primarily based on subjective beliefs rather than objective performance. We discuss implications for expectation calibration, reliance design, and the risks of belief spillovers in deployed LLM-based interfaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAME: Stabilized Mixture-of-Experts for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01990</link><description>arXiv:2602.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance through instruction tuning, but real-world deployment requires them to continually expand their capabilities, making Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) essential. Recent methods leverage sparse expert routing to promote task specialization, but we find that the expert routing process suffers from drift as the data distribution evolves. For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions. To mitigate expert drift, we regulate expert updates via curvature-aware scaling using historical input covariance in a rehearsal-free manner. SAME also introduces adaptive expert activation to freeze selected experts during training, reducing redundant computation and cross-task interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate its SOTA performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01990v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Latent Vector Prediction for Localized Control in Image Generation via Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01991</link><description>arXiv:2602.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models emerged as a leading approach in text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, attempting to achieve detailed control to get a desired image solely through text remains a laborious trial-and-error endeavor. Recent methods have introduced image-level controls alongside with text prompts, using prior images to extract conditional information such as edges, segmentation and depth maps. While effective, these methods apply conditions uniformly across the entire image, limiting localized control. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enable precise local control over user-defined regions of an image, while leaving to the diffusion model the task of autonomously generating the remaining areas according to the original prompt. Our approach introduces a new training framework that incorporates masking features and an additional loss term, which leverages the prediction of the initial latent vector at any diffusion step to enhance the correspondence between the current step and the final sample in the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively synthesizes high-quality images with controlled local conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emergent Analogical Reasoning in Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01992</link><description>arXiv:2602.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogy is a central faculty of human intelligence, enabling abstract patterns discovered in one domain to be applied to another. Despite its central role in cognition, the mechanisms by which Transformers acquire and implement analogical reasoning remain poorly understood. In this work, inspired by the notion of functors in category theory, we formalize analogical reasoning as the inference of correspondences between entities across categories. Based on this formulation, we introduce synthetic tasks that evaluate the emergence of analogical reasoning under controlled settings. We find that the emergence of analogical reasoning is highly sensitive to data characteristics, optimization choices, and model scale. Through mechanistic analysis, we show that analogical reasoning in Transformers decomposes into two key components: (1) geometric alignment of relational structure in the embedding space, and (2) the application of a functor within the Transformer. These mechanisms enable models to transfer relational structure from one category to another, realizing analogy. Finally, we quantify these effects and find that the same trends are observed in pretrained LLMs. In doing so, we move analogy from an abstract cognitive notion to a concrete, mechanistically grounded phenomenon in modern neural networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01992v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thinking Like a Doctor: Conversational Diagnosis through the Exploration of Diagnostic Knowledge Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01995</link><description>arXiv:2602.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational diagnosis requires multi-turn history-taking, where an agent asks clarifying questions to refine differential diagnoses under incomplete information. Existing approaches often rely on the parametric knowledge of a model or assume that patients provide rich and concrete information, which is unrealistic. To address these limitations, we propose a conversational diagnosis system that explores a diagnostic knowledge graph to reason in two steps: (i) generating diagnostic hypotheses from the dialogue context, and (ii) verifying hypotheses through clarifying questions, which are repeated until a final diagnosis is reached. Since evaluating the system requires a realistic patient simulator that responds to the system's questions, we adopt a well-established simulator along with patient profiles from MIMIC-IV. We further adapt it to describe symptoms vaguely to reflect real-world patients during early clinical encounters. Experiments show improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines, and evaluations by physicians support the realism of our simulator and the clinical utility of the generated questions. Our code will be released upon publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01995v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimizing Tensor Train Decomposition in DNNs for RISC-V Architectures Using Design Space Exploration and Compiler Optimizations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01996</link><description>arXiv:2602.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become indispensable in many real-life applications like natural language processing, and autonomous systems. However, deploying DNNs on resource-constrained devices, e.g., in RISC-V platforms, remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of fully connected (FC) layers, which dominate resource consumption. Low-rank factorization (LRF) offers an effective approach to compressing FC layers, but the vast design space of LRF solutions involves complex trade-offs among FLOPs, memory size, inference time, and accuracy, making the LRF process complex and time-consuming. This paper introduces an end-to-end LRF design space exploration methodology and a specialized design tool for optimizing FC layers on RISC-V processors. Using Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offered by TensorFlow T3F library, the proposed work prunes the LRF design space by excluding first, inefficient decomposition shapes and second, solutions with poor inference performance on RISC-V architectures. Compiler optimizations are then applied to enhance custom T3F layer performance, minimizing inference time and boosting computational efficiency. On average, our TT-decomposed layers run 3x faster than IREE and 8x faster than Pluto on the same compressed model. This work provides an efficient solution for deploying DNNs on edge and embedded devices powered by RISC-V architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01996v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Limits of Layer Pruning for Generative Reasoning in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01997</link><description>arXiv:2602.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that layer pruning can compress large language models (LLMs) while retaining strong performance on classification benchmarks with little or no finetuning. However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through a systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques. Crucially, despite these gains, recovery for generative reasoning remains fundamentally limited relative to classification tasks and is viable primarily at lower pruning ratios. Overall, we characterize the practical limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and provide guidance on when depth reduction can be applied effectively under constrained post-training regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01997v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Latent Signals to Reflection Behavior: Tracing Meta-Cognitive Activation Trajectory in R1-Style LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01999</link><description>arXiv:2602.01999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R1-style LLMs have attracted growing attention for their capacity for self-reflection, yet the internal mechanisms underlying such behavior remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we anchor on the onset of reflection behavior and trace its layer-wise activation trajectory. Using the logit lens to read out token-level semantics, we uncover a structured progression: (i) Latent-control layers, where an approximate linear direction encodes the semantics of thinking budget; (ii) Semantic-pivot layers, where discourse-level cues, including turning-point and summarization cues, surface and dominate the probability mass; and (iii) Behavior-overt layers, where the likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens begins to rise until they become highly likely to be sampled. Moreover, our targeted interventions uncover a causal chain across these stages: prompt-level semantics modulate the projection of activations along latent-control directions, thereby inducing competition between turning-point and summarization cues in semantic-pivot layers, which in turn regulates the sampling likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens in behavior-overt layers. Collectively, our findings suggest a human-like meta-cognitive process-progressing from latent monitoring, to discourse-level regulation, and to finally overt self-reflection.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse images remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of recovering accurate geometry and texture without optimization. Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive. However, they often fail to produce continuous surfaces and instead yield discrete, color-biased point clouds that appear plausible at normal resolution but reveal severe artifacts under close-up views. To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

Abstract: Quantization Error Reconstruction (QER) reduces accuracy loss in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) by approximating weights as $\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$, using a rank-$r$ correction to reconstruct quantization error. Prior methods devote the full rank budget to error reconstruction, which is suboptimal when $\mathbf{W}$ has intrinsic low-rank structure and quantization corrupts dominant directions. We propose Structured Residual Reconstruction (SRR), a rank-allocation framework that preserves the top-$k$ singular subspace of the activation-scaled weight before quantization, quantizes only the residual, and uses the remaining rank $r-k$ for error reconstruction. We derive a theory-guided criterion for selecting $k$ by balancing quantization-exposed energy and unrecoverable error under rank constraints. We further show that resulting $\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$ parameterization naturally supports Quantized Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (QPEFT), and stabilizes fine-tuning via gradient scaling along preserved directions. Experiments demonstrate consistent perplexity reductions across diverse models and quantization settings in PTQ, along with a 5.9 percentage-point average gain on GLUE under 2-bit QPEFT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniDriveDreamer: A Single-Stage Multimodal World Model for Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02002</link><description>arXiv:2602.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World models have demonstrated significant promise for data synthesis in autonomous driving. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on single-modality generation, typically focusing on either multi-camera video or LiDAR sequence synthesis. In this paper, we propose UniDriveDreamer, a single-stage unified multimodal world model for autonomous driving, which directly generates multimodal future observations without relying on intermediate representations or cascaded modules. Our framework introduces a LiDAR-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to encode input LiDAR sequences, alongside a video VAE for multi-camera images. To ensure cross-modal compatibility and training stability, we propose Unified Latent Anchoring (ULA), which explicitly aligns the latent distributions of the two modalities. The aligned features are fused and processed by a diffusion transformer that jointly models their geometric correspondence and temporal evolution. Additionally, structured scene layout information is projected per modality as a conditioning signal to guide the synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniDriveDreamer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both video and LiDAR generation, while also yielding measurable improvements in downstream</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ClueTracer: Question-to-Vision Clue Tracing for Training-Free Hallucination Suppression in Multimodal Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02004</link><description>arXiv:2602.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models solve challenging visual problems via explicit long-chain inference: they gather visual clues from images and decode clues into textual tokens. Yet this capability also increases hallucinations, where the model generates content that is not supported by the input image or the question. To understand this failure mode, we identify \emph{reasoning drift}: during clue gathering, the model over-focuses on question-irrelevant entities, diluting focus on task-relevant cues and gradually decoupling the reasoning trace from visual grounding. As a consequence, many inference-time localization or intervention methods developed for non-reasoning models fail to pinpoint the true clues in reasoning settings. Motivated by these insights, we introduce ClueRecall, a metric for assessing visual clue retrieval, and present ClueTracer, a training-free, parameter-free, and architecture-agnostic plugin for hallucination suppression. ClueTracer starts from the question and traces how key clues propagate along the model's reasoning pathway (question $\rightarrow$ outputs $\rightarrow$ visual tokens), thereby localizing task-relevant patches while suppressing spurious attention to irrelevant regions. Remarkably, \textbf{without any additional training}, ClueTracer improves all \textbf{reasoning} architectures (including \texttt{R1-OneVision}, \texttt{Ocean-R1}, \texttt{MM-Eureka}, \emph{etc}.) by $\mathbf{1.21\times}$ on reasoning benchmarks. When transferred to \textbf{non-reasoning} settings, it yields a $\mathbf{1.14\times}$ gain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02004v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: The Need for Ultrafast Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02005</link><description>arXiv:2602.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-specialized FPGAs have delivered unprecedented performance for low-latency inference across scientific and industrial workloads, yet nearly all existing accelerators assume static models trained offline, relegating learning and adaptation to slower CPUs or GPUs. This separation fundamentally limits systems that must operate in non-stationary, high-frequency environments, where model updates must occur at the timescale of the underlying physics. In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments. Enabling such regimes requires rethinking algorithms, architectures, and toolflows jointly, but promises to transform FPGAs from static inference engines into real-time learning machines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02005v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reformulating AI-based Multi-Object Relative State Estimation for Aleatoric Uncertainty-based Outlier Rejection of Partial Measurements</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02006</link><description>arXiv:2602.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise localization with respect to a set of objects of interest enables mobile robots to perform various tasks. With the rise of edge devices capable of deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) for real-time inference, it stands to reason to use artificial intelligence (AI) for the extraction of object-specific, semantic information from raw image data, such as the object class and the relative six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) pose. However, fusing such AI-based measurements in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) requires quantifying the DNNs' uncertainty and outlier rejection capabilities.
  This paper presents the benefits of reformulating the measurement equation in AI-based, object-relative state estimation. By deriving an EKF using the direct object-relative pose measurement, we can decouple the position and rotation measurements, thus limiting the influence of erroneous rotation measurements and allowing partial measurement rejection. Furthermore, we investigate the performance and consistency improvements for state estimators provided by replacing the fixed measurement covariance matrix of the 6-DoF object-relative pose measurements with the predicted aleatoric uncertainty of the DNN.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02006v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond RAG for Agent Memory: Retrieval by Decoupling and Aggregation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02007</link><description>arXiv:2602.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent memory systems often adopt the standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, yet its underlying assumptions differ in this setting. RAG targets large, heterogeneous corpora where retrieved passages are diverse, whereas agent memory is a bounded, coherent dialogue stream with highly correlated spans that are often duplicates. Under this shift, fixed top-$k$ similarity retrieval tends to return redundant context, and post-hoc pruning can delete temporally linked prerequisites needed for correct reasoning. We argue retrieval should move beyond similarity matching and instead operate over latent components, following decoupling to aggregation: disentangle memories into semantic components, organise them into a hierarchy, and use this structure to drive retrieval. We propose xMemory, which builds a hierarchy of intact units and maintains a searchable yet faithful high-level node organisation via a sparsity--semantics objective that guides memory split and merge. At inference, xMemory retrieves top-down, selecting a compact, diverse set of themes and semantics for multi-fact queries, and expanding to episodes and raw messages only when it reduces the reader's uncertainty. Experiments on LoCoMo and PerLTQA across the three latest LLMs show consistent gains in answer quality and token efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Logic-Guided Vector Fields for Constrained Generative Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02009</link><description>arXiv:2602.02009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic systems aim to combine the expressive structure of symbolic logic with the flexibility of neural learning; yet, generative models typically lack mechanisms to enforce declarative constraints at generation time. We propose Logic-Guided Vector Fields (LGVF), a neuro-symbolic framework that injects symbolic knowledge, specified as differentiable relaxations of logical constraints, into flow matching generative models. LGVF couples two complementary mechanisms: (1) a training-time logic loss that penalizes constraint violations along continuous flow trajectories, with weights that emphasize correctness near the target distribution; and (2) an inference-time adjustment that steers sampling using constraint gradients, acting as a lightweight, logic-informed correction to the learned dynamics. We evaluate LGVF on three constrained generation case studies spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-region feasibility constraints. Across all settings, LGVF reduces constraint violations by 59-82% compared to standard flow matching and achieves the lowest violation rates in each case. In the linear and ring settings, LGVF also improves distributional fidelity as measured by MMD, while in the multi-obstacle setting, we observe a satisfaction-fidelity trade-off, with improved feasibility but increased MMD. Beyond quantitative gains, LGVF yields constraint-aware vector fields exhibiting emergent obstacle-avoidance behavior, routing samples around forbidden regions without explicit path planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02009v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NEAT: Neuron-Based Early Exit for Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02010</link><description>arXiv:2602.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from \emph{overthinking}, a phenomenon in which redundant reasoning steps are generated after a correct solution has already been reached. Existing early reasoning exit methods primarily rely on output-level heuristics or trained probing models to skip redundant reasoning steps, thereby mitigating overthinking. However, these approaches typically require additional rollout computation or externally labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose \textbf{NEAT}, a \textbf{N}euron-based \textbf{E}arly re\textbf{A}soning exi\textbf{T} framework that monitors neuron-level activation dynamics to enable training-free early exits, without introducing additional test-time computation. NEAT identifies exit-associated neurons and tracks their activation patterns during reasoning to dynamically trigger early exit or suppress reflection, thereby reducing unnecessary reasoning while preserving solution quality. Experiments on four reasoning benchmarks across six models with different scales and architectures show that, for each model, NEAT achieves an average token reduction of 22\% to 28\% when averaged over the four benchmarks, while maintaining accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SNAP: A Self-Consistent Agreement Principle with Application to Robust Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02013</link><description>arXiv:2602.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SNAP (Self-coNsistent Agreement Principle), a self-supervised framework for robust computation based on mutual agreement. Based on an Agreement-Reliability Hypothesis SNAP assigns weights that quantify agreement, emphasizing trustworthy items and downweighting outliers without supervision or prior knowledge. A key result is the Exponential Suppression of Outlier Weights, ensuring that outliers contribute negligibly to computations, even in high-dimensional settings. We study properties of SNAP weighting scheme and show its practical benefits on vector averaging and subspace estimation. Particularly, we demonstrate that non-iterative SNAP outperforms the iterative Weiszfeld algorithm and two variants of multivariate median of means. SNAP thus provides a flexible, easy-to-use, broadly applicable approach to robust computation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02013v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Genomic Modeling Through Optical Character Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02014</link><description>arXiv:2602.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent genomic foundation models largely adopt large language model architectures that treat DNA as a one-dimensional token sequence. However, exhaustive sequential reading is structurally misaligned with sparse and discontinuous genomic semantics, leading to wasted computation on low-information background and preventing understanding-driven compression for long contexts. Here, we present OpticalDNA, a vision-based framework that reframes genomic modeling as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-style document understanding. OpticalDNA renders DNA into structured visual layouts and trains an OCR-capable vision--language model with a \emph{visual DNA encoder} and a \emph{document decoder}, where the encoder produces compact, reconstructible visual tokens for high-fidelity compression. Building on this representation, OpticalDNA defines prompt-conditioned objectives over core genomic primitives-reading, region grounding, subsequence retrieval, and masked span completion-thereby learning layout-aware DNA representations that retain fine-grained genomic information under a reduced effective token budget. Across diverse genomic benchmarks, OpticalDNA consistently outperforms recent baselines; on sequences up to 450k bases, it achieves the best overall performance with nearly $20\times$ fewer effective tokens, and surpasses models with up to $985\times$ more activated parameters while tuning only 256k \emph{trainable} parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Domain Generalization under Divergent Marginal and Conditional Distributions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02015</link><description>arXiv:2602.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn predictive models that can generalize to unseen domains. Most existing DG approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations under the assumption of conditional distribution shift (i.e., primarily addressing changes in $P(X\mid Y)$ while assuming $P(Y)$ remains stable). However, real-world scenarios with multiple domains often involve compound distribution shifts where both the marginal label distribution $P(Y)$ and the conditional distribution $P(X\mid Y)$ vary simultaneously. To address this, we propose a unified framework for robust domain generalization under divergent marginal and conditional distributions. We derive a novel risk bound for unseen domains by explicitly decomposing the joint distribution into marginal and conditional components and characterizing risk gaps arising from both sources of divergence. To operationalize this bound, we design a meta-learning procedure that minimizes and validates the proposed risk bound across seen domains, ensuring strong generalization to unseen ones. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on conventional DG benchmarks but also in challenging multi-domain long-tailed recognition settings where both marginal and conditional shifts are pronounced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02015v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DASH: Faster Shampoo via Batched Block Preconditioning and Efficient Inverse-Root Solvers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02016</link><description>arXiv:2602.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shampoo is one of the leading approximate second-order optimizers: a variant of it has won the MLCommons AlgoPerf competition, and it has been shown to produce models with lower activation outliers that are easier to compress. Yet, applying Shampoo currently comes at the cost of significant computational slowdown, due to its expensive internal operations. In this paper, we take a significant step to address this shortcoming by proposing \method (for \textbf{D}istributed \textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{SH}ampoo), a faster implementation of Distributed Shampoo based on two main new techniques: First, we show that preconditioner blocks can be stacked into 3D tensors to significantly improve GPU utilization; second, we introduce the Newton-DB iteration and the Chebyshev polynomial approximations as novel and faster approaches for computing the inverse matrix roots required by Shampoo. Along with these algorithmic contributions, we provide a first in-depth analysis of how matrix scaling critically affects Shampoo convergence. On the practical side, our GPU-aware implementation achieves up to $4.83\times$ faster optimizer steps compared to the well-optimized Distributed Shampoo, while Newton-DB attains the lowest validation perplexity per iteration among all tested methods.

Abstract: Factual hallucination remains a central challenge for large language models (LLMs). Existing mitigation approaches primarily rely on either external post-hoc verification or mapping uncertainty directly to abstention during fine-tuning, often resulting in overly conservative behavior. We propose VeriFY, a training-time framework that teaches LLMs to reason about factual uncertainty through consistency-based self-verification. VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source. The source code, training data, and trained model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scale-covariant spiking wavelets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02020</link><description>arXiv:2602.02020v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Machine learning models depend critically on feature quality, yet useful features are often scattered across multiple relational tables. Feature augmentation enriches a base table by discovering and integrating features from related tables through join operations. However, scaling this process to complex schemas with many tables and multi-hop paths remains challenging. Feature augmentation must address three core tasks: identify promising join paths that connect the base table to candidate tables, execute these joins to materialize augmented data, and select the most informative features from the results. Existing approaches face a fundamental tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency: achieving high accuracy requires exploring many candidate paths, but exhaustive exploration is computationally prohibitive. Some methods compromise by considering only immediate neighbors, limiting their effectiveness, while others employ neural models that require expensive training data and introduce scalability limitations. We present Hippasus, a modular framework that achieves both goals through three key contributions. First, we combine lightweight statistical signals with semantic reasoning from Large Language Models to prune unpromising join paths before execution, focusing computational resources on high-quality candidates. Second, we employ optimized multi-way join algorithms and consolidate features from multiple paths, substantially reducing execution time. Third, we integrate LLM-based semantic understanding with statistical measures to select features that are both semantically meaningful and empirically predictive. Our experimental evaluation on publicly available datasets shows that Hippasus substantially improves feature augmentation accuracy by up to 26.8% over state-of-the-art baselines while also offering high runtime performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02025v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synchronized Online Friction Estimation and Adaptive Grasp Control for Robust Gentle Grasp</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02026</link><description>arXiv:2602.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for gentle robotic grasping that synergistically couples real-time friction estimation with adaptive grasp control. We propose a new particle filter-based method for real-time estimation of the friction coefficient using vision-based tactile sensors. This estimate is seamlessly integrated into a reactive controller that dynamically modulates grasp force to maintain a stable grip. The two processes operate synchronously in a closed-loop: the controller uses the current best estimate to adjust the force, while new tactile feedback from this action continuously refines the estimation. This creates a highly responsive and robust sensorimotor cycle. The reliability and efficiency of the complete framework are validated through extensive robotic experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Light Alignment Improves LLM Safety via Model Self-Reflection with a Single Neuron</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02027</link><description>arXiv:2602.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has increasingly emerged as a fundamental aspect of their development. Existing safety alignment for LLMs is predominantly achieved through post-training methods, which are computationally expensive and often fail to generalize well across different models. A small number of lightweight alignment approaches either rely heavily on prior-computed safety injections or depend excessively on the model's own capabilities, resulting in limited generalization and degraded efficiency and usability during generation. In this work, we propose a safety-aware decoding method that requires only low-cost training of an expert model and employs a single neuron as a gating mechanism. By effectively balancing the model's intrinsic capabilities with external guidance, our approach simultaneously preserves utility and enhances output safety. It demonstrates clear advantages in training overhead and generalization across model scales, offering a new perspective on lightweight alignment for the safe and practical deployment of large language models.

Abstract: Enabling artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models, to integrate new knowledge and flexibly apply it during reasoning remains a central challenge. Existing knowledge editing approaches emphasize atomic facts, improving factual recall but often failing to integrate new information into a coherent framework usable across contexts. In this work, we argue that knowledge internalization is fundamentally a reasoning problem rather than a memorization problem. Consequently, a model should be trained in situations where the new information is instrumental to solving a task, combined with pre-existing knowledge, and exercised through multi-step reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose a training strategy based on three principles. First, new knowledge is introduced as a coherent background story that contextualizes novel facts and explains their relation to existing knowledge. Second, models are trained using self-generated multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning involving the new information. Third, training is done using knowledge distillation, forcing a student model to internalize the teacher's reasoning behavior without access to the novel information. Experiments show that models trained with this strategy effectively leverage newly acquired knowledge during reasoning and achieve remarkable performance on challenging questions that require combining multiple new facts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02028v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Canonical Intermediate Representation for LLM-based optimization problem formulation and code generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02029</link><description>arXiv:2602.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically formulating optimization models from natural language descriptions is a growing focus in operations research, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with the composite constraints and appropriate modeling paradigms required by complex operational rules. To address this, we introduce the Canonical Intermediate Representation (CIR): a schema that LLMs explicitly generate between problem descriptions and optimization models. CIR encodes the semantics of operational rules through constraint archetypes and candidate modeling paradigms, thereby decoupling rule logic from its mathematical instantiation. Upon a newly generated CIR knowledge base, we develop the rule-to-constraint (R2C) framework, a multi-agent pipeline that parses problem texts, synthesizes CIR implementations by retrieving domain knowledge, and instantiates optimization models. To systematically evaluate rule-to-constraint reasoning, we test R2C on our newly constructed benchmark featuring rich operational rules, and benchmarks from prior work. Extensive experiments show that R2C achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the proposed benchmark (47.2% Accuracy Rate). On established benchmarks from the literature, R2C delivers highly competitive results, approaching the performance of proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5). Moreover, with a reflection mechanism, R2C achieves further gains and sets new best-reported results on some benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02029v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One Size, Many Fits: Aligning Diverse Group-Wise Click Preferences in Large-Scale Advertising Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02033</link><description>arXiv:2602.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advertising image generation has increasingly focused on online metrics like Click-Through Rate (CTR), yet existing approaches adopt a ``one-size-fits-all" strategy that optimizes for overall CTR while neglecting preference diversity among user groups. This leads to suboptimal performance for specific groups, limiting targeted marketing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{One Size, Many Fits} (OSMF), a unified framework that aligns diverse group-wise click preferences in large-scale advertising image generation. OSMF begins with product-aware adaptive grouping, which dynamically organizes users based on their attributes and product characteristics, representing each group with rich collective preference features. Building on these groups, preference-conditioned image generation employs a Group-aware Multimodal Large Language Model (G-MLLM) to generate tailored images for each group. The G-MLLM is pre-trained to simultaneously comprehend group features and generate advertising images. Subsequently, we fine-tune the G-MLLM using our proposed Group-DPO for group-wise preference alignment, which effectively enhances each group's CTR on the generated images. To further advance this field, we introduce the Grouped Advertising Image Preference Dataset (GAIP), the first large-scale public dataset of group-wise image preferences, including around 600K groups built from 40M users. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings. Our code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/JD-GenX/OSMF.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02033v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constrained Process Maps for Multi-Agent Generative AI Workflows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02034</link><description>arXiv:2602.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used to perform complex, multi-step workflows in regulated settings such as compliance and due diligence. However, many agentic architectures rely primarily on prompt engineering of a single agent, making it difficult to observe or compare how models handle uncertainty and coordination across interconnected decision stages and with human oversight. We introduce a multi-agent system formalized as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a directed acyclic structure. Each agent corresponds to a specific role or decision stage (e.g., content, business, or legal review in a compliance workflow), with predefined transitions representing task escalation or completion. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified at the agent level using Monte Carlo estimation, while system-level uncertainty is captured by the MDP's termination in either an automated labeled state or a human-review state. We illustrate the approach through a case study in AI safety evaluation for self-harm detection, implemented as a multi-agent compliance system. Results demonstrate improvements over a single-agent baseline, including up to a 19\% increase in accuracy, up to an 85x reduction in required human review, and, in some configurations, reduced processing time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bandwidth-Efficient Multi-Agent Communication through Information Bottleneck and Vector Quantization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02035</link><description>arXiv:2602.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems deployed in real-world robotics applications face severe communication constraints that significantly impact coordination effectiveness. We present a framework that combines information bottleneck theory with vector quantization to enable selective, bandwidth-efficient communication in multi-agent environments. Our approach learns to compress and discretize communication messages while preserving task-critical information through principled information-theoretic optimization. We introduce a gated communication mechanism that dynamically determines when communication is necessary based on environmental context and agent states. Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods. Our approach significantly outperforms existing communication strategies and establishes a theoretically grounded framework for deploying multi-agent systems in bandwidth-constrained environments such as robotic swarms, autonomous vehicle fleets, and distributed sensor networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02035v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Frictional Contact Solving for Material Point Method</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02038</link><description>arXiv:2602.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately handling contact with friction remains a core bottleneck for Material Point Method (MPM), from reliable contact point detection to enforcing frictional contact laws (non-penetration, Coulomb friction, and maximum dissipation principle). In this paper, we introduce a frictional-contact pipeline for implicit MPM that is both precise and robust. During the collision detection phase, contact points are localized with particle-centric geometric primitives; during the contact resolution phase, we cast frictional contact as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) over contact impulses and solve it with an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme. Crucially, the formulation reuses the same implicit MPM linearization, yielding efficiency and numerical stability. The method integrates seamlessly into the implicit MPM loop and is agnostic to modeling choices, including material laws, interpolation functions, and transfer schemes. We evaluate it across seven representative scenes that span elastic and elasto-plastic responses, simple and complex deformable geometries, and a wide range of contact conditions. Overall, the proposed method enables accurate contact localization, reliable frictional handling, and broad generality, making it a practical solution for MPM-based simulations in robotics and related domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02038v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hunt Instead of Wait: Evaluating Deep Data Research on Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02039</link><description>arXiv:2602.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The agency expected of Agentic Large Language Models goes beyond answering correctly, requiring autonomy to set goals and decide what to explore. We term this investigatory intelligence, distinguishing it from executional intelligence, which merely completes assigned tasks. Data Science provides a natural testbed, as real-world analysis starts from raw data rather than explicit queries, yet few benchmarks focus on it. To address this, we introduce Deep Data Research (DDR), an open-ended task where LLMs autonomously extract key insights from databases, and DDR-Bench, a large-scale, checklist-based benchmark that enables verifiable evaluation. Results show that while frontier models display emerging agency, long-horizon exploration remains challenging. Our analysis highlights that effective investigatory intelligence depends not only on agent scaffolding or merely scaling, but also on intrinsic strategies of agentic models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02039v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Auto-Comp: An Automated Pipeline for Scalable Compositional Probing of Contrastive Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02043</link><description>arXiv:2602.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a critical flaw in compositional reasoning, often confusing "a red cube and a blue sphere" with "a blue cube and a red sphere". Disentangling the visual and linguistic roots of these failures is a fundamental challenge for robust evaluation. To enable fine-grained, controllable analysis, we introduce Auto-Comp, a fully automated and synthetic pipeline for generating scalable benchmarks. Its controllable nature is key to dissecting and isolating different reasoning skills. Auto-Comp generates paired images from Minimal (e.g., "a monitor to the left of a bicycle on a white background") and LLM-generated Contextual captions (e.g., "In a brightly lit photography studio, a monitor is positioned to the left of a bicycle"), allowing a controlled A/B test to disentangle core binding ability from visio-linguistic complexity. Our evaluation of 20 VLMs on novel benchmarks for color binding and spatial relations reveals universal compositional failures in both CLIP and SigLIP model families. Crucially, our novel "Confusion Benchmark" reveals a deeper flaw beyond simple attribute swaps: models are highly susceptible to low-entropy distractors (e.g., repeated objects or colors), demonstrating their compositional failures extend beyond known bag-of-words limitations. we uncover a surprising trade-off: visio-linguistic context, which provides global scene cues, aids spatial reasoning but simultaneously hinders local attribute binding by introducing visual clutter. We release the Auto-Comp pipeline to facilitate future benchmark creation, alongside all our generated benchmarks (https://huggingface.co/AutoComp).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02043v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Twinning Complex Networked Systems: Data-Driven Calibration of the mABCD Synthetic Graph Generator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02044</link><description>arXiv:2602.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of relational data has contributed to a growing reliance on network-based representations of complex systems. Over time, these models have evolved to capture more nuanced properties, such as the heterogeneity of relationships, leading to the concept of multilayer networks. However, the analysis and evaluation of methods for these structures is often hindered by the limited availability of large-scale empirical data. As a result, graph generators are commonly used as a workaround, albeit at the cost of introducing systematic biases. In this paper, we address the inverse-generator problem by inferring the configuration parameters of a multilayer network generator, mABCD, from a real-world system. Our goal is to identify parameter settings that enable the generator to produce synthetic networks that act as digital twins of the original structure. We propose a method for estimating matching configurations and for quantifying the associated error. Our results demonstrate that this task is non-trivial, as strong interdependencies between configuration parameters weaken independent estimation and instead favour a joint-prediction approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02044v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Stability and Robustness of Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Bayesian Inverse Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02045</link><description>arXiv:2602.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful learned priors for Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). Diffusion-based solvers rely on a presumed likelihood for the observations in BIPs to guide the generation process. However, the link between likelihood and recovery quality for BIPs is unclear in previous works. We bridge this gap by characterizing the posterior approximation error and proving the \emph{stability} of the diffusion-based solvers. Meanwhile, an immediate result of our findings on stability demonstrates the lack of robustness in diffusion-based solvers, which remains unexplored. This can degrade performance when the presumed likelihood mismatches the unknown true data generation processes. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution, \emph{robust diffusion posterior sampling}, which is provably \emph{robust} and compatible with existing gradient-based posterior samplers. Empirical results on scientific inverse problems and natural image tasks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, showing consistent performance improvements under challenging likelihood misspecifications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02045v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dissecting Outlier Dynamics in LLM NVFP4 Pretraining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02047</link><description>arXiv:2602.02047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models using 4-bit arithmetic enhances throughput and memory efficiency. Yet, the limited dynamic range of FP4 increases sensitivity to outliers. While NVFP4 mitigates quantization error via hierarchical microscaling, a persistent loss gap remains compared to BF16. This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of outlier dynamics across architecture during NVFP4 pretraining, focusing on where they localize, why they occur, and how they evolve temporally. We find that, compared with Softmax Attention (SA), Linear Attention (LA) reduces per-tensor heavy tails but still exhibits persistent block-level spikes under block quantization. Our analysis attributes outliers to specific architectural components: Softmax in SA, gating in LA, and SwiGLU in FFN, with "post-QK" operations exhibiting higher sensitivity to quantization. Notably, outliers evolve from transient spikes early in training to a small set of persistent hot channels (i.e., channels with persistently large magnitudes) in later stages. Based on these findings, we introduce Hot-Channel Patch (HCP), an online compensation mechanism that identifies hot channels and reinjects residuals using hardware-efficient kernels. We then develop CHON, an NVFP4 training recipe integrating HCP with post-QK operation protection. On GLA-1.3B model trained for 60B tokens, CHON reduces the loss gap to BF16 from 0.94% to 0.58% while maintaining downstream accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are Semantic Networks Associated with Idea Originality in Artificial Creativity?

Abstract: The application of generative artificial intelligence in Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) presents the challenge of interfacing two black boxes: the user's mind and the machine engine. According to Artificial Cognition, this challenge involves theories, methods, and constructs developed to study human creativity. Consistently, the paper investigated the relationship between semantic networks organisation and idea originality in Large Language Models. Data was collected by administering a set of standardised tests to ChatGPT-4o and 81 psychology students, divided into higher and lower creative individuals. The expected relationship was confirmed in the comparison between ChatGPT-4o and higher creative humans. However, despite having a more rigid network, ChatGPT-4o emerged as more original than lower creative humans. We attributed this difference to human motivational processes and model hyperparameters, advancing a research agenda for the study of artificial creativity. In conclusion, we illustrate the potential of this construct for designing and evaluating CSTs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking the Role of Entropy in Optimizing Tool-Use Behaviors for Large Language Model Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02050</link><description>arXiv:2602.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-using agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and multi-hop question answering. However, in long trajectories, agents often trigger excessive and low-quality tool calls, increasing latency and degrading inference performance, making managing tool-use behavior challenging. In this work, we conduct entropy-based pilot experiments and observe a strong positive correlation between entropy reduction and high-quality tool calls. Building on this finding, we propose using entropy reduction as a supervisory signal and design two reward strategies to address the differing needs of optimizing tool-use behavior. Sparse outcome rewards provide coarse, trajectory-level guidance to improve efficiency, while dense process rewards offer fine-grained supervision to enhance performance. Experiments across diverse domains show that both reward designs improve tool-use behavior: the former reduces tool calls by 72.07% compared to the average of baselines, while the latter improves performance by 22.27%. These results position entropy reduction as a key mechanism for enhancing tool-use behavior, enabling agents to be more adaptive in real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02050v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SIDiffAgent: Self-Improving Diffusion Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02051</link><description>arXiv:2602.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, enabling high-quality and photorealistic image synthesis. However, their practical deployment remains hindered by several limitations: sensitivity to prompt phrasing, ambiguity in semantic interpretation (e.g., ``mouse" as animal vs. a computer peripheral), artifacts such as distorted anatomy, and the need for carefully engineered input prompts. Existing methods often require additional training and offer limited controllability, restricting their adaptability in real-world applications. We introduce Self-Improving Diffusion Agent (SIDiffAgent), a training-free agentic framework that leverages the Qwen family of models (Qwen-VL, Qwen-Image, Qwen-Edit, Qwen-Embedding) to address these challenges. SIDiffAgent autonomously manages prompt engineering, detects and corrects poor generations, and performs fine-grained artifact removal, yielding more reliable and consistent outputs. It further incorporates iterative self-improvement by storing a memory of previous experiences in a database. This database of past experiences is then used to inject prompt-based guidance at each stage of the agentic pipeline. \modelour achieved an average VQA score of 0.884 on GenAIBench, significantly outperforming open-source, proprietary models and agentic methods.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) organizes external knowledge as a hierarchical graph, enabling efficient retrieval and aggregation of scattered evidence across multiple documents. However, many existing benchmarks for GraphRAG rely on short, curated passages as external knowledge, failing to adequately evaluate systems in realistic settings involving long contexts and large-scale heterogeneous documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce WildGraphBench, a benchmark designed to assess GraphRAG performance in the wild. We leverage Wikipedia's unique structure, where cohesive narratives are grounded in long and heterogeneous external reference documents, to construct a benchmark reflecting real-word scenarios. Specifically, we sample articles across 12 top-level topics, using their external references as the retrieval corpus and citation-linked statements as ground truth, resulting in 1,100 questions spanning three levels of complexity: single-fact QA, multi-fact QA, and section-level summarization. Experiments across multiple baselines reveal that current GraphRAG pipelines help on multi-fact aggregation when evidence comes from a moderate number of sources, but this aggregation paradigm may overemphasize high-level statements at the expense of fine-grained details, leading to weaker performance on summarization tasks.

Abstract: Ultrafast online learning is essential for high-frequency systems, such as controls for quantum computing and nuclear fusion, where adaptation must occur on sub-microsecond timescales. Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QVCache: A Query-Aware Vector Cache</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02057</link><description>arXiv:2602.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector databases have become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval, powering applications in recommendation, search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. However, scaling approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to high recall under strict latency SLOs remains fundamentally constrained by memory capacity and I/O bandwidth. Disk-based vector search systems suffer severe latency degradation at high accuracy, while fully in-memory solutions incur prohibitive memory costs at billion-scale. Despite the central role of caching in traditional databases, vector search lacks a general query-level caching layer capable of amortizing repeated query work.
  We present QVCache, the first backend-agnostic, query-level caching system for ANN search with bounded memory footprint. QVCache exploits semantic query repetition by performing similarity-aware caching rather than exact-match lookup. It dynamically learns region-specific distance thresholds using an online learning algorithm, enabling recall-preserving cache hits while bounding lookup latency and memory usage independently of dataset size. QVCache operates as a drop-in layer for existing vector databases. It maintains a megabyte-scale memory footprint and achieves sub-millisecond cache-hit latency, reducing end-to-end query latency by up to 40-1000x when integrated with existing ANN systems. For workloads exhibiting temporal-semantic locality, QVCache substantially reduces latency while preserving recall comparable to the underlying ANN backend, establishing it as a missing but essential caching layer for scalable vector search.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02057v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FiLoRA: Focus-and-Ignore LoRA for Controllable Feature Reliance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02060</link><description>arXiv:2602.02060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models integrate heterogeneous signals across modalities, yet it remains poorly understood how their predictions depend on specific internal feature groups and whether such reliance can be deliberately controlled. Existing studies of shortcut and spurious behavior largely rely on post hoc analyses or feature removal, offering limited insight into whether reliance can be modulated without altering task semantics. We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02060v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Route and Schedule LLMs from User Retrials via Contextual Queueing Bandits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02061</link><description>arXiv:2602.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explosive demands for LLMs often cause user queries to accumulate in server queues, requiring efficient routing (query-LLM matching) and scheduling (query prioritization) mechanisms. Several online algorithms are being deployed, but they overlook the following two key challenges inherent to conversational LLM services: (1) unsatisfied users may retry queries, increasing the server backlog, and (2) requests for ``explicit" feedback, such as ratings, degrade user experiences. In this paper, we develop a joint routing and scheduling algorithm that leverages ``implicit" feedback inferred from user retrial behaviors. The key idea is to propose and study the framework of contextual queueing bandits with multinomial logit feedback (CQB-MNL). CQB-MNL models query retrials, as well as context-based learning for user preferences over LLMs. Our algorithm, anytime CQB (ACQB), achieves efficient learning while maintaining queue stability by combining Thompson sampling with forced exploration at a decaying rate. We show that ACQB simultaneously achieves a cumulative regret of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{t})$ for routing and a queue length regret of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/4})$ for any large $t$. For experiments, we refine query embeddings via contrastive learning while adopting a disjoint parameter model to learn LLM-specific parameters. Experiments on SPROUT, EmbedLLM, and RouterBench datasets confirm that both algorithms consistently outperform baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02061v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] See2Refine: Vision-Language Feedback Improves LLM-Based eHMI Action Designers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02063</link><description>arXiv:2602.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated vehicles lack natural communication channels with other road users, making external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) essential for conveying intent and maintaining trust in shared environments. However, most eHMI studies rely on developer-crafted message-action pairs, which are difficult to adapt to diverse and dynamic traffic contexts. A promising alternative is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as action designers that generate context-conditioned eHMI actions, yet such designers lack perceptual verification and typically depend on fixed prompts or costly human-annotated feedback for improvement. We present See2Refine, a human-free, closed-loop framework that uses vision-language model (VLM) perceptual evaluation as automated visual feedback to improve an LLM-based eHMI action designer. Given a driving context and a candidate eHMI action, the VLM evaluates the perceived appropriateness of the action, and this feedback is used to iteratively revise the designer's outputs, enabling systematic refinement without human supervision. We evaluate our framework across three eHMI modalities (lightbar, eyes, and arm) and multiple LLM model sizes. Across settings, our framework consistently outperforms prompt-only LLM designers and manually specified baselines in both VLM-based metrics and human-subject evaluations. Results further indicate that the improvements generalize across modalities and that VLM evaluations are well aligned with human preferences, supporting the robustness and effectiveness of See2Refine for scalable action design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Approximation of Functions: Optimal Sampling and Complexity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02066</link><description>arXiv:2602.02066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider approximation or recovery of functions based on a finite number of function evaluations. This is a well-studied problem in optimal recovery, machine learning, and numerical analysis in general, but many fundamental insights were obtained only recently. We discuss different aspects of the information-theoretic limit that appears because of the limited amount of data available, as well as algorithms and sampling strategies that come as close to it as possible.
  We also discuss (optimal) sampling in a broader sense, allowing other types of measurements that may be nonlinear, adaptive and random, and present several relations between the different settings in the spirit of information-based complexity. We hope that this article provides both, a basic introduction to the subject and a contemporary summary of the current state of research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02066v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-View Stenosis Classification Leveraging Transformer-Based Multiple-Instance Learning Using Real-World Clinical Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02067</link><description>arXiv:2602.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary artery stenosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, diagnosed by analyzing the coronary arteries from multiple angiography views. Although numerous deep-learning models have been proposed for stenosis detection from a single angiography view, their performance heavily relies on expensive view-level annotations, which are often not readily available in hospital systems. Moreover, these models fail to capture the temporal dynamics and dependencies among multiple views, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. To address this, we propose SegmentMIL, a transformer-based multi-view multiple-instance learning framework for patient-level stenosis classification. Trained on a real-world clinical dataset, using patient-level supervision and without any view-level annotations, SegmentMIL jointly predicts the presence of stenosis and localizes the affected anatomical region, distinguishing between the right and left coronary arteries and their respective segments. SegmentMIL obtains high performance on internal and external evaluations and outperforms both view-level models and classical MIL baselines, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable and scalable solution for coronary stenosis diagnosis.

Abstract: The present work addresses the Cauchy problem for an abstract nonlinear system of coupled hyperbolic equations associated with the Timoshenko model in a real Hilbert space. Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BAPS: A Fine-Grained Low-Precision Scheme for Softmax in Attention via Block-Aware Precision reScaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02071</link><description>arXiv:2602.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the performance gains from accelerating quantized matrix multiplication plateau, the softmax operation becomes the critical bottleneck in Transformer inference. This bottleneck stems from two hardware limitations: (1) limited data bandwidth between matrix and vector compute cores, and (2) the significant area cost of high-precision (FP32/16) exponentiation units (EXP2). To address these issues, we introduce a novel low-precision workflow that employs a specific 8-bit floating-point format (HiF8) and block-aware precision rescaling for softmax. Crucially, our algorithmic innovations make low-precision softmax feasible without the significant model accuracy loss that hampers direct low-precision approaches. Specifically, our design (i) halves the required data movement bandwidth by enabling matrix multiplication outputs constrained to 8-bit, and (ii) substantially reduces the EXP2 unit area by computing exponentiations in low (8-bit) precision. Extensive evaluation on language models and multi-modal models confirms the validity of our method. By alleviating the vector computation bottleneck, our work paves the way for doubling end-to-end inference throughput without increasing chip area, and offers a concrete co-design path for future low-precision hardware and software.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02071v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Calibrating Adaptive Smoothing Methods for Freeway Traffic Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02072</link><description>arXiv:2602.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptive smoothing method (ASM) is a widely used approach for traffic state reconstruction. This article presents a Python implementation of ASM, featuring end-to-end calibration using real-world ground truth data. The calibration is formulated as a parameterized kernel optimization problem. The model is calibrated using data from a full-state observation testbed, with input from a sparse radar sensor network. The implementation is developed in PyTorch, enabling integration with various deep learning methods. We evaluate the results in terms of speed distribution, spatio-temporal error distribution, and spatial error to provide benchmark metrics for the traffic reconstruction problem. We further demonstrate the usability of the calibrated method across multiple freeways. Finally, we discuss the challenges of reproducibility in general traffic model calibration and the limitations of ASM. This article is reproducible and can serve as a benchmark for various freeway operation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02072v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AICD Bench: A Challenging Benchmark for AI-Generated Code Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02079</link><description>arXiv:2602.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating functional source code, raising concerns about authorship, accountability, and security. While detecting AI-generated code is critical, existing datasets and benchmarks are narrow, typically limited to binary human-machine classification under in-distribution settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce $\emph{AICD Bench}$, the most comprehensive benchmark for AI-generated code detection. It spans $\emph{2M examples}$, $\emph{77 models}$ across $\emph{11 families}$, and $\emph{9 programming languages}$, including recent reasoning models. Beyond scale, AICD Bench introduces three realistic detection tasks: ($\emph{i}$)~$\emph{Robust Binary Classification}$ under distribution shifts in language and domain, ($\emph{ii}$)~$\emph{Model Family Attribution}$, grouping generators by architectural lineage, and ($\emph{iii}$)~$\emph{Fine-Grained Human-Machine Classification}$ across human, machine, hybrid, and adversarial code. Extensive evaluation on neural and classical detectors shows that performance remains far below practical usability, particularly under distribution shift and for hybrid or adversarial code. We release AICD Bench as a $\emph{unified, challenging evaluation suite}$ to drive the next generation of robust approaches for AI-generated code detection. The data and the code are available at https://huggingface.co/AICD-bench}.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02079v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Half-Spaces from Perturbed Contrastive Examples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02080</link><description>arXiv:2602.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study learning under a two-step contrastive example oracle, as introduced by Mansouri et. al. (2025), where each queried (or sampled) labeled example is paired with an additional contrastive example of opposite label. While Mansouri et al. assume an idealized setting, where the contrastive example is at minimum distance of the originally queried/sampled point, we introduce and analyze a mechanism, parameterized by a non-decreasing noise function $f$, under which this ideal contrastive example is perturbed. The amount of perturbation is controlled by $f(d)$, where $d$ is the distance of the queried/sampled point to the decision boundary. Intuitively, this results in higher-quality contrastive examples for points closer to the decision boundary. We study this model in two settings: (i) when the maximum perturbation magnitude is fixed, and (ii) when it is stochastic.
  For one-dimensional thresholds and for half-spaces under the uniform distribution on a bounded domain, we characterize active and passive contrastive sample complexity in dependence on the function $f$. We show that, under certain conditions on $f$, the presence of contrastive examples speeds up learning in terms of asymptotic query complexity and asymptotic expected query complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02080v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active learning from positive and unlabeled examples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02081</link><description>arXiv:2602.02081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning) is a weakly supervised variant of binary classification in which the learner receives labels only for (some) positively labeled instances, while all other examples remain unlabeled. Motivated by applications such as advertising and anomaly detection, we study an active PU learning setting where the learner can adaptively query instances from an unlabeled pool, but a queried label is revealed only when the instance is positive and an independent coin flip succeeds; otherwise the learner receives no information. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the label complexity of active PU learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02081v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Closing the Loop: Universal Repository Representation with RPG-Encoder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02084</link><description>arXiv:2602.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current repository agents encounter a reasoning disconnect due to fragmented representations, as existing methods rely on isolated API documentation or dependency graphs that lack semantic depth. We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within a unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, a framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from a static generative blueprint into a unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite. These results highlight our superior fine-grained localization accuracy in complex codebases. Furthermore, it achieves 98.5% reconstruction coverage on RepoCraft, confirming RPG's high-fidelity capacity to mirror the original codebase and closing the loop between intent and implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02084v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UrbanGS: A Scalable and Efficient Architecture for Geometrically Accurate Large-Scene Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02089</link><description>arXiv:2602.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality, real-time rendering for bounded scenes, its extension to large-scale urban environments gives rise to critical challenges in terms of geometric consistency, memory efficiency, and computational scalability. To address these issues, we present UrbanGS, a scalable reconstruction framework that effectively tackles these challenges for city-scale applications. First, we propose a Depth-Consistent D-Normal Regularization module. Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on monocular normal estimators, which can effectively update rotation parameters yet struggle to update position parameters, our method integrates D-Normal constraints with external depth supervision. This allows for comprehensive updates of all geometric parameters. By further incorporating an adaptive confidence weighting mechanism based on gradient consistency and inverse depth deviation, our approach significantly enhances multi-view depth alignment and geometric coherence, which effectively resolves the issue of geometric accuracy in complex large-scale scenes. To improve scalability, we introduce a Spatially Adaptive Gaussian Pruning (SAGP) strategy, which dynamically adjusts Gaussian density based on local geometric complexity and visibility to reduce redundancy. Additionally, a unified partitioning and view assignment scheme is designed to eliminate boundary artifacts and optimize computational load. Extensive experiments on multiple urban datasets demonstrate that UrbanGS achieves superior performance in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and memory efficiency, providing a systematic solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LEC-KG: An LLM-Embedding Collaborative Framework for Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph Construction -- A Case Study on SDGs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02090</link><description>arXiv:2602.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing domain-specific knowledge graphs from unstructured text remains challenging due to heterogeneous entity mentions, long-tail relation distributions, and the absence of standardized schemas. We present LEC-KG, a bidirectional collaborative framework that integrates the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the structural reasoning of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE). Our approach features three key components: (1) hierarchical coarse-to-fine relation extraction that mitigates long-tail bias, (2) evidence-guided Chain-of-Thought feedback that grounds structural suggestions in source text, and (3) semantic initialization that enables structural validation for unseen entities. The two modules enhance each other iteratively-KGE provides structure-aware feedback to refine LLM extractions, while validated triples progressively improve KGE representations. We evaluate LEC-KG on Chinese Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) reports, demonstrating substantial improvements over LLM baselines, particularly on low-frequency relations. Through iterative refinement, our framework reliably transforms unstructured policy text into validated knowledge graph triples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02090v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FSVideo: Fast Speed Video Diffusion Model in a Highly-Compressed Latent Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02092</link><description>arXiv:2602.02092v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models learn by reconstructing masked gene expression, implicitly treating technical noise as signal. With dropout rates exceeding 90%, reconstruction objectives encourage models to encode measurement artifacts rather than stable cellular programs. We introduce Cell-JEPA, a joint-embedding predictive architecture that shifts learning from reconstructing sparse counts to predicting in latent space. The key insight is that cell identity is redundantly encoded across genes. We show predicting cell-level embeddings from partial observations forces the model to learn dropout-robust features. On cell-type clustering, Cell-JEPA achieves 0.72 AvgBIO in zero-shot transfer versus 0.53 for scGPT, a 36% relative improvement. On perturbation prediction within a single cell line, Cell-JEPA improves absolute-state reconstruction but not effect-size estimation, suggesting that representation learning and perturbation modeling address complementary aspects of cellular prediction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02093v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convex limiting for finite elements and its relationship to residual distribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02095</link><description>arXiv:2602.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some recent advances in the field of element-based algebraic stabilization for continuous finite element discretizations of nonlinear hyperbolic problems. The main focus is on multidimensional convex limiting techniques designed to constrain antidiffusive element contributions rather than fluxes. We show that the resulting schemes can be interpreted as residual distribution methods. Two kinds of convex limiting can be used to enforce the validity of generalized discrete maximum principles in this context. The first approach has the structure of a localized flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm, in which the computation of a low-order predictor is followed by an antidiffusive correction stage. The second option is the use of a monolithic convex limiting (MCL) procedure at the level of spatial semi-discretization. In both cases, inequality constraints are imposed on scalar functions of intermediate states that are required to stay in convex invariant sets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02095v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probabilistic Performance Guarantees for Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02098</link><description>arXiv:2602.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning trains generalist policies that can execute multiple tasks. While recent years have seen significant progress, existing approaches rarely provide formal performance guarantees, which are indispensable when deploying policies in safety-critical settings. We present an approach for computing high-confidence guarantees on the performance of a multi-task policy on tasks not seen during training. Concretely, we introduce a new generalisation bound that composes (i) per-task lower confidence bounds from finitely many rollouts with (ii) task-level generalisation from finitely many sampled tasks, yielding a high-confidence guarantee for new tasks drawn from the same arbitrary and unknown distribution. Across state-of-the-art multi-task RL methods, we show that the guarantees are theoretically sound and informative at realistic sample sizes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02098v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Think Dense, Not Long: Dynamic Decoupled Conditional Advantage for Efficient Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02099</link><description>arXiv:2602.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong multi-step reasoning, yet it often encourages overly verbose traces. Moreover, naive length penalties in group-relative optimization can severely hurt accuracy. We attribute this failure to two structural issues: (i) Dilution of Length Baseline, where incorrect responses (with zero length reward) depress the group baseline and over-penalize correct solutions; and (ii) Difficulty-Penalty Mismatch, where a static penalty cannot adapt to problem difficulty, suppressing necessary reasoning on hard instances while leaving redundancy on easy ones. We propose Dynamic Decoupled Conditional Advantage (DDCA) to decouple efficiency optimization from correctness. DDCA computes length advantages conditionally within the correct-response cluster to eliminate baseline dilution, and dynamically scales the penalty strength using the group pass rate as a proxy for difficulty. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, AMC23, and AIME25 show that DDCA consistently improves the efficiency--accuracy trade-off relative to adaptive baselines, reducing generated tokens by approximately 60% on simpler tasks (e.g., GSM8K) versus over 20% on harder benchmarks (e.g., AIME25), thereby maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: The growth of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has shifted disinformation production from manual fabrication to automated, large-scale manipulation. This article presents findings from the first wave of a longitudinal expert perception survey (N=21) involving AI researchers, policymakers, and disinformation specialists. It examines the perceived severity of multimodal threats -- text, image, audio, and video -- and evaluates current mitigation strategies.
  Results indicate that while deepfake video presents immediate "shock" value, large-scale text generation poses a systemic risk of "epistemic fragmentation" and "synthetic consensus," particularly in the political domain. The survey reveals skepticism about technical detection tools, with experts favoring provenance standards and regulatory frameworks despite implementation barriers.
  GenAI disinformation research requires reproducible methods. The current challenge is measurement: without standardized benchmarks and reproducibility checklists, tracking or countering synthetic media remains difficult. We propose treating information integrity as an infrastructure with rigor in data provenance and methodological reproducibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02100v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] No Global Plan in Chain-of-Thought: Uncover the Latent Planning Horizon of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02103</link><description>arXiv:2602.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work stems from prior complementary observations on the dynamics of Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Large Language Models (LLMs) is shown latent planning of subsequent reasoning prior to CoT emergence, thereby diminishing the significance of explicit CoT; whereas CoT remains critical for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs have been released by frontier labs; however, sovereign Large Language Models (for languages other than English) remain low in supply yet high in demand. Training large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages such as Hebrew poses unique challenges. In this paper, we introduce Dicta-LM 3.0: an open-weight collection of LLMs trained on substantially-sized corpora of Hebrew and English texts. The model is released in three sizes: 24B - adapted from the Mistral-Small-3.1 base model, 12B - adapted from the NVIDIA Nemotron Nano V2 model, and 1.7B - adapted from the Qwen3-1.7B base model. We are releasing multiple variants of each model, each with a native context length of 65k tokens; base model and chat model with tool-calling support. To rigorously evaluate our models, we introduce a new benchmark suite for evaluation of Hebrew chat-LLMs, covering a diverse set of tasks including Translation, Summarization, Winograd, Israeli Trivia, and Diacritization (nikud). Our work not only addresses the intricacies of training LLMs in low-resource languages but also proposes a framework that can be leveraged for adapting other LLMs to various non-English languages, contributing to the broader field of multilingual NLP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02104v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Teacher-Guided Student Self-Knowledge Distillation Using Diffusion Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02107</link><description>arXiv:2602.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods often align feature information between teacher and student by exploring meaningful feature processing and loss functions. However, due to the difference in feature distributions between the teacher and student, the student model may learn incompatible information from the teacher. To address this problem, we propose teacher-guided student Diffusion Self-KD, dubbed as DSKD. Instead of the direct teacher-student alignment, we leverage the teacher classifier to guide the sampling process of denoising student features through a light-weight diffusion model. We then propose a novel locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-guided feature distillation method between the original and denoised student features. The denoised student features encapsulate teacher knowledge and could be regarded as a teacher role. In this way, our DSKD method could eliminate discrepancies in mapping manners and feature distributions between the teacher and student, while learning meaningful knowledge from the teacher. Experiments on visual recognition tasks demonstrate that DSKD significantly outperforms existing KD methods across various models and datasets.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) on long contexts is severely constrained by prohibitive GPU memory overhead, not training time. The primary culprits are the activations, whose memory footprints scale linearly with sequence length. We introduce OOMB, a highly memory-efficient training system that directly confronts this barrier. Our approach employs a chunk-recurrent training framework with on-the-fly activation recomputation, which maintains a constant activation memory footprint (O(1)) and shifts the primary bottleneck to the growing KV cache. To manage the KV cache, OOMB integrates a suite of synergistic optimizations: a paged memory manager for both the KV cache and its gradients to eliminate fragmentation, asynchronous CPU offloading to hide data transfer latency, and page-level sparse attention to reduce both computational complexity and communication overhead. The synergy of these techniques yields exceptional efficiency. Our empirical results show that for every additional 10K tokens of context, the end-to-end training memory overhead increases by a mere 10MB for Qwen2.5-7B. This allows training Qwen2.5-7B with a 4M-token context on a single H200 GPU, a feat that would otherwise require a large cluster using context parallelism. This work represents a substantial advance in resource efficiency for long-context LLM training.

Abstract: World models learn an internal representation of environment dynamics, enabling agents to simulate and reason about future states within a compact latent space for tasks such as planning, prediction, and inference. However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) are a potential alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) for language generation, but generation quality depends critically on the generation order. Prior work either hard-codes an ordering (e.g., blockwise left-to-right) or learns an ordering policy for a pretrained MDM, which incurs extra cost and can yield suboptimal solutions due to the two-stage optimization. Motivated by this, we propose order-expressive masked diffusion model (OeMDM) for a broad class of diffusion generative processes with various generation orders, enabling the interpretation of MDM, ARM, and block diffusion in a single framework. Furthermore, building on OeMDM, we introduce learnable-order masked diffusion model (LoMDM), which jointly learns the generation ordering and diffusion backbone through a single objective from scratch, enabling the diffusion model to generate text in context-dependent ordering. Empirically, we confirm that LoMDM outperforms various discrete diffusion models across multiple language modeling benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Diffusion-Based Quantitatively Controllable Image Generation via Matrix-Form EDM and Adaptive Vicinal Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02114</link><description>arXiv:2602.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous Conditional Diffusion Model (CCDM) is a diffusion-based framework designed to generate high-quality images conditioned on continuous regression labels. Although CCDM has demonstrated clear advantages over prior approaches across a range of datasets, it still exhibits notable limitations and has recently been surpassed by a GAN-based method, namely CcGAN-AVAR. These limitations mainly arise from its reliance on an outdated diffusion framework and its low sampling efficiency due to long sampling trajectories. To address these issues, we propose an improved CCDM framework, termed iCCDM, which incorporates the more advanced \textit{Elucidated Diffusion Model} (EDM) framework with substantial modifications to improve both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Specifically, iCCDM introduces a novel matrix-form EDM formulation together with an adaptive vicinal training strategy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, spanning image resolutions from $64\times64$ to $256\times256$, demonstrate that iCCDM consistently outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3, FLUX.1, and Qwen-Image), achieving higher generation quality while significantly reducing sampling cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Maximum von Neumann Entropy Principle: Theory and Applications in Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02117</link><description>arXiv:2602.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Von Neumann entropy (VNE) is a fundamental quantity in quantum information theory and has recently been adopted in machine learning as a spectral measure of diversity for kernel matrices and kernel covariance operators. While maximizing VNE under constraints is well known in quantum settings, a principled analogue of the classical maximum entropy framework, particularly its decision theoretic and game theoretic interpretation, has not been explicitly developed for VNE in data driven contexts. In this paper, we extend the minimax formulation of the maximum entropy principle due to Gr\"unwald and Dawid to the setting of von Neumann entropy, providing a game-theoretic justification for VNE maximization over density matrices and trace-normalized positive semidefinite operators. This perspective yields a robust interpretation of maximum VNE solutions under partial information and clarifies their role as least committed inferences in spectral domains. We then illustrate how the resulting Maximum VNE principle applies to modern machine learning problems by considering two representative applications, selecting a kernel representation from multiple normalized embeddings via kernel-based VNE maximization, and completing kernel matrices from partially observed entries. These examples demonstrate how the proposed framework offers a unifying information-theoretic foundation for VNE-based methods in kernel learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02117v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convergence of a least-squares splitting method for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02118</link><description>arXiv:2602.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the theoretical convergence of the nonlinear least-squares splitting method for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation in which each iteration decouples the pointwise nonlinearity from the differential operator and consists of a local nonlinear update followed by the solution of two sequential Poisson-type elliptic problems. While the method performs well in computations, a rigorous convergence theory has remained unavailable. We observe that the iteration admits a reformulation as an alternating-projection scheme on Sobolev spaces $H^m$, $m\ge 0$. At a solution, the G\^ateaux differentials of the projection maps are the linear projections onto the corresponding tangent spaces. We prove that these tangent spaces are transverse, and hence the linearization of the alternating-projection map is a contraction by classical Hilbert-space theory for alternating projections. Building on this geometric characterization, we prove linear convergence in $H^2$ of the splitting method on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ for initial data sufficiently close to a solution $u\in H^4$. To the best of our knowledge, this yields the first rigorous convergence result for this splitting method in the periodic setting and provides a functional-analytic explanation for its observed numerical robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02118v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CHAOS: Controlled Hardware fAult injectOr System for gem5</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02119</link><description>arXiv:2602.02119v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We propose MLV-Edit, a training-free, flow-based framework that address the unique challenges of minute-level video editing. While existing techniques excel in short-form video manipulation, scaling them to long-duration videos remains challenging due to prohibitive computational overhead and the difficulty of maintaining global temporal consistency across thousands of frames. To address this, MLV-Edit employs a divide-and-conquer strategy for segment-wise editing, facilitated by two core modules: Velocity Blend rectifies motion inconsistencies at segment boundaries by aligning the flow fields of adjacent chunks, eliminating flickering and boundary artifacts commonly observed in fragmented video processing; and Attention Sink anchors local segment features to global reference frames, effectively suppressing cumulative structural drift. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MLV-Edit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of temporal stability and semantic fidelity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toxicity Assessment in Preclinical Histopathology via Class-Aware Mahalanobis Distance for Known and Novel Anomalies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02124</link><description>arXiv:2602.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-induced toxicity remains a leading cause of failure in preclinical development and early clinical trials. Detecting adverse effects at an early stage is critical to reduce attrition and accelerate the development of safe medicines. Histopathological evaluation remains the gold standard for toxicity assessment, but it relies heavily on expert pathologists, creating a bottleneck for large-scale screening. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-based anomaly detection framework for histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) in rodent livers from toxicology studies. The system identifies healthy tissue and known pathologies (anomalies) for which training data is available. In addition, it can detect rare pathologies without training data as out-of-distribution (OOD) findings. We generate a novel dataset of pixelwise annotations of healthy tissue and known pathologies and use this data to fine-tune a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINOv2) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in order to do tissue segmentation. Finally, we extract features for OOD detection using the Mahalanobis distance. To better account for class-dependent variability in histological data, we propose the use of class-specific thresholds. We optimize the thresholds using the mean of the false negative and false positive rates, resulting in only 0.16\% of pathological tissue classified as healthy and 0.35\% of healthy tissue classified as pathological. Applied to mouse liver WSIs with known toxicological findings, the framework accurately detects anomalies, including rare OOD morphologies. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-driven histopathology to support preclinical workflows, reduce late-stage failures, and improve efficiency in drug development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Two-Stage Grid Optimization for Group-wise Quantization of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02126</link><description>arXiv:2602.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-wise quantization is an effective strategy for mitigating accuracy degradation in low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs). Among existing methods, GPTQ has been widely adopted due to its efficiency; however, it neglects input statistics and inter-group correlations when determining group scales, leading to a mismatch with its goal of minimizing layer-wise reconstruction loss. In this work, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for group scales that explicitly minimizes the layer-wise reconstruction loss. In the first stage, performed prior to GPTQ, we initialize each group scale to minimize the group-wise reconstruction loss, thereby incorporating input statistics. In the second stage, we freeze the integer weights obtained via GPTQ and refine the group scales to minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss. To this end, we employ the coordinate descent algorithm and derive a closed-form update rule, which enables efficient refinement without costly numerical optimization. Notably, our derivation incorporates the quantization errors from preceding layers to prevent error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently enhances group-wise quantization, achieving higher accuracy with negligible overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Spatio-Temporal SE(3) Diffusion for Long-Horizon Protein Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02128</link><description>arXiv:2602.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain the gold standard for studying protein dynamics, but their computational cost limits access to biologically relevant timescales. Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02128v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Eliminating Registration Bias in Synthetic CT Generation: A Physics-Based Simulation Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02130</link><description>arXiv:2602.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised synthetic CT generation from CBCT requires registered training pairs, yet perfect registration between separately acquired scans remains unattainable. This registration bias propagates into trained models and corrupts standard evaluation metrics. This may suggest that superior benchmark performance indicates better reproduction of registration artifacts rather than anatomical fidelity. We propose physics-based CBCT simulation to provide geometrically aligned training pairs by construction, combined with evaluation using geometric alignment metrics against input CBCT rather than biased ground truth. On two independent pelvic datasets, models trained on synthetic data achieved superior geometric alignment (Normalized Mutual Information: 0.31 vs 0.22) despite lower conventional intensity scores. Intensity metrics showed inverted correlations with clinical assessment for deformably registered data, while Normalized Mutual Information consistently predicted observer preference across registration methodologies (rho = 0.31, p &lt; 0.001). Clinical observers preferred synthetic-trained outputs in 87% of cases, demonstrating that geometric fidelity, not intensity agreement with biased ground truth, aligns with clinical requirements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Two-Stage Coded-Sliding Beam Training and QoS-Constrained Sum-Rate Maximization for SIM-Assisted Wireless Communications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02131</link><description>arXiv:2602.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for large-scale antenna communications.However, efficient channel state information acquisition and phase shift optimization remain critical challenges. In this paper, we develop a unified framework of low-complexity algorithms for SIM-assisted communication systems to address these issues. Specifically, we propose a generalized two-step codebook construction (TSCC) method that leverages two-dimensional angular-domain decoupling to transform planar array beamformer design into two independent one-dimensional linear array beamformer design problems, efficiently solved via the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm and our proposed majorization-minimization-based proximal distance (PDMM) algorithm. We further develop a two-stage coded-sliding beam training (TSCSBT) method for low-overhead and high-accuracy beam training, where error-correcting codes are embedded in the first-stage training to enhance robustness against noise, and sliding sampling is subsequently performed around the matched angular samples to improve angular resolution. The proposed framework is further extended to multi-path user channels. Finally, a variable decoupling-based block successive upper bound minimization (VD-BSUM) algorithm is proposed to directly solve the QoS-constrained sum-rate maximization problem through closed-form iterative updates with substantially reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving precise beam pattern realization, improved beam training accuracy and angular resolution, and enhanced sum-rate performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] There Is More to Refusal in Large Language Models than a Single Direction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02132</link><description>arXiv:2602.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work argues that refusal in large language models is mediated by a single activation-space direction, enabling effective steering and ablation. We show that this account is incomplete. Across eleven categories of refusal and non-compliance, including safety, incomplete or unsupported requests, anthropomorphization, and over-refusal, we find that these refusal behaviors correspond to geometrically distinct directions in activation space. Yet despite this diversity, linear steering along any refusal-related direction produces nearly identical refusal to over-refusal trade-offs, acting as a shared one-dimensional control knob. The primary effect of different directions is not whether the model refuses, but how it refuses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding the Reversal Curse Mitigation in Masked Diffusion Models through Attention and Training Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02133</link><description>arXiv:2602.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) suffer from the reversal curse: after learning that "$A$ is $B$", they often fail on the reverse query "$B$ is $A$". Masked diffusion-based language models (MDMs) exhibit this failure in a much weaker form, but the underlying reason has remained unclear. A common explanation attributes this mitigation to the any-order training objective. However, observing "[MASK] is $B$" during training does not necessarily teach the model to handle the reverse prompt "$B$ is [MASK]". We show that the mitigation arises from architectural structure and its interaction with training. In a one-layer Transformer encoder, weight sharing couples the two directions by making forward and reverse attention scores positively correlated. In the same setting, we further show that the corresponding gradients are aligned, so minimizing the forward loss also reduces the reverse loss. Experiments on both controlled toy tasks and large-scale diffusion language models support these mechanisms, explaining why MDMs partially overcome a failure mode that persists in strong ARMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Safety Tax via Distribution-Grounded Refinement in Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02136</link><description>arXiv:2602.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment incurs safety tax that perturbs a large reasoning model's (LRM) general reasoning ability. Existing datasets used for safety alignment for an LRM are usually constructed by distilling safety reasoning traces and answers from an external LRM or human labeler. However, such reasoning traces and answers exhibit a distributional gap with the target LRM that needs alignment, and we conjecture such distributional gap is the culprit leading to significant degradation of reasoning ability of the target LRM. Driven by this hypothesis, we propose a safety alignment dataset construction method, dubbed DGR. DGR transforms and refines an existing out-of-distributional safety reasoning dataset to be aligned with the target's LLM inner distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that i) DGR effectively mitigates the safety tax while maintaining safety performance across all baselines, i.e., achieving \textbf{+30.2\%} on DirectRefusal and \textbf{+21.2\%} on R1-ACT improvement in average reasoning accuracy compared to Vanilla SFT; ii) the degree of reasoning degradation correlates with the extent of distribution shift, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to preserving capabilities. Furthermore, we find that safety alignment in LRMs may primarily function as a mechanism to activate latent knowledge, as a mere \textbf{10} samples are sufficient for activating effective refusal behaviors. These findings not only emphasize the importance of distributional consistency but also provide insights into the activation mechanism of safety in reasoning models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02136v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DCoPilot: Generative AI-Empowered Policy Adaptation for Dynamic Data Center Operations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02137</link><description>arXiv:2602.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern data centers (DCs) hosting artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated devices operate at high power densities with rapidly varying workloads, making minute-level adaptation essential for safe and energy-efficient operation. However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02137v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CAM: A Causality-based Analysis Framework for Multi-Agent Code Generation Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02138</link><description>arXiv:2602.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success that Multi-Agent Code Generation Systems (MACGS) have achieved, the inherent complexity of multi-agent architectures produces substantial volumes of intermediate outputs. To date, the individual importance of these intermediate outputs to the system correctness remains opaque, which impedes targeted optimization of MACGS designs. To address this challenge, we propose CAM, the first \textbf{C}ausality-based \textbf{A}nalysis framework for \textbf{M}ACGS that systematically quantifies the contribution of different intermediate features for system correctness. By comprehensively categorizing intermediate outputs and systematically simulating realistic errors on intermediate features, we identify the important features for system correctness and aggregate their importance rankings.
  We conduct extensive empirical analysis on the identified importance rankings. Our analysis reveals intriguing findings: first, we uncover context-dependent features\textemdash features whose importance emerges mainly through interactions with other features, revealing that quality assurance for MACGS should incorporate cross-feature consistency checks; second, we reveal that hybrid backend MACGS with different backend LLMs assigned according to their relative strength achieves up to 7.2\% Pass@1 improvement, underscoring hybrid architectures as a promising direction for future MACGS design. We further demonstrate CAM's practical utility through two applications: (1) failure repair which achieves a 73.3\% success rate by optimizing top-3 importance-ranked features and (2) feature pruning that reduces up to 66.8\% intermediate token consumption while maintaining generation performance. Our work provides actionable insights for MACGS design and deployment, establishing causality analysis as a powerful approach for understanding and improving MACGS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02138v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantifying the Gap between Understanding and Generation within Unified Multimodal Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02140</link><description>arXiv:2602.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMM) have demonstrated remarkable progress in both understanding and generation tasks. However, whether these two capabilities are genuinely aligned and integrated within a single model remains unclear. To investigate this question, we introduce GapEval, a bidirectional benchmark designed to quantify the gap between understanding and generation capabilities, and quantitatively measure the cognitive coherence of the two "unified" directions. Each question can be answered in both modalities (image and text), enabling a symmetric evaluation of a model's bidirectional inference capability and cross-modal consistency. Experiments reveal a persistent gap between the two directions across a wide range of UMMs with different architectures, suggesting that current models achieve only surface-level unification rather than deep cognitive convergence of the two. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an empirical study from the perspective of knowledge manipulation to illustrate the underlying limitations. Our findings indicate that knowledge within UMMs often remains disjoint. The capability emergence and knowledge across modalities are unsynchronized, paving the way for further exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02140v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FD-VLA: Force-Distilled Vision-Language-Action Model for Contact-Rich Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02142</link><description>arXiv:2602.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Force sensing is a crucial modality for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, as it enables fine-grained perception and dexterous manipulation in contact-rich tasks. We present Force-Distilled VLA (FD-VLA), a novel framework that integrates force awareness into contact-rich manipulation without relying on physical force sensors. The core of our approach is a Force Distillation Module (FDM), which distills force by mapping a learnable query token, conditioned on visual observations and robot states, into a predicted force token aligned with the latent representation of actual force signals. During inference, this distilled force token is injected into the pretrained VLM, enabling force-aware reasoning while preserving the integrity of its vision-language semantics. This design provides two key benefits: first, it allows practical deployment across a wide range of robots that lack expensive or fragile force-torque sensors, thereby reducing hardware cost and complexity; second, the FDM introduces an additional force-vision-state fusion prior to the VLM, which improves cross-modal alignment and enhances perception-action robustness in contact-rich scenarios. Surprisingly, our physical experiments show that the distilled force token outperforms direct sensor force measurements as well as other baselines, which highlights the effectiveness of this force-distilled VLA approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Generative Selection for Best-of-N</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02143</link><description>arXiv:2602.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute via parallel sampling can substantially improve LLM reasoning, but is often limited by Best-of-N selection quality. Generative selection methods, such as GenSelect, address this bottleneck, yet strong selection performance remains largely limited to large models. We show that small reasoning models can acquire strong GenSelect capabilities through targeted reinforcement learning. To this end, we synthesize selection tasks from large-scale math and code instruction datasets by filtering to instances with both correct and incorrect candidate solutions, and train 1.7B-parameter models with DAPO to reward correct selections. Across math (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25) and code (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks, our models consistently outperform prompting and majority-voting baselines, often approaching or exceeding much larger models. Moreover, these gains generalize to selecting outputs from stronger models despite training only on outputs from weaker models. Overall, our results establish reinforcement learning as a scalable way to unlock strong generative selection in small models, enabling efficient test-time scaling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02143v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Back to the Future: Look-ahead Augmentation and Parallel Self-Refinement for Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02146</link><description>arXiv:2602.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) remains challenging due to the trade-off between parallel efficiency and sequential modeling of temporal coherence. Direct multi-step forecasting (DMS) methods enable fast, parallel prediction of all future horizons but often lose temporal consistency across steps, while iterative multi-step forecasting (IMS) preserves temporal dependencies at the cost of error accumulation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we propose Back to the Future (BTTF), a simple yet effective framework that enhances forecasting stability through look-ahead augmentation and self-corrective refinement. Rather than relying on complex model architectures, BTTF revisits the fundamental forecasting process and refines a base model by ensembling the second-stage models augmented with their initial predictions. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently improves long-horizon accuracy and mitigates the instability of linear forecasting models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 58% and demonstrating stable improvements even when the first-stage model is trained under suboptimal conditions. These results suggest that leveraging model-generated forecasts as augmentation can be a simple yet powerful way to enhance long-term prediction, even without complex architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HPE: Hallucinated Positive Entanglement for Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02147</link><description>arXiv:2602.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated self-supervised learning (FSSL) enables collaborative training of self-supervised representation models without sharing raw unlabeled data. While it serves as a crucial paradigm for privacy-preserving learning, its security remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious clients manipulate local training to inject targeted backdoors. Existing FSSL attack methods, however, often suffer from low utilization of poisoned samples, limited transferability, and weak persistence. To address these limitations, we propose a new backdoor attack method for FSSL, namely Hallucinated Positive Entanglement (HPE). HPE first employs hallucination-based augmentation using synthetic positive samples to enhance the encoder's embedding of backdoor features. It then introduces feature entanglement to enforce tight binding between triggers and backdoor samples in the representation space. Finally, selective parameter poisoning and proximity-aware updates constrain the poisoned model within the vicinity of the global model, enhancing its stability and persistence. Experimental results on several FSSL scenarios and datasets show that HPE significantly outperforms existing backdoor attack methods in performance and exhibits strong robustness under various defense mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02147v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ECHO: Entropy-Confidence Hybrid Optimization for Test-Time Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02150</link><description>arXiv:2602.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning generates multiple candidate answers via repeated rollouts and performs online updates using pseudo-labels constructed by majority voting. To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias. Experiments demonstrate that ECHO achieves consistent gains on multiple mathematical and visual reasoning benchmarks, and generalizes more effectively under a limited rollout budget.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Adaptive Rounding with Vectorized Reparameterization for LLM Quantization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02151</link><description>arXiv:2602.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Rounding has emerged as an alternative to round-to-nearest (RTN) for post-training quantization by enabling cross-element error cancellation. Yet, dense and element-wise rounding matrices are prohibitively expensive for billion-parameter large language models (LLMs). We revisit adaptive rounding from an efficiency perspective and propose VQRound, a parameter-efficient optimization framework that reparameterizes the rounding matrix into a compact codebook. Unlike low-rank alternatives, VQRound minimizes the element-wise worst-case error under $L_\infty$ norm, which is critical for handling heavy-tailed weight distributions in LLMs. Beyond reparameterization, we identify rounding initialization as a decisive factor and develop a lightweight end-to-end finetuning pipeline that optimizes codebooks across all layers using only 128 samples. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Qwen3 models demonstrate that VQRound achieves better convergence than traditional adaptive rounding at the same number of steps while using as little as 0.2% of the trainable parameters. Our results show that adaptive rounding can be made both scalable and fast-fitting.

Abstract: Prior to modern Earth observation technologies, historical maps provide a unique record of long-term urban transformation and offer a lens on the evolving identity of cities. However, extracting consistent and fine-grained change information from historical map series remains challenging due to spatial misalignment, cartographic variation, and degrading document quality, limiting most analyses to small-scale or qualitative approaches. We propose a fully automated, deep learning-based framework for fine-grained urban change analysis from large collections of historical maps, built on a modular design that integrates dense map alignment, multi-temporal object detection, and change profiling. This framework shifts the analysis of historical maps from ad hoc visual comparison toward systematic, quantitative characterization of urban change. Experiments demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed alignment and object detection methods. Applied to Paris between 1868 and 1937, the framework reveals the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in urban transformation, highlighting its relevance for research in the social sciences and humanities. The modular design of our framework further supports adaptation to diverse cartographic contexts and downstream applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02154v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LoopViT: Scaling Visual ARC with Looped Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02156</link><description>arXiv:2602.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in visual reasoning have leveraged vision transformers to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. However, we argue that the feed-forward architecture, where computational depth is strictly bound to parameter size, falls short of capturing the iterative, algorithmic nature of human induction. In this work, we propose a recursive architecture called Loop-ViT, which decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence. Loop-ViT iterates a weight-tied Hybrid Block, combining local convolutions and global attention, to form a latent chain of thought. Crucially, we introduce a parameter-free Dynamic Exit mechanism based on predictive entropy: the model halts inference when its internal state ``crystallizes" into a low-uncertainty attractor. Empirical results on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark validate this perspective: our 18M model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming massive 73M-parameter ensembles. These findings demonstrate that adaptive iterative computation offers a far more efficient scaling axis for visual reasoning than simply increasing network width.

Abstract: This project compares three graph search approaches for the task of traffic-aware navigation in Kingston's road network. These approaches include a single-run multi-query preprocessing algorithm (Floyd-Warshall-Ingerman), continuous single-query real-time search (Dijkstra's and A*), and an algorithm combining both approaches to balance between their trade-offs by first finding the top K shortest paths then iterating over them in real time (Yen's). Dijkstra's and A* resulted in the most traffic-aware optimal solutions with minimal preprocessing required. Floyd-Warshall-Ingerman was the fastest in real time but provided distance based paths with no traffic awareness. Yen's algorithm required significant preprocessing but balanced between the other two approaches in terms of runtime speed and optimality. Each approach presents advantages and disadvantages that need to be weighed depending on the circumstances of specific deployment contexts to select the best custom solution. *This project was completed as part of ELEC 844 (Search and Planning Algorithms for Robotics) in the Fall 2025 term.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02158v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Focus-dLLM: Accelerating Long-Context Diffusion LLM Inference via Confidence-Guided Context Focusing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02159</link><description>arXiv:2602.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) deliver strong long-context processing capability in a non-autoregressive decoding paradigm. However, the considerable computational cost of bidirectional full attention limits the inference efficiency. Although sparse attention is promising, existing methods remain ineffective. This stems from the need to estimate attention importance for tokens yet to be decoded, while the unmasked token positions are unknown during diffusion. In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions. Built upon this, we propose a sink-aware pruning strategy to accurately estimate and remove redundant attention computation, while preserving highly influential attention sinks. To further reduce overhead, this strategy reuses identified sink locations across layers, leveraging the observed cross-layer consistency. Experimental results show that our method offers more than $29\times$ lossless speedup under $32K$ context length.

Abstract: Effective tool use and reasoning are essential capabilities for large reasoning models~(LRMs) to address complex real-world problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that current LRMs lack the capability of sub-task decomposition in complex tool use scenarios, leading to Lazy Reasoning. To address this, we propose a two-stage training framework D-CORE~(\underline{\textbf{D}}ecomposing tasks and \underline{\textbf{Co}}mposing \underline{\textbf{Re}}asoning processes) that first incentivize the LRMs' task decomposition reasoning capability via self-distillation, followed by diversity-aware reinforcement learning~(RL) to restore LRMs' reflective reasoning capability. D-CORE achieves robust tool-use improvements across diverse benchmarks and model scales. Experiments on BFCLv3 demonstrate superiority of our method: D-CORE-8B reaches 77.7\% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing 8B model by 5.7\%. Meanwhile, D-CORE-14B establishes a new state-of-the-art at 79.3\%, outperforming 70B models despite being 5$\times$ smaller.

Abstract: Temporal link prediction (TLP) models are commonly evaluated based on predictive accuracy, yet such evaluations do not assess whether these models capture the causal mechanisms that govern temporal interactions. In this work, we propose a framework for counterfactual validation of TLP models by generating causal temporal interaction graphs (CTIGs) with known ground-truth causal structure. We first introduce a structural equation model for continuous-time event sequences that supports both excitatory and inhibitory effects, and then extend this mechanism to temporal interaction graphs. To compare causal models, we propose a distance metric based on cross-model predictive error, and empirically validate the hypothesis that predictors trained on one causal model degrade when evaluated on sufficiently distant models. Finally, we instantiate counterfactual evaluation under (i) controlled causal shifts between generating models and (ii) timestamp shuffling as a stochastic distortion with measurable causal distance. Our framework provides a foundation for causality-aware benchmarking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02161v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpretable Tabular Foundation Models via In-Context Kernel Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02162</link><description>arXiv:2602.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular foundation models like TabPFN and TabICL achieve state-of-the-art performance through in-context learning, yet their architectures remain fundamentally opaque. We introduce KernelICL, a framework to enhance tabular foundation models with quantifiable sample-based interpretability. Building on the insight that in-context learning is akin to kernel regression, we make this mechanism explicit by replacing the final prediction layer with kernel functions (Gaussian, dot-product, kNN) so that every prediction is a transparent weighted average of training labels. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy that formally unifies standard kernel methods, modern neighbor-based approaches, and attention mechanisms under a single framework, and quantify inspectability via the perplexity of the weight distribution over training samples. On 55 TALENT benchmark datasets, KernelICL achieves performance on par with existing tabular foundation models, demonstrating that explicit kernel constraints on the final layer enable inspectable predictions without sacrificing performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02162v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reg4Pru: Regularisation Through Random Token Routing for Token Pruning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02163</link><description>arXiv:2602.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers are widely adopted in modern vision models due to their strong ability to scale with dataset size and generalisability. However, this comes with a major drawback: computation scales quadratically to the total number of tokens. Numerous methods have been proposed to mitigate this. For example, we consider token pruning with reactivating tokens from preserved representations, but the increased computational efficiency of this method results in decreased stability from the preserved representations, leading to poorer dense prediction performance at deeper layers. In this work, we introduce Reg4Pru, a training regularisation technique that mitigates token-pruning performance loss for segmentation. We compare our models on the FIVES blood vessel segmentation dataset and find that Reg4Pru improves average precision by an absolute 46% compared to the same model trained without routing. This increase is observed using a configuration that achieves a 29% relative speedup in wall-clock time compared to the non-pruned baseline. These findings indicate that Reg4Pru is a valuable regulariser for token reduction strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02163v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Co-RedTeam: Orchestrated Security Discovery and Exploitation with LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02164</link><description>arXiv:2602.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting cybersecurity tasks, yet existing approaches struggle with automatic vulnerability discovery and exploitation due to limited interaction, weak execution grounding, and a lack of experience reuse. We propose Co-RedTeam, a security-aware multi-agent framework designed to mirror real-world red-teaming workflows by integrating security-domain knowledge, code-aware analysis, execution-grounded iterative reasoning, and long-term memory. Co-RedTeam decomposes vulnerability analysis into coordinated discovery and exploitation stages, enabling agents to plan, execute, validate, and refine actions based on real execution feedback while learning from prior trajectories. Extensive evaluations on challenging security benchmarks demonstrate that Co-RedTeam consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse backbone models, achieving over 60% success rate in vulnerability exploitation and over 10% absolute improvement in vulnerability detection. Ablation and iteration studies further confirm the critical role of execution feedback, structured interaction, and memory for building robust and generalizable cybersecurity agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02164v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Asymmetric L\'evy walks driven by convex combination of fractional material derivatives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02169</link><description>arXiv:2602.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a class of linear partial differential equations that arise as deterministic descriptions of the scaling limits of L\'evy walks, in which transport is driven by a convex combination of fractional material derivatives and a source term. Using techniques of Fourier-Laplace transforms, we first prove the existence of mild solutions for continuous initial data. Using a recently obtained pointwise representation of the fractional material derivative, we then identify a necessary and sufficient condition on the source term that guaranties the solution to remain a probability density for all times (non-negativity and unit mass). Motivated by the need to preserve these probabilistic properties in computations, we construct a finite-volume discretization that is probability conservative by construction. We establish discrete stability and a convergence result for the continuous weak solution as space and time steps tend to zero. Extensive numerical experiments validate the scheme: total mass is conserved, non-negativity is maintained, and the computed solutions reproduce the known analytic representations of the probability density functions associated with the L\'evy walk process. The combined theoretical and numerical framework provides a reliable tool for studying anomalous transport governed by fractional dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Evolving Coordination Protocol in Multi-Agent AI Systems: An Exploratory Systems Feasibility Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02170</link><description>arXiv:2602.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems increasingly rely on internal coordination mechanisms to combine, arbitrate, or constrain the outputs of heterogeneous components. In safety-critical and regulated domains such as finance, these mechanisms must satisfy strict formal requirements, remain auditable, and operate within explicitly bounded limits. Coordination logic therefore functions as a governance layer rather than an optimization heuristic.
  This paper presents an exploratory systems feasibility study of Self-Evolving Coordination Protocols (SECP): coordination protocols that permit limited, externally validated self-modification while preserving fixed formal invariants. We study a controlled proof-of-concept setting in which six fixed Byzantine consensus protocol proposals are evaluated by six specialized decision modules. All coordination regimes operate under identical hard constraints, including Byzantine fault tolerance (f &lt; n/3), O(n2) message complexity, complete non-statistical safety and liveness arguments, and bounded explainability.
  Four coordination regimes are compared in a single-shot design: unanimous hard veto, weighted scalar aggregation, SECP v1.0 (an agent-designed non-scalar protocol), and SECP v2.0 (the result of one governed modification). Outcomes are evaluated using a single metric, proposal coverage, defined as the number of proposals accepted. A single recursive modification increased coverage from two to three accepted proposals while preserving all declared invariants.
  The study makes no claims regarding statistical significance, optimality, convergence, or learning. Its contribution is architectural: it demonstrates that bounded self-modification of coordination protocols is technically implementable, auditable, and analyzable under explicit formal constraints, establishing a foundation for governed multi-agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lung Nodule Image Synthesis Driven by Two-Stage Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02171</link><description>arXiv:2602.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited sample size and insufficient diversity of lung nodule CT datasets severely restrict the performance and generalization ability of detection models. Existing methods generate images with insufficient diversity and controllability, suffering from issues such as monotonous texture features and distorted anatomical structures. Therefore, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network (TSGAN) to enhance the diversity and spatial controllability of synthetic data by decoupling the morphological structure and texture features of lung nodules. In the first stage, StyleGAN is used to generate semantic segmentation mask images, encoding lung nodules and tissue backgrounds to control the anatomical structure of lung nodule images; The second stage uses the DL-Pix2Pix model to translate the mask map into CT images, employing local importance attention to capture local features, while utilizing dynamic weight multi-head window attention to enhance the modeling capability of lung nodule texture and background. Compared to the original dataset, the accuracy improved by 4.6% and mAP by 4% on the LUNA16 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that TSGAN can enhance the quality of synthetic images and the performance of detection models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02171v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalized Optimal Classification Trees: A Mixed-Integer Programming Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02173</link><description>arXiv:2602.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global optimization of decision trees is a long-standing challenge in combinatorial optimization, yet such models play an important role in interpretable machine learning. Although the problem has been investigated for several decades, only recent advances in discrete optimization have enabled practical algorithms for solving optimal classification tree problems on real-world datasets. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) offers a high degree of modeling flexibility, and we therefore propose a MIP-based framework for learning optimal classification trees under nonlinear performance metrics, such as the F1-score, that explicitly addresses class imbalance. To improve scalability, we develop problem-specific acceleration techniques, including a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm, an instance-reduction scheme, and warm-start strategies. We evaluate the proposed approach on 50 benchmark datasets. The computational results show that the framework can efficiently optimize nonlinear metrics while achieving strong predictive performance and reduced solution times compared with existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02173v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CIEC: Coupling Implicit and Explicit Cues for Multimodal Weakly Supervised Manipulation Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02175</link><description>arXiv:2602.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the threat of misinformation, multimodal manipulation localization has garnered growing attention. Consider that current methods rely on costly and time-consuming fine-grained annotations, such as patch/token-level annotations. This paper proposes a novel framework named Coupling Implicit and Explicit Cues (CIEC), which aims to achieve multimodal weakly-supervised manipulation localization for image-text pairs utilizing only coarse-grained image/sentence-level annotations. It comprises two branches, image-based and text-based weakly-supervised localization. For the former, we devise the Textual-guidance Refine Patch Selection (TRPS) module. It integrates forgery cues from both visual and textual perspectives to lock onto suspicious regions aided by spatial priors. Followed by the background silencing and spatial contrast constraints to suppress interference from irrelevant areas. For the latter, we devise the Visual-deviation Calibrated Token Grounding (VCTG) module. It focuses on meaningful content words and leverages relative visual bias to assist token localization. Followed by the asymmetric sparse and semantic consistency constraints to mitigate label noise and ensure reliability.

However, preference alignment of DLLMs remains challenging due to high variance introduced by Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)-based likelihood estimation. In this work, we propose AR-MAP, a novel transfer learning framework that leverages preference-aligned autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) as implicit teachers for DLLM alignment. We reveal that DLLMs can effectively absorb alignment knowledge from AR-LLMs through simple weight scaling, exploiting the shared architectural structure between these divergent generation paradigms. Crucially, our approach circumvents the high variance and computational overhead of direct DLLM alignment and comprehensive experiments across diverse preference alignment tasks demonstrate that AR-MAP achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing DLLM-specific alignment methods, achieving 69.08\% average score across all tasks and models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is critical for clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation in modern healthcare. While classical survival models such as Cox remain widely adopted in standard practice, they rely on restrictive assumptions, including linear covariate relationships and proportional hazards over time, that often fail to capture real-world clinical dynamics. Recent deep learning approaches like DeepSurv and DeepHit offer improved expressivity but sacrifice interpretability, limiting clinical adoption where trust and transparency are paramount. Hybrid models incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), such as CoxKAN, have begun to address this trade-off but remain constrained by the semi-parametric Cox framework. In this work we introduce SurvKAN, a fully parametric, time-continuous survival model based on KAN architectures that eliminates the proportional hazards constraint. SurvKAN treats time as an explicit input to a KAN that directly predicts the log-hazard function, enabling end-to-end training on the full survival likelihood. Our architecture preserves interpretability through learnable univariate functions that indicate how individual features influence risk over time. Extensive experiments on standard survival benchmarks demonstrate that SurvKAN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to classical and state-of-the-art baselines across concordance and calibration metrics. Additionally, interpretability analyses reveal clinically meaningful patterns that align with medical domain knowledge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STILL: Selecting Tokens for Intra-Layer Hybrid Attention to Linearize LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02180</link><description>arXiv:2602.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearizing pretrained large language models (LLMs) primarily relies on intra-layer hybrid attention mechanisms to alleviate the quadratic complexity of standard softmax attention. Existing methods perform token routing based on sliding-window partitions, resulting in position-based selection and fails to capture token-specific global importance. Meanwhile, linear attention further suffers from distribution shift caused by learnable feature maps that distort pretrained feature magnitudes. Motivated by these limitations, we propose STILL, an intra-layer hybrid linearization framework for efficiently linearizing LLMs. STILL introduces a Self-Saliency Score with strong local-global consistency, enabling accurate token selection using sliding-window computation, and retains salient tokens for sparse softmax attention while summarizing the remaining context via linear attention. To preserve pretrained representations, we design a Norm-Preserved Feature Map (NP-Map) that decouples feature direction from magnitude and reinjects pretrained norms. We further adopt a unified training-inference architecture with chunk-wise parallelization and delayed selection to improve hardware efficiency. Experiments show that STILL matches or surpasses the original pretrained model on commonsense and general reasoning tasks, and achieves up to a 86.2% relative improvement over prior linearized attention methods on long-context benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02180v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Extending the Law of Intersegmental Coordination: Implications for Powered Prosthetic Controls</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02181</link><description>arXiv:2602.02181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powered prostheses are capable of providing net positive work to amputees and have advanced in the past two decades. However, reducing amputee metabolic cost of walking remains an open problem. The Law of Intersegmental Coordination (ISC) has been observed across gaits and has been previously implicated in energy expenditure of walking, yet it has rarely been analyzed or applied within the context of lower-limb amputee gait. This law states that the elevation angles of the thigh, shank and foot over the gait cycle are not independent. In this work, we developed a method to analyze intersegmental coordination for lower-limb 3D kinematic data, to simplify ISC analysis. Moreover, inspired by motor control, biomechanics and robotics literature, we used our method to broaden ISC toward a new law of coordination of moments. We find these Elevation Space Moments (ESM), and present results showing a moment-based coordination for able bodied gait. We also analyzed ISC for amputee gait walking with powered and passive prosthesis, and found that while elevation angles remained planar, the ESM showed less coordination. We use ISC as a constraint to predict the shank angles/moments that would compensate for alterations due to a passive foot so as to mimic a healthy thigh angle/moment profile. This may have implications for improving powered prosthetic control. We developed the ISC3d toolbox that is freely available online, which may be used to compute kinematic and kinetic ISC in 3D. This provides a means to further study the role of coordination in gait and may help address fundamental questions of the neural control of human movement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Metalinguistic Knowledge in Large Language Models across the World's Languages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02182</link><description>arXiv:2602.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated on language use tasks, yet their knowledge of linguistic structure remains poorly understood. Existing linguistic benchmarks typically focus on narrow phenomena, emphasize high-resource languages, and rarely evaluate metalinguistic knowledge-explicit reasoning about language structure rather than language use. Using accuracy and macro F1, together with majority-class and chance baselines, we analyse overall performance and examine variation by linguistic domains and language-related factors. Our results show that metalinguistic knowledge in current LLMs is limited: GPT-4o performs best but achieves only moderate accuracy (0.367), while open-source models lag behind. All models perform above chance but fail to outperform the majority-class baseline, suggesting they capture cross-linguistic patterns but lack fine-grained grammatical distinctions. Performance varies across linguistic domains, with lexical features showing the highest accuracy and phonological features among the lowest, partially reflecting differences in online visibility. At the language level, accuracy shows a strong association with digital language status: languages with higher digital presence and resource availability are evaluated more accurately, while low-resource languages show substantially lower performance. Analyses of predictive factors confirm that resource-related indicators (Wikipedia size, corpus availability) are more informative predictors of accuracy than geographical, genealogical, or sociolinguistic factors. Together, these results suggest that LLMs' metalinguistic knowledge is fragmented and shaped by data availability rather than generalizable grammatical competence across the world's languages. We release our benchmark as an open-source dataset to support systematic evaluation and encourage greater global linguistic diversity in future LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02182v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Malware Detection Through Memory Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02184</link><description>arXiv:2602.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper summarizes the research conducted for a malware detection project using the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity's MalMemAnalysis-2022 dataset. The purpose of the project was to explore the effectiveness and efficiency of machine learning techniques for the task of binary classification (i.e., benign or malicious) as well as multi-class classification to further include three malware sub-types (i.e., benign, ransomware, spyware, or Trojan horse). The XGBoost model type was the final model selected for both tasks due to the trade-off between strong detection capability and fast inference speed. The binary classifier achieved a testing subset accuracy and F1 score of 99.98\%, while the multi-class version reached an accuracy of 87.54\% and an F1 score of 81.26\%, with an average F1 score over the malware sub-types of 75.03\%. In addition to the high modelling performance, XGBoost is also efficient in terms of classification speed. It takes about 37.3 milliseconds to classify 50 samples in sequential order in the binary setting and about 43.2 milliseconds in the multi-class setting. The results from this research project help advance the efforts made towards developing accurate and real-time obfuscated malware detectors for the goal of improving online privacy and safety. *This project was completed as part of ELEC 877 (AI for Cybersecurity) in the Winter 2024 term.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02184v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision-DeepResearch Benchmark: Rethinking Visual and Textual Search for Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02185</link><description>arXiv:2602.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced VQA and now support Vision-DeepResearch systems that use search engines for complex visual-textual fact-finding. However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow. This strategy is shown to effectively improve model performance in realistic visual retrieval scenarios. Overall, our results provide practical guidance for the design of future multimodal deep-research systems. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Topology-Aware Implicit Field for Unified Pulmonary Tree Modeling with Incomplete Topological Supervision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02186</link><description>arXiv:2602.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulmonary trees extracted from CT images frequently exhibit topological incompleteness, such as missing or disconnected branches, which substantially degrades downstream anatomical analysis and limits the applicability of existing pulmonary tree modeling pipelines. Current approaches typically rely on dense volumetric processing or explicit graph reasoning, leading to limited efficiency and reduced robustness under realistic structural corruption. We propose TopoField, a topology-aware implicit modeling framework that treats topology repair as a first-class modeling problem and enables unified multi-task inference for pulmonary tree analysis. TopoField represents pulmonary anatomy using sparse surface and skeleton point clouds and learns a continuous implicit field that supports topology repair without relying on complete or explicit disconnection annotations, by training on synthetically introduced structural disruptions over \textit{already} incomplete trees. Building upon the repaired implicit representation, anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction are jointly inferred through task-specific implicit functions within a single forward pass.Extensive experiments on the Lung3D+ dataset demonstrate that TopoField consistently improves topological completeness and achieves accurate anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction under challenging incomplete scenarios. Owing to its implicit formulation, TopoField attains high computational efficiency, completing all tasks in just over one second per case, highlighting its practicality for large-scale and time-sensitive clinical applications. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/HINTLab/TopoField.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning in a Combinatorial and Constrained World: Benchmarking LLMs on Natural-Language Combinatorial Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02188</link><description>arXiv:2602.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in math and logic reasoning, their ability to handle combinatorial optimization (CO) -- searching high-dimensional solution spaces under hard constraints -- remains underexplored. To bridge the gap, we introduce NLCO, a \textbf{N}atural \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}ombinatorial \textbf{O}ptimization benchmark that evaluates LLMs on end-to-end CO reasoning: given a language-described decision-making scenario, the model must output a discrete solution without writing code or calling external solvers. NLCO covers 43 CO problems and is organized using a four-layer taxonomy of variable types, constraint families, global patterns, and objective classes, enabling fine-grained evaluation. We provide solver-annotated solutions and comprehensively evaluate LLMs by feasibility, solution optimality, and reasoning efficiency. Experiments across a wide range of modern LLMs show that high-performing models achieve strong feasibility and solution quality on small instances, but both degrade as instance size grows, even if more tokens are used for reasoning. We also observe systematic effects across the taxonomy: set-based tasks are relatively easy, whereas graph-structured problems and bottleneck objectives lead to more frequent failures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02188v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ECHO-2: A Large Scale Distributed Rollout Framework for Cost-efficient Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02192</link><description>arXiv:2602.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical stage in post-training large language models (LLMs), involving repeated interaction between rollout generation, reward evaluation, and centralized learning. Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02192v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SSI-DM: Singularity Skipping Inversion of Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02193</link><description>arXiv:2602.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverting real images into the noise space is essential for editing tasks using diffusion models, yet existing methods produce non-Gaussian noise with poor editability due to the inaccuracy in early noising steps. We identify the root cause: a mathematical singularity that renders inversion fundamentally ill-posed. We propose Singularity Skipping Inversion of Diffusion Models (SSI-DM), which bypasses this singular region by adding small noise before standard inversion. This simple approach produces inverted noise with natural Gaussian properties while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. As a plug-and-play technique compatible with general diffusion models, our method achieves superior performance on public image datasets for reconstruction and interpolation tasks, providing a principled and efficient solution to diffusion model inversion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02193v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] State Rank Dynamics in Linear Attention LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02195</link><description>arXiv:2602.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Attention Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling recurrent formulation that compresses context into a fixed-size state matrix, enabling constant-time inference. However, the internal dynamics of this compressed state remain largely opaque. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the runtime state dynamics of state-of-the-art Linear Attention models. We uncover a fundamental phenomenon termed State Rank Stratification, characterized by a distinct spectral bifurcation among linear attention heads: while one group maintains an effective rank oscillating near zero, the other exhibits rapid growth that converges to an upper bound. Extensive experiments across diverse inference contexts reveal that these dynamics remain strikingly consistent, indicating that the identity of a head,whether low-rank or high-rank,is an intrinsic structural property acquired during pre-training, rather than a transient state dependent on the input data. Furthermore, our diagnostic probes reveal a surprising functional divergence: low-rank heads are indispensable for model reasoning, whereas high-rank heads exhibit significant redundancy. Leveraging this insight, we propose Joint Rank-Norm Pruning, a zero-shot strategy that achieves a 38.9\% reduction in KV-cache overhead while largely maintaining model accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TIDE: Trajectory-based Diagnostic Evaluation of Test-Time Improvement in LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02196</link><description>arXiv:2602.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous LLM agents demonstrate their ability to improve performance through iterative interaction with the environment. We define this paradigm as Test-Time Improvement (TTI). However, the mechanisms under how and why TTI succeed or fail remain poorly understood, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture their task optimization efficiency, behavior adaptation after erroneous actions, and the specific utility of working memory for task completion. To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction for KV Cache Management in Multimodal Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02197</link><description>arXiv:2602.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of visual information into Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but the quadratic memory and computational costs of Transformer architectures remain a bottleneck. Existing KV cache eviction strategies fail to address the heterogeneous attention distributions between visual and text tokens, leading to suboptimal efficiency or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction (HAE), a KV cache eviction framework that optimizes text-visual token interaction in MLLMs by implementing Dual-Attention Pruning during pre-filling (leveraging visual token sparsity and attention variance) and a Dynamic Decoding Eviction Strategy (inspired by OS Recycle Bins) during decoding. HAE minimizes KV cache usage across layers, reduces computational overhead via index broadcasting, and theoretically ensures superior information integrity and lower error bounds compared to greedy strategies, enhancing efficiency in both comprehension and generation tasks. Empirically, HAE reduces KV-Cache memory by 41\% with minimal accuracy loss (0.3\% drop) in image understanding tasks and accelerates story generation inference by 1.5x while maintaining output quality on Phi3.5-Vision-Instruct model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02197v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] More Than a Quick Glance: Overcoming the Greedy Bias in KV-Cache Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02199</link><description>arXiv:2602.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can theoretically support extensive context windows, their actual deployment is constrained by the linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache memory. Prevailing compression strategies mitigate this through various pruning mechanisms, yet trade-off semantic recall for memory efficiency. In this work, we present LASER-KV (Layer Accumulated Selection with Exact-LSH Recall), a framework designed to test the limits of KV compression under a strict accumulative budgeting policy. We deviate from the standard fixed summary size approach by implementing a block-wise accumulation strategy governed by a protection divisor (n). This allows us to isolate the effects of compression from sliding window artifacts. Our experiments on the Babilong benchmark reveal performance degradation in previous compression methods by 15-30% on various long context tasks. LASER-KV maintains stable performance, achieving superior accuracies by a margin of upto 10% at 128k. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that attention scores alone are a sufficient proxy for token utility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02199v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cardinality-Preserving Structured Sparse Graph Transformers for Molecular Property Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02201</link><description>arXiv:2602.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery motivates efficient molecular property prediction under limited labeled data. Chemical space is vast, often estimated at approximately 10^60 drug-like molecules, while only thousands of drugs have been approved. As a result, self-supervised pretraining on large unlabeled molecular corpora has become essential for data-efficient molecular representation learning. We introduce **CardinalGraphFormer**, a graph transformer that incorporates Graphormer-inspired structural biases, including shortest-path distance and centrality, as well as direct-bond edge bias, within a structured sparse attention regime limited to shortest-path distance &lt;= 3. The model further augments this design with a cardinality-preserving unnormalized aggregation channel over the same support set. Pretraining combines contrastive graph-level alignment with masked attribute reconstruction. Under a fully matched evaluation protocol, CardinalGraphFormer improves mean performance across all 11 evaluated tasks and achieves statistically significant gains on 10 of 11 public benchmarks spanning MoleculeNet, OGB, and TDC ADMET tasks when compared to strong reproduced baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02201v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] vLLM-Omni: Fully Disaggregated Serving for Any-to-Any Multimodal Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204</link><description>arXiv:2602.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: The effectiveness of LLM-based agents is often limited not by model capacity alone, but by how efficiently contextual information is utilized at runtime. Existing agent frameworks rely on rigid, syntax-heavy state representations such as nested JSON, which require models to devote a substantial portion of their limited attention to syntactic processing rather than semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose Fat-Cat, a document-driven agent architecture that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of state management. By integrating three key components: (1) a Semantic File System that represents agent state as Markdown documents aligned with common pre-training corpora, (2) a Textual Strategy Evolution module that accumulates task-solving knowledge without parameter updates, and (3) a Closed-Loop Watcher that monitors reasoning trajectories to reduce hallucinations. Extensive reasoning, retrieval, and coding benchmarks, Fat-Cat consistently improves agent performance. It enables the Kimi-k2 model to outperform the proprietary GPT-4o baseline on HotPotQA. Replacing the document-based state with JSON leads to performance drop, while empirically validating the critical necessity of document-driven state modeling over rigid syntax.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for knowledge-intensive domains, yet their use in agriculture is constrained by weak grounding, English-centric training data, and limited real-world evaluation. These issues are amplified for low-resource languages, where high-quality domain documentation exists but remains difficult to access through general-purpose models. This paper presents AgriHubi, a domain-adapted retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for Finnish-language agricultural decision support. AgriHubi integrates Finnish agricultural documents with open PORO family models and combines explicit source grounding with user feedback to support iterative refinement. Developed over eight iterations and evaluated through two user studies, the system shows clear gains in answer completeness, linguistic accuracy, and perceived reliability.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Visual-Language-Action (VLA), in highly complex and dynamic environments that involve real-time unpredictable interactions (such as 3D open worlds and large-scale PvP games), existing approaches remain inefficient at extracting action-critical signals from redundant sensor streams. To tackle this, we introduce MAIN-VLA, a framework that explicitly Models the Abstraction of Intention and eNvironment to ground decision-making in deep semantic alignment rather than superficial pattern matching. Specifically, our Intention Abstraction (IA) extracts verbose linguistic instructions and their associated reasoning into compact, explicit semantic primitives, while the Environment Semantics Abstraction (ESA) projects overwhelming visual streams into a structured, topological affordance representation. Furthermore, aligning these two abstract modalities induces an emergent attention-concentration effect, enabling a parameter-free token-pruning strategy that filters out perceptual redundancy without degrading performance. Extensive experiments in open-world Minecraft and large-scale PvP environments (Game for Peace and Valorant) demonstrate that MAIN-VLA sets a new state-of-the-art, which achieves superior decision quality, stronger generalization, and cutting-edge inference efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02212v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generating Physically Sound Designs from Text and a Set of Physical Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02213</link><description>arXiv:2602.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TIDES, a text informed design approach for generating physically sound designs based on a textual description and a set of physical constraints. TIDES jointly optimizes structural (topology) and visual properties. A pre-trained text-image model is used to measure the design's visual alignment with a text prompt and a differentiable physics simulator is used to measure its physical performance. We evaluate TIDES on a series of structural optimization problems operating under different load and support conditions, at different resolutions, and experimentally in the lab by performing the 3-point bending test on 2D beam designs that are extruded and 3D printed. We find that it can jointly optimize the two objectives and return designs that satisfy engineering design requirements (compliance and density) while utilizing features specified by text.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02213v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Forcing: Autoregressive Diffusion Distillation Done Right for High-Quality Real-Time Interactive Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02214</link><description>arXiv:2602.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve real-time interactive video generation, current methods distill pretrained bidirectional video diffusion models into few-step autoregressive (AR) models, facing an architectural gap when full attention is replaced by causal attention. However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires frame-level injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to a unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from a bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teacher's flow map and instead inducing a conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3\% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7\% in VisionReward, and 16.7\% in Instruction Following.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) offers a growing number of algorithms that aim to answer specific questions about black-box models. What is missing is a principled way to consolidate explanatory information about a fixed black-box model into a persistent, auditable artefact, that accompanies the black-box throughout its life cycle. We address this gap by introducing the notion of a scientific theory of a black (SToBB). Grounded in Constructive Empiricism, a SToBB fulfils three obligations: (i) empirical adequacy with respect to all available observations of black-box behaviour, (ii) adaptability via explicit update commitments that restore adequacy when new observations arrive, and (iii) auditability through transparent documentation of assumptions, construction choices, and update behaviour. We operationalise these obligations as a general framework that specifies an extensible observation base, a traceable hypothesis class, algorithmic components for construction and revision, and documentation sufficient for third-party assessment. Explanations for concrete stakeholder needs are then obtained by querying the maintained record through interfaces, rather than by producing isolated method outputs. As a proof of concept, we instantiate a complete SToBB for a neural-network classifier on a tabular task and introduce the Constructive Box Theoriser (CoBoT) algorithm, an online procedure that constructs and maintains an empirically adequate rule-based surrogate as observations accumulate. Together, these contributions position SToBBs as a life cycle-scale, inspectable point of reference that supports consistent, reusable analyses and systematic external scrutiny.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories in simplicial type theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02218</link><description>arXiv:2602.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory (STT) was introduced by Riehl and Shulman to leverage homotopy type theory to prove results about $(\infty,1)$-categories. Initial work on simplicial type theory focused on "formal" arguments in higher category theory and, in particular, no non-trivial examples of $\infty$-category theory were constructible within STT. More recent work has changed this state of affairs by applying techniques developed initial for cubical type theory to construct the $\infty$-category of spaces. We complete this process by constructing the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories, recovering one of the main foundational results of $\infty$-category theory (straightening--unstraightening) purely type-theoretically. We also show how this construction enables new examples of the directed version of the structure identity principle, the structure homomorphism principle.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02218v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Am I More Pointwise or Pairwise?

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to evaluate the quality of text, a field commonly referred to as LLM-as-a-judge. While prior works mainly focus on point-wise and pair-wise evaluation paradigms. Rubric-based evaluation, where LLMs select a score from multiple rubrics, has received less analysis. In this work, we show that rubric-based evaluation implicitly resembles a multi-choice setting and therefore has position bias: LLMs prefer score options appearing at specific positions in the rubric list. Through controlled experiments across multiple models and datasets, we demonstrate consistent position bias. To mitigate this bias, we propose a balanced permutation strategy that evenly distributes each score option across positions. We show that aggregating scores across balanced permutations not only reveals latent position bias, but also improves correlation between the LLM-as-a-Judge and human. Our results suggest that rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge is not inherently point-wise and that simple permutation-based calibration can substantially improve its reliability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Using Correspondence Patterns to Identify Irregular Words in Cognate sets Through Leave-One-Out Validation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02221</link><description>arXiv:2602.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular sound correspondences constitute the principal evidence in historical language comparison. Despite the heuristic focus on regularity, it is often more an intuitive judgement than a quantified evaluation, and irregularity is more common than expected from the Neogrammarian model. Given the recent progress of computational methods in historical linguistics and the increased availability of standardized lexical data, we are now able to improve our workflows and provide such a quantitative evaluation. Here, we present the balanced average recurrence of correspondence patterns as a new measure of regularity. We also present a new computational method that uses this measure to identify cognate sets that lack regularity with respect to their correspondence patterns. We validate the method through two experiments, using simulated and real data. In the experiments, we employ leave-one-out validation to measure the regularity of cognate sets in which one word form has been replaced by an irregular one, checking how well our method identifies the forms causing the irregularity. Our method achieves an overall accuracy of 85\% with the datasets based on real data. We also show the benefits of working with subsamples of large datasets and how increasing irregularity in the data influences our results. Reflecting on the broader potential of our new regularity measure and the irregular cognate identification method based on it, we conclude that they could play an important role in improving the quality of existing and future datasets in computer-assisted language comparison.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02221v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MIRROR: Manifold Ideal Reference ReconstructOR for Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02222</link><description>arXiv:2602.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity generative models have narrowed the perceptual gap between synthetic and real images, posing serious threats to media security. Most existing AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors rely on artifact-based classification and struggle to generalize to evolving generative traces. In contrast, human judgment relies on stable real-world regularities, with deviations from the human cognitive manifold serving as a more generalizable signal of forgery. Motivated by this insight, we reformulate AIGI detection as a Reference-Comparison problem that verifies consistency with the real-image manifold rather than fitting specific forgery cues. We propose MIRROR (Manifold Ideal Reference ReconstructOR), a framework that explicitly encodes reality priors using a learnable discrete memory bank. MIRROR projects an input into a manifold-consistent ideal reference via sparse linear combination, and uses the resulting residuals as robust detection signals. To evaluate whether detectors reach the "superhuman crossover" required to replace human experts, we introduce the Human-AIGI benchmark, featuring a psychophysically curated human-imperceptible subset. Across 14 benchmarks, MIRROR consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving gains of 2.1% on six standard benchmarks and 8.1% on seven in-the-wild benchmarks. On Human-AIGI, MIRROR reaches 89.6% accuracy across 27 generators, surpassing both lay users and visual experts, and further approaching the human perceptual limit as pretrained backbones scale.

Abstract: Optical character recognition (OCR), which converts printed or handwritten text into machine-readable form, is widely used in assistive technology for people with blindness and low vision. Yet, most evaluations rely on static datasets that do not reflect the challenges of mobile use. In this study, we systematically evaluated OCR performance under both static and dynamic conditions. Static tests measured detection range across distances of 1-7 meters and viewing angles of 0-75 degrees horizontally. Dynamic tests examined the impact of motion by varying walking speed from slow (0.8 m/s) to very fast (1.8 m/s) and comparing three camera mounting positions: head-mounted, shoulder-mounted, and hand-held. We evaluated both a smartphone and smart glasses, using the phone's main and ultra-wide cameras. Four OCR engines were benchmarked to assess accuracy at different distances and viewing angles: Google Vision, PaddleOCR 3.0, EasyOCR, and Tesseract. PaddleOCR 3.0 was then used to evaluate accuracy at different walking speeds. Accuracy was computed at the character level using the Levenshtein ratio against manually defined ground truth. Results showed that recognition accuracy declined with increased walking speed and wider viewing angles. Google Vision achieved the highest overall accuracy, with PaddleOCR close behind as the strongest open-source alternative. Across devices, the phone's main camera achieved the highest accuracy, and a shoulder-mounted placement yielded the highest average among body positions; however, differences among shoulder, head, and hand were not statistically significant.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02223v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Superposition: A Theory of Feature Geometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02224</link><description>arXiv:2602.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks represent more features than they have dimensions via superposition, forcing features to share representational space. Current methods decompose activations into sparse linear features but discard geometric structure. We develop a theory for studying the geometric structre of features by analyzing the spectra (eigenvalues, eigenspaces, etc.) of weight derived matrices. In particular, we introduce the frame operator $F = WW^\top$, which gives us a spectral measure that describes how each feature allocates norm across eigenspaces. While previous tools could describe the pairwise interactions between features, spectral methods capture the global geometry (``how do all features interact?''). In toy models of superposition, we use this theory to prove that capacity saturation forces spectral localization: features collapse onto single eigenspaces, organize into tight frames, and admit discrete classification via association schemes, classifying all geometries from prior work (simplices, polygons, antiprisms). The spectral measure formalism applies to arbitrary weight matrices, enabling diagnosis of feature localization beyond toy settings. These results point toward a broader program: applying operator theory to interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Show, Don't Tell: Morphing Latent Reasoning into Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02227</link><description>arXiv:2602.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress, yet existing methods often lack the ability to dynamically reason and refine during generation--a hallmark of human creativity. Current reasoning-augmented paradigms most rely on explicit thought processes, where intermediate reasoning is decoded into discrete text at fixed steps with frequent image decoding and re-encoding, leading to inefficiencies, information loss, and cognitive mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce LatentMorph, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates implicit latent reasoning into the T2I generation process. At its core, LatentMorph introduces four lightweight components: (i) a condenser for summarizing intermediate generation states into compact visual memory, (ii) a translator for converting latent thoughts into actionable guidance, (iii) a shaper for dynamically steering next image token predictions, and (iv) an RL-trained invoker for adaptively determining when to invoke reasoning. By performing reasoning entirely in continuous latent spaces, LatentMorph avoids the bottlenecks of explicit reasoning and enables more adaptive self-refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentMorph (I) enhances the base model Janus-Pro by $16\%$ on GenEval and $25\%$ on T2I-CompBench; (II) outperforms explicit paradigms (e.g., TwiG) by $15\%$ and $11\%$ on abstract reasoning tasks like WISE and IPV-Txt, (III) while reducing inference time by $44\%$ and token consumption by $51\%$; and (IV) exhibits $71\%$ cognitive alignment with human intuition on reasoning invocation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prediction-Powered Risk Monitoring of Deployed Models for Detecting Harmful Distribution Shifts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02229</link><description>arXiv:2602.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of monitoring model performance in dynamic environments where labeled data are limited. To this end, we propose prediction-powered risk monitoring (PPRM), a semi-supervised risk-monitoring approach based on prediction-powered inference (PPI). PPRM constructs anytime-valid lower bounds on the running risk by combining synthetic labels with a small set of true labels. Harmful shifts are detected via a threshold-based comparison with an upper bound on the nominal risk, satisfying assumption-free finite-sample guarantees in the probability of false alarm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PPRM through extensive experiments on image classification, large language model (LLM), and telecommunications monitoring tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02229v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SEDformer: Event-Synchronous Spiking Transformers for Irregular Telemetry Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02230</link><description>arXiv:2602.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telemetry streams from large-scale Internet-connected systems (e.g., IoT deployments and online platforms) naturally form an irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) whose accurate forecasting is operationally vital. A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features. Experiments on public telemetry IMTS datasets show that SEDformer attains state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while reducing energy and memory usage, providing a natural and efficient path for modeling IMTS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LiFlow: Flow Matching for 3D LiDAR Scene Completion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02232</link><description>arXiv:2602.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous driving scenarios, the collected LiDAR point clouds can be challenged by occlusion and long-range sparsity, limiting the perception of autonomous driving systems. Scene completion methods can infer the missing parts of incomplete 3D LiDAR scenes. Recent methods adopt local point-level denoising diffusion probabilistic models, which require predicting Gaussian noise, leading to a mismatch between training and inference initial distributions. This paper introduces the first flow matching framework for 3D LiDAR scene completion, improving upon diffusion-based methods by ensuring consistent initial distributions between training and inference. The model employs a nearest neighbor flow matching loss and a Chamfer distance loss to enhance both local structure and global coverage in the alignment of point clouds. LiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Chewing side preference (CSP) has been identified both as a risk factor for temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and behavioral manifestation. Despite TMDs affecting roughly one third of the global population, assessment mainly relies on clinical examinations and self-reports, offering limited insight into everyday jaw function. Continuous CSP monitoring could provide an objective proxy for functional asymmetries. Prior wearable approaches, however, mostly use specialized form factors and demonstrate limited performance. We therefore present CHOMP, the first system for chewing side detection using earphones. Employing OpenEarable 2.0, we collected data from 20 participants with microphones, a bone-conduction microphone, IMU, PPG, and a pressure sensor across eleven foods, five non-chewing activities, and three noise conditions. We apply the Continuous Wavelet Transform to each sensing modality and use the resulting multi-channel scalograms as inputs to CNN-based classifiers. Microphones achieve the strongest single-sensor unit performance, with median F1 scores of 94.5% in leave-one-food-out (LOFO) and 92.6% in leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validations. Fusing sensing modalities further improves performance to 97.7% for LOFO and 95.4% for LOSO, with additional evaluations under noise interference indicating robust performance. Our results establish earphones as a practical platform for continuous CSP monitoring, enabling clinicians and patients to assess jaw function in everyday life.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02233v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enabling AI Deep Potentials for Ab Initio-quality Molecular Dynamics Simulations in GROMACS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02234</link><description>arXiv:2602.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art AI deep potentials provide ab initio-quality results, but at a fraction of the computational cost of first-principles quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory. In this work, we bring AI deep potentials into GROMACS, a production-level Molecular Dynamics (MD) code, by integrating with DeePMD-kit that provides domain-specific deep learning (DL) models of interatomic potential energy and force fields. In particular, we enable AI deep potentials inference across multiple DP model families and DL backends by coupling GROMACS Neural Network Potentials with the C++/CUDA backend in DeePMD-kit. We evaluate two recent large-atom-model architectures, DPA2 that is based on the attention mechanism and DPA3 that is based on GNN, in GROMACS using four ab initio-quality protein-in-water benchmarks (1YRF, 1UBQ, 3LZM, 2PTC) on NVIDIA A100 and GH200 GPUs. Our results show that DPA2 delivers up to 4.23x and 3.18x higher throughput than DPA3 on A100 and GH200 GPUs, respectively. We also provide a characterization study to further contrast DPA2 and DPA3 in throughput, memory usage, and kernel-level execution on GPUs. Our findings identify kernel-launch overhead and domain-decomposed inference as the main optimization priorities for AI deep potentials in production MD simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02234v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agent-Based Software Artifact Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02235</link><description>arXiv:2602.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artifact evaluation has been adopted in the Software Engineering (SE) research community for 15 years, substantially improving research reproducibility across major SE conferences. However, this success has introduced a growing scalability challenge, as artifact evaluation relies heavily on reviewers' manual execution and debugging, leading to escalating human effort amid rapidly increasing paper submissions. To address this problem, we investigate automated artifact evaluation. We first conduct a preliminary study on artifacts from top-tier SE conferences and identify three key challenges: perceiving execution states, maintaining stable execution environments, and recovering from execution errors. Inspired by these findings, we propose ArtifactCopilot, the first end-to-end agent-based framework for automated artifact evaluation. ArtifactCopilot automates environment construction, instruction execution, and error recovery by combining an execution normalization strategy to ensure environment stability with an artifact evaluation graph that transforms README documents into dependency-aware command graphs, enabling structured execution planning, execution-state tracking, and error recovery. Evaluation on 48 real-world artifacts shows that ArtifactCopilot matches human artifact evaluation outcomes for 85.42% of the artifacts, outperforming Claude Code by 52.09 percentage points, while costing only \$0.091 per artifact on average and requiring zero human intervention for 45 out of 48 artifacts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02235v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Online Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Controllers for Autonomous Driving via Real-Time Recurrent RL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02236</link><description>arXiv:2602.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems.

We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02236v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geometry- and Relation-Aware Diffusion for EEG Super-Resolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02238</link><description>arXiv:2602.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent electroencephalography (EEG) spatial super-resolution (SR) methods, while showing improved quality by either directly predicting missing signals from visible channels or adapting latent diffusion-based generative modeling to temporal data, often lack awareness of physiological spatial structure, thereby constraining spatial generation performance. To address this issue, we introduce TopoDiff, a geometry- and relation-aware diffusion model for EEG spatial super-resolution. Inspired by how human experts interpret spatial EEG patterns, TopoDiff incorporates topology-aware image embeddings derived from EEG topographic representations to provide global geometric context for spatial generation, together with a dynamic channel-relation graph that encodes inter-electrode relationships and evolves with temporal dynamics. This design yields a spatially grounded EEG spatial super-resolution framework with consistent performance improvements. Across multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse applications, including SEED/SEED-IV for emotion recognition, PhysioNet motor imagery (MI/MM), and TUSZ for seizure detection, our method achieves substantial gains in generation fidelity and leads to notable improvements in downstream EEG task performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpretability in Deep Time Series Models Demands Semantic Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02239</link><description>arXiv:2602.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep time series models continue to improve predictive performance, yet their deployment remains limited by their black-box nature. In response, existing interpretability approaches in the field keep focusing on explaining the internal model computations, without addressing whether they align or not with how a human would reason about the studied phenomenon. Instead, we state interpretability in deep time series models should pursue semantic alignment: predictions should be expressed in terms of variables that are meaningful to the end user, mediated by spatial and temporal mechanisms that admit user-dependent constraints. In this paper, we formalize this requirement and require that, once established, semantic alignment must be preserved under temporal evolution: a constraint with no analog in static settings. Provided with this definition, we outline a blueprint for semantically aligned deep time series models, identify properties that support trust, and discuss implications for model design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02239v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Variational Entropic Optimal Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02241</link><description>arXiv:2602.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport (EOT) in continuous spaces with quadratic cost is a classical tool for solving the domain translation problem. In practice, recent approaches optimize a weak dual EOT objective depending on a single potential, but doing so is computationally not efficient due to the intractable log-partition term. Existing methods typically resolve this obstacle in one of two ways: by significantly restricting the transport family to obtain closed-form normalization (via Gaussian-mixture parameterizations), or by using general neural parameterizations that require simulation-based training procedures. We propose Variational Entropic Optimal Transport (VarEOT), based on an exact variational reformulation of the log-partition $\log \mathbb{E}[\exp(\cdot)]$ as a tractable minimization over an auxiliary positive normalizer. This yields a differentiable learning objective optimized with stochastic gradients and avoids the necessity of MCMC simulations during the training. We provide theoretical guarantees, including finite-sample generalization bounds and approximation results under universal function approximation. Experiments on synthetic data and unpaired image-to-image translation demonstrate competitive or improved translation quality, while comparisons within the solvers that use the same weak dual EOT objective support the benefit of the proposed optimization principle.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02241v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SysFuSS: System-Level Firmware Fuzzing with Selective Symbolic Execution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02243</link><description>arXiv:2602.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Firmware serves as the critical interface between hardware and software in computing systems, making any bugs or vulnerabilities particularly dangerous as they can cause catastrophic system failures. While fuzzing is a promising approach for identifying design flaws and security vulnerabilities, traditional fuzzers are ineffective at detecting firmware vulnerabilities. For example, existing fuzzers focus on user-level fuzzing, which is not suitable for detecting kernel-level vulnerabilities. Existing fuzzers also face a coverage plateau problem when dealing with complex interactions between firmware and hardware. In this paper, we present an efficient firmware verification framework, SysFuSS, that integrates system-level fuzzing with selective symbolic execution. Our approach leverages system-level emulation for initial fuzzing, and automatically transitions to symbolic execution when coverage reaches a plateau. This strategy enables us to generate targeted test cases that can trigger previously unexplored regions in firmware designs. We have evaluated SysFuSS on real-world embedded firmware, including OpenSSL, WolfBoot, WolfMQTT, HTSlib, MXML, and libIEC. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SysFuSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of both branch coverage and detection of firmware vulnerabilities. Specifically, SysFuSS can detect 118 known vulnerabilities while state-of-the-art can cover only 13 of them. Moreover, SysFuSS takes significantly less time (up to 3.3X, 1.7X on average) to activate these vulnerabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02243v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning While Staying Curious: Entropy-Preserving Supervised Fine-Tuning via Adaptive Self-Distillation for Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02244</link><description>arXiv:2602.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard post-training recipe for large reasoning models, supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning (SFT-then-RL), may limit the benefits of the RL stage: while SFT imitates expert demonstrations, it often causes overconfidence and reduces generation diversity, leaving RL with a narrowed solution space to explore. Adding entropy regularization during SFT is not a cure-all; it tends to flatten token distributions toward uniformity, increasing entropy without improving meaningful exploration capability. In this paper, we propose CurioSFT, an entropy-preserving SFT method designed to enhance exploration capabilities through intrinsic curiosity. It consists of (a) Self-Exploratory Distillation, which distills the model toward a self-generated, temperature-scaled teacher to encourage exploration within its capability; and (b) Entropy-Guided Temperature Selection, which adaptively adjusts distillation strength to mitigate knowledge forgetting by amplifying exploration at reasoning tokens while stabilizing factual tokens. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that, in SFT stage, CurioSFT outperforms the vanilla SFT by 2.5 points on in-distribution tasks and 2.9 points on out-of-distribution tasks. We also verify that exploration capabilities preserved during SFT successfully translate into concrete gains in RL stage, yielding an average improvement of 5.0 points.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02244v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A new Energy Equation Derivation for the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02247</link><description>arXiv:2602.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) are extensions to the well-known Shallow Water Equations (SWE) for the efficient modeling and numerical simulation of free-surface flows. While the SWE typically assume a depth-averaged vertical velocity profile, the SWME allow for vertical variations of the velocity profile. The SWME therefore assume a polynomial profile and then derive additional evolution equations for the polynomial coefficients via higher order depth integration. In this work, we perform a new systematic derivation of the energy equation for a specific variant of the SWME, called the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations (SWLME). The derivation is based on the standard SWE energy equation derivation and includes the skew-symmetric formulation of the model. The new systematic derivation is beneficial for the extension to other SWME variants and their numerical solution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Acoustic Data Transmission Schemes for Ad-Hoc Communication Between Nearby Smart Devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02249</link><description>arXiv:2602.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic data transmission offers a compelling alternative to Bluetooth and NFC by leveraging the ubiquitous speakers and microphones in smartphones and IoT devices. However, most research in this field relies on simulations or limited on-device testing, which makes the real-world reliability of proposed schemes difficult to assess. We systematically reviewed 31 acoustic communication studies for commodity devices and found that none provided accessible source code. After contacting authors and re-implementing three promising schemes, we assembled a testbed of eight representative acoustic communication systems. Using over 11000 smartphone transmissions in both realistic indoor environments and an anechoic chamber, we provide a systematic and repeatable methodology for evaluating the reliability and generalizability of these schemes under real-world conditions. Our results show that many existing schemes face challenges in practical usage, largely due to severe multipath propagation indoors and varying audio characteristics across device models. To support future research and foster more robust evaluations, we release our re-implementations alongside the first comprehensive dataset of real-world acoustic transmissions. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous on-device testing and underscore the need for robust design strategies to bridge the gap between simulation results and reliable IoT deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02249v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Alignment-Aware Model Adaptation via Feedback-Guided Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02258</link><description>arXiv:2602.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning is the primary mechanism for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks; however, standard approaches largely optimize task objectives in isolation and do not account for secondary yet critical alignment objectives (e.g., safety and hallucination avoidance). As a result, downstream fine-tuning can degrade alignment and fail to correct pre-existing misaligned behavior. We propose an alignment-aware fine-tuning framework that integrates feedback from an external alignment signal through policy-gradient-based regularization. Our method introduces an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically balances supervised and alignment-driven gradients on a per-sample basis, prioritizing uncertain or misaligned cases while allowing well-aligned examples to follow standard supervised updates. The framework further learns abstention behavior for fully misaligned inputs, incorporating conservative responses directly into the fine-tuned model. Experiments on general and domain-specific instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate consistent reductions in harmful and hallucinated outputs without sacrificing downstream task performance. Additional analyses show robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, prompt-based attacks, and unsafe initializations, establishing adaptively gated alignment optimization as an effective approach for alignment-preserving and alignment-recovering model adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02258v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unlocking the Duality between Flow and Field Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02261</link><description>arXiv:2602.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) unifies conventional generative paradigms such as diffusion models and flow matching. Interaction Field Matching (IFM) is a newer framework that generalizes Electrostatic Field Matching (EFM) rooted in Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM). While both frameworks define generative dynamics, they start from different objects: CFM specifies a conditional probability path in data space, whereas IFM specifies a physics-inspired interaction field in an augmented data space. This raises a basic question: are CFM and IFM genuinely different, or are they two descriptions of the same underlying dynamics? We show that they coincide for a natural subclass of IFM that we call forward-only IFM. Specifically, we construct a bijection between CFM and forward-only IFM. We further show that general IFM is strictly more expressive: it includes EFM and other interaction fields that cannot be realized within the standard CFM formulation. Finally, we highlight how this duality can benefit both frameworks: it provides a probabilistic interpretation of forward-only IFM and yields novel, IFM-driven techniques for CFM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OmniCode: A Benchmark for Evaluating Software Engineering Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02262</link><description>arXiv:2602.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-powered coding agents are redefining how real-world software is developed. To drive the research towards better coding agents, we require challenging benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the ability of such agents to perform various software engineering tasks. However, popular coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and SWE-Bench focus on narrowly scoped tasks such as competition programming and patch generation. In reality, software engineers have to handle a broader set of tasks for real-world software development. To address this gap, we propose OmniCode, a novel software engineering benchmark that contains a broader and more diverse set of task categories beyond code or patch generation. Overall, OmniCode contains 1794 tasks spanning three programming languages (Python, Java, and C++) and four key categories: bug fixing, test generation, code review fixing, and style fixing. In contrast to prior software engineering benchmarks, the tasks in OmniCode are (1) manually validated to eliminate ill-defined problems, and (2) synthetically crafted or recently curated to avoid data leakage issues, presenting a new framework for synthetically generating diverse software tasks from limited real-world data. We evaluate OmniCode with popular agent frameworks such as SWE-Agent and show that while they may perform well on bug fixing for Python, they fall short on tasks such as Test Generation and in languages such as C++ and Java. For instance, SWE-Agent achieves a maximum of 20.9% with DeepSeek-V3.1 on Java Test Generation tasks. OmniCode aims to serve as a robust benchmark and spur the development of agents that can perform well across different aspects of software development.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Neural operators offer a promising route by learning mappings between function spaces and enabling resolution-independent inference, yet they typically require supervised data. Physics-informed neural networks address this limitation through unsupervised training with physical constraints but often suffer from unstable convergence and limited generalization capability. To overcome these issues, we introduce a multi-stage physics-informed training strategy that achieves convergence by progressively enforcing boundary conditions in the loss landscape and subsequently incorporating interior residuals. At each stage the optimizer is re-initialized, acting as a continuation mechanism that restores stability and prevents gradient stagnation. We further propose the Physics-Informed Spline Fourier Neural Operator (PhIS-FNO), combining Fourier layers with Hermite spline kernels for smooth residual evaluation. Across canonical benchmarks, PhIS-FNO attains a level of accuracy comparable to that of supervised learning, using labeled information only along a narrow boundary region, establishing staged, spline-based optimization as a robust paradigm for physics-informed operator learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02264v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OpenSeal: Good, Fast, and Cheap Construction of an Open-Source Southeast Asian LLM via Parallel Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02266</link><description>arXiv:2602.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be effective tools for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) applications. Although many LLMs are multilingual, most remain English-centric and perform poorly on low-resource languages. Recently, several Southeast Asia-focused LLMs have been developed, but none are truly open source, as they do not publicly disclose their training data. Truly open-source models are important for transparency and for enabling a deeper and more precise understanding of LLM internals and development, including biases, generalization, and multilinguality. Motivated by recent advances demonstrating the effectiveness of parallel data in improving multilingual performance, we conduct controlled and comprehensive experiments to study the effectiveness of parallel data in continual pretraining of LLMs. Our findings show that using only parallel data is the most effective way to extend an LLM to new languages. Using just 34.7B tokens of parallel data and 180 hours on 8x NVIDIA H200 GPUs, we built OpenSeal, the first truly open Southeast Asian LLM that rivals the performance of existing models of similar size.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HopFormer: Sparse Graph Transformers with Explicit Receptive Field Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02268</link><description>arXiv:2602.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformers typically rely on explicit positional or structural encodings and dense global attention to incorporate graph topology. In this work, we show that neither is essential. We introduce HopFormer, a graph Transformer that injects structure exclusively through head-specific n-hop masked sparse attention, without the use of positional encodings or architectural modifications. This design provides explicit and interpretable control over receptive fields while enabling genuinely sparse attention whose computational cost scales linearly with mask sparsity. Through extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse graph structures. Our results further reveal that dense global attention is often unnecessary: on graphs with strong small-world properties, localized attention yields more stable and consistently high performance, while on graphs with weaker small-world effects, global attention offers diminishing returns. Together, these findings challenge prevailing assumptions in graph Transformer design and highlight sparsity-controlled attention as a principled and efficient alternative.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02268v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap with multipanda ros2: A Real-Time ROS2 Framework for Multimanual Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02269</link><description>arXiv:2602.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $multipanda\_ros2$, a novel open-source ROS2 architecture for multi-robot control of Franka Robotics robots. Leveraging ros2 control, this framework provides native ROS2 interfaces for controlling any number of robots from a single process. Our core contributions address key challenges in real-time torque control, including interaction control and robot-environment modeling. A central focus of this work is sustaining a 1kHz control frequency, a necessity for real-time control and a minimum frequency required by safety standards. Moreover, we introduce a controllet-feature design pattern that enables controller-switching delays of $\le 2$ ms, facilitating reproducible benchmarking and complex multi-robot interaction scenarios. To bridge the simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap, we integrate a high-fidelity MuJoCo simulation with quantitative metrics for both kinematic accuracy and dynamic consistency (torques, forces, and control errors). Furthermore, we demonstrate that real-world inertial parameter identification can significantly improve force and torque accuracy, providing a methodology for iterative physics refinement. Our work extends approaches from soft robotics to rigid dual-arm, contact-rich tasks, showcasing a promising method to reduce the sim2real gap and providing a robust, reproducible platform for advanced robotics research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02269v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] dziribot: rag based intelligent conversational agent for algerian arabic dialect</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02270</link><description>arXiv:2602.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid digitalization of customer service has intensified the demand for conversational agents capable of providing accurate and natural interactions. In the Algerian context, this is complicated by the linguistic complexity of Darja, a dialect characterized by non-standardized orthography, extensive code-switching with French, and the simultaneous use of Arabic and Latin (Arabizi) scripts. This paper introduces DziriBOT, a hybrid intelligent conversational agent specifically engineered to overcome these challenges. We propose a multi-layered architecture that integrates specialized Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), allowing for both structured service flows and dynamic, knowledge-intensive responses grounded in curated enterprise documentation. To address the low-resource nature of Darja, we systematically evaluate three distinct approaches: a sparse-feature Rasa pipeline, classical machine learning baselines, and transformer-based fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned DziriBERT model achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results significantly outperform traditional baselines, particularly in handling orthographic noise and rare intents. Ultimately, DziriBOT provides a robust, scalable solution that bridges the gap between formal language models and the linguistic realities of Algerian users, offering a blueprint for dialect-aware automation in the regional market.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02270v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Geometry for PDEs: Regularity, Stability, and Convergence Guarantees</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02271</link><description>arXiv:2602.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for geometric representation, yet their suitability for physics-based simulation remains underexplored. While metrics like Hausdorff distance quantify surface reconstruction quality, they fail to capture the geometric regularity required for provable numerical performance. This work establishes a unified theoretical framework connecting INR training errors to Partial Differential Equation (PDE) (specifically, linear elliptic equation) solution accuracy. We define the minimal geometric regularity required for INRs to support well-posed boundary value problems and derive \emph{a priori} error estimates linking the neural network's function approximation error to the finite element discretization error. Our analysis reveals that to match the convergence rate of linear finite elements, the INR training loss must scale quadratically relative to the mesh size.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02271v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Kimi K2.5: Visual Agentic Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02276</link><description>arXiv:2602.02276v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs have led to significant breakthroughs in various AI applications. However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Backpropagation as Physical Relaxation: Exact Gradients in Finite Time</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02281</link><description>arXiv:2602.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02281v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MoLF: Mixture-of-Latent-Flow for Pan-Cancer Spatial Gene Expression Prediction from Histology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02282</link><description>arXiv:2602.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring spatial transcriptomics (ST) from histology enables scalable histogenomic profiling, yet current methods are largely restricted to single-tissue models. This fragmentation fails to leverage biological principles shared across cancer types and hinders application to data-scarce scenarios. While pan-cancer training offers a solution, the resulting heterogeneity challenges monolithic architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoLF (Mixture-of-Latent-Flow), a generative model for pan-cancer histogenomic prediction. MoLF leverages a conditional Flow Matching objective to map noise to the gene latent manifold, parameterized by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) velocity field. By dynamically routing inputs to specialized sub-networks, this architecture effectively decouples the optimization of diverse tissue patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that MoLF establishes a new state-of-the-art, consistently outperforming both specialized and foundation model baselines on pan-cancer benchmarks. Furthermore, MoLF exhibits zero-shot generalization to cross-species data, suggesting it captures fundamental, conserved histo-molecular mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02282v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Choice-Model-Assisted Q-learning for Delayed-Feedback Revenue Management</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02283</link><description>arXiv:2602.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning for revenue management with delayed feedback, where a substantial fraction of value is determined by customer cancellations and modifications observed days after booking. We propose \emph{choice-model-assisted RL}: a calibrated discrete choice model is used as a fixed partial world model to impute the delayed component of the learning target at decision time. In the fixed-model deployment regime, we prove that tabular Q-learning with model-imputed targets converges to an $O(\varepsilon/(1-\gamma))$ neighborhood of the optimal Q-function, where $\varepsilon$ summarizes partial-model error, with an additional $O(t^{-1/2})$ sampling term. Experiments in a simulator calibrated from 61{,}619 hotel bookings (1{,}088 independent runs) show: (i) no statistically detectable difference from a maturity-buffer DQN baseline in stationary settings; (ii) positive effects under in-family parameter shifts, with significant gains in 5 of 10 shift scenarios after Holm--Bonferroni correction (up to 12.4\%); and (iii) consistent degradation under structural misspecification, where the choice model assumptions are violated (1.4--2.6\% lower revenue). These results characterize when partial behavioral models improve robustness under shift and when they introduce harmful bias.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02283v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4: Empirical Processes from Scratch</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02285</link><description>arXiv:2602.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive Lean 4 formalization of statistical learning theory (SLT) grounded in empirical process theory. Our end-to-end formal infrastructure implement the missing contents in latest Lean 4 Mathlib library, including a complete development of Gaussian Lipschitz concentration, the first formalization of Dudley's entropy integral theorem for sub-Gaussian processes, and an application to least-squares (sparse) regression with a sharp rate. The project was carried out using a human-AI collaborative workflow, in which humans design proof strategies and AI agents execute tactical proof construction, leading to the human-verified Lean 4 toolbox for SLT.

Abstract: This paper presents the DFKI-Speech system developed for the WildSpoof Challenge under the Spoofing aware Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV) track. We propose a robust SASV framework in which a spoofing detector and a speaker verification (SV) network operate in tandem. The spoofing detector employs a self-supervised speech embedding extractor as the frontend, combined with a state-of-the-art graph neural network backend. In addition, a top-3 layer based mixture-of-experts (MoE) is used to fuse high-level and low-level features for effective spoofed utterance detection. For speaker verification, we adapt a low-complexity convolutional neural network that fuses 2D and 1D features at multiple scales, trained with the SphereFace loss. Additionally, contrastive circle loss is applied to adaptively weight positive and negative pairs within each training batch, enabling the network to better distinguish between hard and easy sample pairs. Finally, fixed imposter cohort based AS Norm score normalization and model ensembling are used to further enhance the discriminative capability of the speaker verification system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02286v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Lingual Stability of LLM Judges Under Controlled Generation: Evidence from Finno-Ugric Languages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02287</link><description>arXiv:2602.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-lingual evaluation of large language models (LLMs) typically conflates two sources of variance: genuine model performance differences and measurement instability. We investigate evaluation reliability by holding generation conditions constant while varying target language. Using synthetic customer-support dialogues generated with identical parameters across Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, we test whether automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge scoring produce stable model rankings across these morphologically rich, related Finno-Ugric languages. With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences.
  This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines. We release our controlled generation protocol, synthetic data, and evaluation framework to enable replication across language families at https://github.com/isaac-chung/cross-lingual-stability-judges.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02287v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Optimization Method for Autoregressive Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02288</link><description>arXiv:2602.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current time-series forecasting models are primarily based on transformer-style neural networks. These models achieve long-term forecasting mainly by scaling up the model size rather than through genuinely autoregressive (AR) rollout. From the perspective of large language model training, the traditional training process for time-series forecasting models ignores temporal causality. In this paper, we propose a novel training method for time-series forecasting that enforces two key properties: (1) AR prediction errors should increase with the forecasting horizon. Any violation of this principle is considered random guessing and is explicitly penalized in the loss function, and (2) the method enables models to concatenate short-term AR predictions for forming flexible long-term forecasts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, achieving an MSE reduction of more than 10% compared to iTransformer and other recent strong baselines. Furthermore, it enables short-horizon forecasting models to perform reliable long-term predictions at horizons over 7.5 times longer.

Abstract: Generative AI can turn scientific articles into narratives for diverse audiences, but evaluating these stories remains challenging. Storytelling demands abstraction, simplification, and pedagogical creativity-qualities that are not often well-captured by standard summarization metrics. Meanwhile, factual hallucinations are critical in scientific contexts, yet, detectors often misclassify legitimate narrative reformulations or prove unstable when creativity is involved. In this work, we propose StoryScore, a composite metric for evaluating AI-generated scientific stories. StoryScore integrates semantic alignment, lexical grounding, narrative control, structural fidelity, redundancy avoidance, and entity-level hallucination detection into a unified framework. Our analysis also reveals why many hallucination detection methods fail to distinguish pedagogical creativity from factual errors, highlighting a key limitation: while automatic metrics can effectively assess semantic similarity with original content, they struggle to evaluate how it is narrated and controlled.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02290v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The SPARSE-Relativization Framework and Applications to Optimal Proof Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02294</link><description>arXiv:2602.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the following longstanding open questions raised by Kraj\'i\v{c}ek and Pudl\'ak (J. Symb. L. 1989), Sadowski (FCT 1997), K\"obler and Messner (CCC 1998) and Messner (PhD 2000).
  Q1: Does TAUT have (p-)optimal proof systems?
  Q2: Does QBF have (p-)optimal proof systems?
  Q3: Are there arbitrarily complex sets with (p-)optimal proof systems?
  Recently, Egidy and Gla{\ss}er (STOC 2025) contributed to these questions by constructing oracles that show that there are no relativizable proofs for positive answers of these questions, even when assuming well-established conjectures about the separation of complexity classes. We continue this line of research by providing the same proof barrier for negative answers of these questions. For this, we introduce the SPARSE-relativization framework, which is an application of the notion of bounded relativization by Hirahara, Lu, and Ren (CCC 2023). This framework allows the construction of sparse oracles for statements such that additional useful properties (like an infinite polynomial-time hierarchy) hold. By applying the SPARSE-relativization framework, we show that the oracle construction of Egidy and Gla{\ss}er also yields the following new oracle.
  O1: No set in PSPACE\NP has optimal proof systems, $\mathrm{NP} \subsetneq \mathrm{PH} \subsetneq \mathrm{PSPACE}$, and PH collapses
  We use techniques of Cook and Kraj\'i\v{c}ek (J. Symb. L. 2007) and Beyersdorff, K\"obler, and M\"uller (Inf. Comp. 2011) and apply our SPARSE-relativization framework to obtain the following new oracle.
  O2: All sets in PSPACE have p-optimal proof systems, there are arbitrarily complex sets with p-optimal proof systems, and PH is infinite
  Together with previous results, our oracles show that questions Q1 and Q2 are independent of an infinite or collapsing polynomial-time hierarchy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02294v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EvalQReason: A Framework for Step-Level Reasoning Evaluation in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02295</link><description>arXiv:2602.02295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications requiring reliable reasoning, yet their internal reasoning processes remain difficult to evaluate systematically. Existing methods focus on final-answer correctness, providing limited insight into how reasoning unfolds across intermediate steps. We present EvalQReason, a framework that quantifies LLM reasoning quality through step-level probability distribution analysis without requiring human annotation. The framework introduces two complementary algorithms: Consecutive Step Divergence (CSD), which measures local coherence between adjacent reasoning steps, and Step-to-Final Convergence (SFC), which assesses global alignment with final answers. Each algorithm employs five statistical metrics to capture reasoning dynamics. Experiments across mathematical and medical datasets with open-source 7B-parameter models demonstrate that CSD-based features achieve strong predictive performance for correctness classification, with classical machine learning models reaching F1=0.78 and ROC-AUC=0.82, and sequential neural models substantially improving performance (F1=0.88, ROC-AUC=0.97). CSD consistently outperforms SFC, and sequential architectures outperform classical machine learning approaches. Critically, reasoning dynamics prove domain-specific: mathematical reasoning exhibits clear divergence-based discrimination patterns between correct and incorrect solutions, while medical reasoning shows minimal discriminative signals, revealing fundamental differences in how LLMs process different reasoning types. EvalQReason enables scalable, process-aware evaluation of reasoning reliability, establishing probability-based divergence analysis as a principled approach for trustworthy AI deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoupling Generalizability and Membership Privacy Risks in Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02296</link><description>arXiv:2602.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep learning model usually has to sacrifice some utilities when it acquires some other abilities or characteristics. Privacy preservation has such trade-off relationships with utilities. The loss disparity between various defense approaches implies the potential to decouple generalizability and privacy risks to maximize privacy gain. In this paper, we identify that the model's generalization and privacy risks exist in different regions in deep neural network architectures. Based on the observations that we investigate, we propose Privacy-Preserving Training Principle (PPTP) to protect model components from privacy risks while minimizing the loss in generalizability. Through extensive evaluations, our approach shows significantly better maintenance in model generalizability while enhancing privacy preservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02296v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When more precision is worse: Do people recognize inadequate scene representations in concept-based explainable AI?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02298</link><description>arXiv:2602.02298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to help uncover flaws in an AI model's internal representations. But do people draw the right conclusions from its explanations? Specifically, do they recognize an AI's inability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant features? In the present study, a simulated AI classified images of railway trespassers as dangerous or not. To explain which features it has used, other images from the dataset were shown that activate the AI in a similar way. These concept images varied in three relevant features (i.e., a person's distance to the tracks, direction, and action) and in an irrelevant feature (i.e., scene background). When the AI uses a feature in its decision, this feature is retained in the concept images, otherwise the images randomize over it (e.g., same distance, varied backgrounds). Participants rated the AI more favorably when it retained relevant features. For the irrelevant feature, they did not mind in general, and sometimes even preferred it to be retained. This suggests that people may not recognize it when an AI model relies on irrelevant features to make its decisions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02298v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advancing General-Purpose Reasoning Models with Modular Gradient Surgery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02301</link><description>arXiv:2602.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has played a central role in recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs), yielding strong gains in verifiable and open-ended reasoning. However, training a single general-purpose LRM across diverse domains remains challenging due to pronounced domain heterogeneity. Through a systematic study of two widely used strategies, Sequential RL and Mixed RL, we find that both incur substantial cross-domain interference at the behavioral and gradient levels, resulting in limited overall gains. To address these challenges, we introduce **M**odular **G**radient **S**urgery (**MGS**), which resolves gradient conflicts at the module level within the transformer. When applied to Llama and Qwen models, MGS achieves average improvements of 4.3 (16.6\%) and 4.5 (11.1\%) points, respectively, over standard multi-task RL across three representative domains (math, general chat, and instruction following). Further analysis demonstrates that MGS remains effective under prolonged training. Overall, our study clarifies the sources of interference in multi-domain RL and presents an effective solution for training general-purpose LRMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: Explaining Behavioral Shifts in Large Language Models Requires a Comparative Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02304</link><description>arXiv:2602.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale foundation models exhibit behavioral shifts: intervention-induced behavioral changes that appear after scaling, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning or in-context learning. While investigating these phenomena have recently received attention, explaining their appearance is still overlooked. Classic explainable AI (XAI) methods can surface failures at a single checkpoint of a model, but they are structurally ill-suited to justify what changed internally across different checkpoints and which explanatory claims are warranted about that change. We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($\Delta$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods. To highlight how $\Delta$-XAI methods work, we introduce a set of possible pipelines, relate them to the desiderata, and provide a concrete $\Delta$-XAI experiment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02304v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spark: Modular Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02306</link><description>arXiv:2602.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, neural networks act as a synonym for artificial intelligence. Present neural network models, although remarkably powerful, are inefficient both in terms of data and energy. Several alternative forms of neural networks have been proposed to address some of these problems. Specifically, spiking neural networks are suitable for efficient hardware implementations. However, effective learning algorithms for spiking networks remain elusive, although it is suspected that effective plasticity mechanisms could alleviate the problem of data efficiency. Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms. We hope that a framework compatible with traditional ML pipelines may accelerate research in the area, specifically for continuous and unbatched learning, akin to the one animals exhibit.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02306v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpreting and Controlling LLM Reasoning through Integrated Policy Gradient</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02313</link><description>arXiv:2602.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities in solving complex real-world problems. Yet, the internal mechanisms driving these complex reasoning behaviors remain opaque. Existing interpretability approaches targeting reasoning either identify components (e.g., neurons) correlated with special textual patterns, or rely on human-annotated contrastive pairs to derive control vectors. Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02313v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Shape of Beliefs: Geometry, Dynamics, and Interventions along Representation Manifolds of Language Models' Posteriors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02315</link><description>arXiv:2602.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent prompt-conditioned beliefs (posteriors over answers and claims), but we lack a mechanistic account of how these beliefs are encoded in representation space, how they update with new evidence, and how interventions reshape them. We study a controlled setting in which Llama-3.2 generates samples from a normal distribution by implicitly inferring its parameters (mean and standard deviation) given only samples from the distribution in context. We find representations of curved "belief manifolds" for these parameters form with sufficient in-context learning and study how the model adapts when the distribution suddenly changes. While standard linear steering often pushes the model off-manifold and induces coupled, out-of-distribution shifts, geometry and field-aware steering better preserves the intended belief family. Our work demonstrates an example of linear field probing (LFP) as a simple approach to tile the data manifold and make interventions that respect the underlying geometry. We conclude that rich structure emerges naturally in LLMs and that purely linear concept representations are often an inadequate abstraction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02315v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Indoor Occupancy Prediction via Sparse Query-Based Multi-Level Consistent Knowledge Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02318</link><description>arXiv:2602.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occupancy prediction provides critical geometric and semantic understanding for robotics but faces efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Current dense methods suffer computational waste on empty voxels, while sparse query-based approaches lack robustness in diverse and complex indoor scenes. In this paper, we propose DiScene, a novel sparse query-based framework that leverages multi-level distillation to achieve efficient and robust occupancy prediction. In particular, our method incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Multi-level Consistent Knowledge Distillation strategy, which transfers hierarchical representations from large teacher models to lightweight students through coordinated alignment across four levels, including encoder-level feature alignment, query-level feature matching, prior-level spatial guidance, and anchor-level high-confidence knowledge transfer and (2) a Teacher-Guided Initialization policy, employing optimized parameter warm-up to accelerate model convergence. Validated on the Occ-Scannet benchmark, DiScene achieves 23.2 FPS without depth priors while outperforming our baseline method, OPUS, by 36.1% and even better than the depth-enhanced version, OPUS{\dag}. With depth integration, DiScene{\dag} attains new SOTA performance, surpassing EmbodiedOcc by 3.7% with 1.62$\times$ faster inference speed. Furthermore, experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and in-the-wild scenarios demonstrate the versatility of our approach in various environments.

Abstract: Molecular function is largely determined by structure. Accurately aligning molecular structure with natural language is therefore essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to reason about downstream chemical tasks. However, the substantial cost of human annotation makes it infeasible to construct large-scale, high-quality datasets of structure-grounded descriptions. In this work, we propose a fully automated annotation framework for generating precise molecular structure descriptions at scale. Our approach builds upon and extends a rule-based chemical nomenclature parser to interpret IUPAC names and construct enriched, structured XML metadata that explicitly encodes molecular structure. This metadata is then used to guide LLMs in producing accurate natural-language descriptions. Using this framework, we curate a large-scale dataset of approximately $163$k molecule-description pairs. A rigorous validation protocol combining LLM-based and expert human evaluation on a subset of $2,000$ molecules demonstrates a high description precision of $98.6\%$. The resulting dataset provides a reliable foundation for future molecule-language alignment, and the proposed annotation method is readily extensible to larger datasets and broader chemical tasks that rely on structural descriptions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02320v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language Steering for Multilingual In-Context Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02326</link><description>arXiv:2602.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multilingual large language models have gained widespread adoption, their performance on non-English languages remains substantially inferior to English. This disparity is particularly evident in in-context learning scenarios, where providing demonstrations in English but testing on non-English inputs leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs develop a universal semantic space for understanding languages, where different languages are encoded as distinct directions within this space. Based on this hypothesis, we propose language vectors -- a training-free language steering approach that leverages activation differences between source and target languages to guide model behavior. We steer the model generations by adding the vector to the intermediate model activations during inference. This is done to make the model's internal representations shift towards the target language space without any parameter updates. We evaluate our method across three datasets and test on a total of 19 languages on three different models. Our results show consistent improvements on multilingual in-context learning over baselines across all tasks and languages tested. Beyond performance gains, hierarchical clustering of steering vectors reveals meaningful linguistic structure aligned with language families. These vectors also successfully transfer across tasks, demonstrating that these representations are task-agnostic.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TTT-Parkour: Rapid Test-Time Training for Perceptive Robot Parkour</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02331</link><description>arXiv:2602.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving highly dynamic humanoid parkour on unseen, complex terrains remains a challenge in robotics. Although general locomotion policies demonstrate capabilities across broad terrain distributions, they often struggle with arbitrary and highly challenging environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a real-to-sim-to-real framework that leverages rapid test-time training (TTT) on novel terrains, significantly enhancing the robot's capability to traverse extremely difficult geometries. We adopt a two-stage end-to-end learning paradigm: a policy is first pre-trained on diverse procedurally generated terrains, followed by rapid fine-tuning on high-fidelity meshes reconstructed from real-world captures. Specifically, we develop a feed-forward, efficient, and high-fidelity geometry reconstruction pipeline using RGB-D inputs, ensuring both speed and quality during test-time training. We demonstrate that TTT-Parkour empowers humanoid robots to master complex obstacles, including wedges, stakes, boxes, trapezoids, and narrow beams. The whole pipeline of capturing, reconstructing, and test-time training requires less than 10 minutes on most tested terrains. Extensive experiments show that the policy after test-time training exhibits robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02331v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VQ-Style: Disentangling Style and Content in Motion with Residual Quantized Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02334</link><description>arXiv:2602.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion data is inherently rich and complex, containing both semantic content and subtle stylistic features that are challenging to model. We propose a novel method for effective disentanglement of the style and content in human motion data to facilitate style transfer. Our approach is guided by the insight that content corresponds to coarse motion attributes while style captures the finer, expressive details. To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the disentanglement by integrating contrastive learning and a novel information leakage loss with codebook learning to organize the content and the style across different codebooks. We harness this disentangled representation using our simple and effective inference-time technique Quantized Code Swapping, which enables motion style transfer without requiring any fine-tuning for unseen styles. Our framework demonstrates strong versatility across multiple inference applications, including style transfer, style removal, and motion blending.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Generative Recommender Tokenizer: Recsys-Native Encoding and Semantic Quantization Beyond LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02338</link><description>arXiv:2602.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic ID (SID)-based recommendation is a promising paradigm for scaling sequential recommender systems, but existing methods largely follow a semantic-centric pipeline: item embeddings are learned from foundation models and discretized using generic quantization schemes. This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

Abstract: The study of Locally Checkable Labelings (LCLs) has led to a remarkably precise characterization of the distributed time complexities that can occur on bounded-degree trees. A central feature of this complexity landscape is the existence of strong gap results, which rule out large ranges of intermediate complexities. While it was initially hoped that these gaps might extend to more general graph classes, this has turned out not to be the case. In this work, we investigate a different direction: we remain in the class of trees, but allow arbitrarily large degrees.
  We focus on the polynomial regime ($\Theta(n^{1/k} \mid k \in \mathbb{N})$) and show that whether polynomial gap results persist in the unbounded-degree setting crucially depends on how LCLs are generalized beyond bounded degrees. We first demonstrate that if one allows LCLs to be defined using infinitely many local configurations, then the polynomial gaps disappear entirely: for every real exponent $0 &lt; r \leq 1$, there exists a locally checkable problem on trees with deterministic LOCAL complexity $\Theta(n^r)$.
  Rather than stopping at this negative result, we identify a natural class of problems for which polynomial gap results can still be recovered. We introduce Locally Finite Labelings (LFLs), which formalize the intuition that ''every node must fall into one of finitely many local cases'', even in the presence of unbounded degrees.
  Our main result shows that this restriction is sufficient to restore the polynomial gaps: for any LFL $\Pi$ on trees with unbounded degrees, the deterministic LOCAL complexity of $\Pi$ is either
  - $\Theta(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \geq 1$, or
  - $O(\log n)$.
  Moreover, which case applies, and the corresponding value of $k$, can be determined solely from the description of $\Pi$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02340v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LongVPO: From Anchored Cues to Self-Reasoning for Long-Form Video Preference Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02341</link><description>arXiv:2602.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LongVPO, a novel two-stage Direct Preference Optimization framework that enables short-context vision-language models to robustly understand ultra-long videos without any long-video annotations. In Stage 1, we synthesize preference triples by anchoring questions to individual short clips, interleaving them with distractors, and applying visual-similarity and question-specificity filtering to mitigate positional bias and ensure unambiguous supervision. We also approximate the reference model's scoring over long contexts by evaluating only the anchor clip, reducing computational overhead. In Stage 2, we employ a recursive captioning pipeline on long videos to generate scene-level metadata, then use a large language model to craft multi-segment reasoning queries and dispreferred responses, aligning the model's preferences through multi-segment reasoning tasks. With only 16K synthetic examples and no costly human labels, LongVPO outperforms the state-of-the-art open-source models on multiple long-video benchmarks, while maintaining strong short-video performance (e.g., on MVBench), offering a scalable paradigm for efficient long-form video understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02341v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Steering Works: Toward a Unified View of Language Model Parameter Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02343</link><description>arXiv:2602.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for controlling large language models (LLMs), including local weight fine-tuning, LoRA-based adaptation, and activation-based interventions, are often studied in isolation, obscuring their connections and making comparison difficult. In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comparative study of five autonomous coding agents using AIDev-pop, which is a public dataset containing thousands of AI-generated pull requests (PRs) across popular open-source repositories. We evaluate agents' performance along three task-aware dimensions spanning the PR lifecycle: (1) PR acceptance rate, (2) review discussion volume, and (3) commit message quality. Our quantitative analysis finds that Codex consistently achieves high PR acceptance rates across most task categories, while Copilot's PRs trigger the highest volume of both human and automated review discussions. In contrast, commit-level quality varies independently of acceptance outcomes. Claude and Cursor produce higher proportions of high-quality commit messages across several task types, and Codex exhibiting comparatively lower commit quality despite strong integration outcomes. Our findings inform selection and improvements of AI agents for their effective integration to collaborative software engineering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02345v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modelling Socio-Psychological Drivers of Land Management Intensity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02347</link><description>arXiv:2602.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land management intensity shapes ecosystem service provision, socio-ecological resilience and is central to sustainable transformation. Yet most land use models emphasise economic and biophysical drivers, while socio-psychological factors influencing land managers' decisions remain underrepresented despite increasing evidence that they shape land management choices. To address this gap, we develop a generic behavioural extension for agent-based land use models, guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an overarching conceptual framework. The extension integrates environmental attitudes, descriptive social norms and behavioural inertia into land managers' decisions on land management intensity. To demonstrate applicability, the extension is coupled to an existing land use modelling framework and explored in stylised settings to isolate behavioural mechanisms. Results show that socio-psychological drivers can significantly alter land management intensity shares, landscape configuration, and ecosystem service provision. Nonlinear feedbacks between these drivers, spatial resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem service demand lead to emergent dynamics that are sometimes counter-intuitive and can diverge from the agent-level decision rules. Increasing the influence of social norms generates spatial clustering and higher landscape connectivity, while feedbacks between behavioural factors can lead to path dependence, lock-in effects, and the emergence of multiple stable regimes with sharp transitions. The proposed framework demonstrates how even low levels of behavioural diversity and social interactions can reshape system-level land use outcomes and provides a reusable modelling component for incorporating socio-psychological processes into land use simulations. The approach can be integrated into other agent-based land use models and parameterised empirically in future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02347v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context Learning for Multi-Agent Discussion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02350</link><description>arXiv:2602.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Discussion (MAD) has garnered increasing attention very recently, where multiple LLM instances collaboratively solve problems via structured discussion. However, we find that current MAD methods easily suffer from discussion inconsistency, LLMs fail to reach a coherent solution, due to the misalignment between their individual contexts.In this paper, we introduce a multi-LLM context learning method (M2CL) that learns a context generator for each agent, capable of dynamically generating context instructions per discussion round via automatic information organization and refinement. Specifically, inspired by our theoretical insights on the context instruction, M2CL train the generators to control context coherence and output discrepancies via a carefully crafted self-adaptive mechanism.It enables LLMs to avoid premature convergence on majority noise and progressively reach the correct consensus. We evaluate M2CL on challenging tasks, including academic reasoning, embodied tasks, and mobile control. The results show that the performance of M2CL significantly surpasses existing methods by 20%--50%, while enjoying favorable transferability and computational efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02350v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Well-Formed Free-Choice Petri Nets Revisited</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02352</link><description>arXiv:2602.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of free-choice Petri nets is an established field, initiated in the 1970s by Commoner and Hack at MIT. We revisit well-formed free-choice nets (those admitting markings that are both live and bounded) and provide a new characterization by introducing semi-T-components. This notion is dual to that of semi-S-components, which in turn correspond to the well-known minimal siphons. By highlighting the symmetry between these dual concepts, we derive the classical coverability theorems for T- and S-components, as well as the duality theorem -- stating that a free-choice net is well-formed if and only if its reverse-dual is also well-formed -- using arguments that are as symmetric as possible.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implicit neural representation of textures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02354</link><description>arXiv:2602.02354v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as a key architecture for large-scale wireless and Internet of Things systems, where devices communicate with nearby edge servers before reaching the cloud. In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NAB: Neural Adaptive Binning for Sparse-View CT reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02356</link><description>arXiv:2602.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in inspecting the internal structures of industrial objects. Furthermore, achieving high-quality CT reconstruction from sparse views is essential for reducing production costs. While classic implicit neural networks have shown promising results for sparse reconstruction, they are unable to leverage shape priors of objects. Motivated by the observation that numerous industrial objects exhibit rectangular structures, we propose a novel \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{B}inning (\textbf{NAB}) method that effectively integrates rectangular priors into the reconstruction process. Specifically, our approach first maps coordinate space into a binned vector space. This mapping relies on an innovative binning mechanism based on differences between shifted hyperbolic tangent functions, with our extension enabling rotations around the input-plane normal vector. The resulting representations are then processed by a neural network to predict CT attenuation coefficients. This design enables end-to-end optimization of the encoding parameters -- including position, size, steepness, and rotation -- via gradient flow from the projection data, thus enhancing reconstruction accuracy. By adjusting the smoothness of the binning function, NAB can generalize to objects with more complex geometries. This research provides a new perspective on integrating shape priors into neural network-based reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAB achieves superior performance on two industrial datasets. It also maintains robust on medical datasets when the binning function is extended to more general expression. The code will be made available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02356v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) Scoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02360</link><description>arXiv:2602.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing soft skills such as empathy, ethical judgment, and communication is essential in competitive selection processes, yet human scoring is often inconsistent and biased. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved Automated Essay Scoring (AES), we show that state-of-the-art rationale-based fine-tuning methods struggle with the abstract, context-dependent nature of Multiple Mini-Interviews (MMIs), missing the implicit signals embedded in candidate narratives. We introduce a multi-agent prompting framework that breaks down the evaluation process into transcript refinement and criterion-specific scoring. Using 3-shot in-context learning with a large instruct-tuned model, our approach outperforms specialised fine-tuned baselines (Avg QWK 0.62 vs 0.32) and achieves reliability comparable to human experts. We further demonstrate the generalisability of our framework on the ASAP benchmark, where it rivals domain-specific state-of-the-art models without additional training. These findings suggest that for complex, subjective reasoning tasks, structured prompt engineering may offer a scalable alternative to data-intensive fine-tuning, altering how LLMs can be applied to automated assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02360v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SWE-Universe: Scale Real-World Verifiable Environments to Millions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02361</link><description>arXiv:2602.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SWE-Universe, a scalable and efficient framework for automatically constructing real-world software engineering (SWE) verifiable environments from GitHub pull requests (PRs). To overcome the prevalent challenges of automatic building, such as low production yield, weak verifiers, and prohibitive cost, our framework utilizes a building agent powered by an efficient custom-trained model. This agent employs iterative self-verification and in-loop hacking detection to ensure the reliable generation of high-fidelity, verifiable tasks. Using this method, we scale the number of real-world multilingual SWE environments to a million scale (807,693). We demonstrate the profound value of our environments through large-scale agentic mid-training and reinforcement learning. Finally, we applied this technique to Qwen3-Max-Thinking and achieved a score of 75.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Our work provides both a critical resource and a robust methodology to advance the next generation of coding agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02361v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReasonCACHE: Teaching LLMs To Reason Without Weight Updates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02366</link><description>arXiv:2602.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can Large language models (LLMs) learn to reason without any weight update and only through in-context learning (ICL)? ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly equipped with memory, which are stored experience and reusable guidance that can improve task-solving performance. Recent \emph{self-evolving} systems update memory based on interaction outcomes, but most existing evolution pipelines are developed for static train/test splits and only approximate online learning by folding static benchmarks, making them brittle under true distribution shift and continuous feedback. We introduce \textsc{Live-Evo}, an online self-evolving memory system that learns from a stream of incoming data over time. \textsc{Live-Evo} decouples \emph{what happened} from \emph{how to use it} via an Experience Bank and a Meta-Guideline Bank, compiling task-adaptive guidelines from retrieved experiences for each task. To manage memory online, \textsc{Live-Evo} maintains experience weights and updates them from feedback: experiences that consistently help are reinforced and retrieved more often, while misleading or stale experiences are down-weighted and gradually forgotten, analogous to reinforcement and decay in human memory. On the live \textit{Prophet Arena} benchmark over a 10-week horizon, \textsc{Live-Evo} improves Brier score by 20.8\% and increases market returns by 12.9\%, while also transferring to deep-research benchmarks with consistent gains over strong baselines.

Abstract: Accurate histopathologic interpretation is key for clinical decision-making; however, current deep learning models for digital pathology are often overconfident and poorly calibrated in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, which limit trust and clinical adoption. Safety-critical medical imaging workflows benefit from intrinsic uncertainty-aware properties that can accurately reject OOD input. We implement the Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a set of lightweight modifications that apply spectral normalization and replace the final dense layer with a Gaussian process layer to improve single-model uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. We evaluate SNGP vs. deterministic and MonteCarlo dropout on six datasets across three biomedical classification tasks: white blood cells, amyloid plaques, and colorectal histopathology. SNGP has comparable in-distribution performance while significantly improving uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. Thus, SNGP or related models offer a useful framework for uncertainty-aware classification in digital pathology, supporting safe deployment and building trust with pathologists.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02370v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] C-kNN-LSH: A Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm for Sequential Counterfactual Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02371</link><description>arXiv:2602.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from longitudinal trajectories is central to understanding the progression of complex conditions and optimizing clinical decision-making, such as comorbidities and long COVID recovery. We introduce \emph{C-kNN--LSH}, a nearest-neighbor framework for sequential causal inference designed to handle such high-dimensional, confounded situations. By utilizing locality-sensitive hashing, we efficiently identify ``clinical twins'' with similar covariate histories, enabling local estimation of conditional treatment effects across evolving disease states. To mitigate bias from irregular sampling and shifting patient recovery profiles, we integrate neighborhood estimator with a doubly-robust correction.
  Theoretical analysis guarantees our estimator is consistent and second-order robust to nuisance error.

Abstract: Biomedical implants offer transformative tools to improve medical outcomes. To realize minimally invasive implants with miniaturized volume and weight, wireless power transfer has been extensively studied to replace bulky batteries that dominate the volume of traditional implants and require surgical replacements. Ultra-sonic and magnetoelectric WPT modalities, which leverage low frequency acoustic electrical coupling for energy transduction, become viable solutions for mm-scale receivers. This work presents a fully integrated power management unit for ME WPT in millimetric implants. The PMU achieves load independent maximum power extraction and usage by continuously matching the impedance of the transducer, dynamically optimizing the power stage across varying input divided by load conditions, and reusing the storage energy to sustain the system when input power drops. Its parallel-input regulation and storing stages architecture prevent the cascading power loss. With the skewed-duty-cycle MPPT technique and regulation efficiency optimizer, the PMU achieves a peak MPPT efficiency of 98.5 percent and a peak system overall efficiency of 73.33 percent. Additionally, the PMU includes an adaptive high-voltage charging stage that charges the stimulation capacitor up to 12 V with an improved efficiency of 37.88 percent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02376v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Proof-RM: A Scalable and Generalizable Reward Model for Math Proof</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02377</link><description>arXiv:2602.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong math reasoning abilities through Reinforcement Learning with *Verifiable Rewards* (RLVR), many advanced mathematical problems are proof-based, with no guaranteed way to determine the authenticity of a proof by simple answer matching. To enable automatic verification, a Reward Model (RM) capable of reliably evaluating full proof processes is required. In this work, we design a *scalable* data-construction pipeline that, with minimal human effort, leverages LLMs to generate a large quantity of high-quality "**question-proof-check**" triplet data. By systematically varying problem sources, generation methods, and model configurations, we create diverse problem-proof pairs spanning multiple difficulty levels, linguistic styles, and error types, subsequently filtered through hierarchical human review for label alignment. Utilizing these data, we train a proof-checking RM, incorporating additional process reward and token weight balance to stabilize the RL process. Our experiments validate the model's scalability and strong performance from multiple perspectives, including reward accuracy, generalization ability and test-time guidance, providing important practical recipes and tools for strengthening LLM mathematical capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02377v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Sycophancy to Sensemaking: Premise Governance for Human-AI Decision Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02378</link><description>arXiv:2602.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs expand from assistance to decision support, a dangerous pattern emerges: fluent agreement without calibrated judgment. Low-friction assistants can become sycophantic, baking in implicit assumptions and pushing verification costs onto experts, while outcomes arrive too late to serve as reward signals. In deep-uncertainty decisions (where objectives are contested and reversals are costly), scaling fluent agreement amplifies poor commitments faster than it builds expertise. We argue reliable human-AI partnership requires a shift from answer generation to collaborative premise governance over a knowledge substrate, negotiating only what is decision-critical. A discrepancy-driven control loop operates over this substrate: detecting conflicts, localizing misalignment via typed discrepancies (teleological, epistemic, procedural), and triggering bounded negotiation through decision slices. Commitment gating blocks action on uncommitted load-bearing premises unless overridden under logged risk; value-gated challenge allocates probing under interaction cost. Trust then attaches to auditable premises and evidence standards, not conversational fluency. We illustrate with tutoring and propose falsifiable evaluation criteria.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02378v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unified Personalized Reward Model for Vision Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02380</link><description>arXiv:2602.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02380v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Supervised Learning from Structural Invariance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02381</link><description>arXiv:2602.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint-embedding self-supervised learning (SSL), the key paradigm for unsupervised representation learning from visual data, learns from invariances between semantically-related data pairs. We study the one-to-many mapping problem in SSL, where each datum may be mapped to multiple valid targets. This arises when data pairs come from naturally occurring generative processes, e.g., successive video frames. We show that existing methods struggle to flexibly capture this conditional uncertainty. As a remedy, we introduce a latent variable to account for this uncertainty and derive a variational lower bound on the mutual information between paired embeddings. Our derivation yields a simple regularization term for standard SSL objectives. The resulting method, which we call AdaSSL, applies to both contrastive and distillation-based SSL objectives, and we empirically show its versatility in causal representation learning, fine-grained image understanding, and world modeling on videos.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ROG: Retrieval-Augmented LLM Reasoning for Complex First-Order Queries over Knowledge Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02382</link><description>arXiv:2602.02382v1 Announce Type: new

We propose ROG, a retrieval-augmented framework that combines query-aware neighborhood retrieval with large language model (LLM) chain-of-thought reasoning. ROG decomposes a multi-operator query into a sequence of single-operator sub-queries and grounds each step in compact, query-relevant neighborhood evidence. Intermediate answer sets are cached and reused across steps, improving consistency on deep reasoning chains. This design reduces compounding errors and yields more robust inference on complex and negation-heavy queries. Overall, ROG provides a practical alternative to embedding-based logical reasoning by replacing learned operators with retrieval-grounded, step-wise inference. Experiments on standard KG reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains over strong embedding-based baselines, with the largest improvements on high-complexity and negation-heavy query types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02382v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SLIME: Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement for Preference Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02383</link><description>arXiv:2602.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct preference optimization methods have emerged as a computationally efficient alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping. Our results demonstrate that SLIME achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining higher generation stability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02383v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transformers learn factored representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02385</link><description>arXiv:2602.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers pretrained via next token prediction learn to factor their world into parts, representing these factors in orthogonal subspaces of the residual stream. We formalize two representational hypotheses: (1) a representation in the product space of all factors, whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of parts, or (2) a factored representation in orthogonal subspaces, whose dimension grows linearly. The factored representation is lossless when factors are conditionally independent, but sacrifices predictive fidelity otherwise, creating a tradeoff between dimensional efficiency and accuracy. We derive precise predictions about the geometric structure of activations for each, including the number of subspaces, their dimensionality, and the arrangement of context embeddings within them. We test between these hypotheses on transformers trained on synthetic processes with known latent structure. Models learn factored representations when factors are conditionally independent, and continue to favor them early in training even when noise or hidden dependencies undermine conditional independence, reflecting an inductive bias toward factoring at the cost of fidelity. This provides a principled explanation for why transformers decompose the world into parts, and suggests that interpretable low dimensional structure may persist even in models trained on complex data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02385v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trust by Design: Skill Profiles for Transparent, Cost-Aware LLM Routing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02386</link><description>arXiv:2602.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How should Large Language Model (LLM) practitioners select the right model for a task without wasting money? We introduce BELLA (Budget-Efficient LLM Selection via Automated skill-profiling), a framework that recommends optimal LLM selection for tasks through interpretable skill-based model selection. Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models. Our framework enables practitioners to make principled and cost-performance trade-offs for deploying LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Personalized Image Generation via Human-in-the-loop Bayesian Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02388</link><description>arXiv:2602.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine Alice has a specific image $x^\ast$ in her mind, say, the view of the street in which she grew up during her childhood. To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02388v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mapping-Guided Task Discovery and Allocation for Robotic Inspection of Underwater Structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02389</link><description>arXiv:2602.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task generation for underwater multi-robot inspections without prior knowledge of existing geometry can be achieved and optimized through examination of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) data. By considering hardware parameters and environmental conditions, a set of tasks is generated from SLAM meshes and optimized through expected keypoint scores and distance-based pruning. In-water tests are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and determine the appropriate parameters. These results are compared to simulated Voronoi partitions and boustrophedon patterns for inspection coverage on a model of the test environment. The key benefits of the presented task discovery method include adaptability to unexpected geometry and distributions that maintain coverage while focusing on areas more likely to present defects or damage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Infinite-World: Scaling Interactive World Models to 1000-Frame Horizons via Pose-Free Hierarchical Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02393</link><description>arXiv:2602.02393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Infinite-World, a robust interactive world model capable of maintaining coherent visual memory over 1000+ frames in complex real-world environments. While existing world models can be efficiently optimized on synthetic data with perfect ground-truth, they lack an effective training paradigm for real-world videos due to noisy pose estimations and the scarcity of viewpoint revisits. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a Hierarchical Pose-free Memory Compressor (HPMC) that recursively distills historical latents into a fixed-budget representation. By jointly optimizing the compressor with the generative backbone, HPMC enables the model to autonomously anchor generations in the distant past with bounded computational cost, eliminating the need for explicit geometric priors. Second, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Action Labeling module that discretizes continuous motion into a tri-state logic. This strategy maximizes the utilization of raw video data while shielding the deterministic action space from being corrupted by noisy trajectories, ensuring robust action-response learning. Furthermore, guided by insights from a pilot toy study, we employ a Revisit-Dense Finetuning Strategy using a compact, 30-minute dataset to efficiently activate the model's long-range loop-closure capabilities. Extensive experiments, including objective metrics and user studies, demonstrate that Infinite-World achieves superior performance in visual quality, action controllability, and spatial consistency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02393v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] David vs. Goliath: Verifiable Agent-to-Agent Jailbreaking via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02395</link><description>arXiv:2602.02395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of large language models into autonomous agents introduces adversarial failures that exploit legitimate tool privileges, transforming safety evaluation in tool-augmented environments from a subjective NLP task into an objective control problem. We formalize this threat model as Tag-Along Attacks: a scenario where a tool-less adversary "tags along" on the trusted privileges of a safety-aligned Operator to induce prohibited tool use through conversation alone. To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3. Crucially, Slingshot transfers zero-shot to several model families, including closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (56.0% attack success rate) and defensive-fine-tuned open-source models like Meta-SecAlign-8B (39.2% attack success rate). Our work establishes Tag-Along Attacks as a first-class, verifiable threat model and shows that effective agentic attacks can be elicited from off-the-shelf open-weight models through environment interaction alone.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02395v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PRISM: Performer RS-IMLE for Single-pass Multisensory Imitation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02396</link><description>arXiv:2602.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic imitation learning typically requires models that capture multimodal action distributions while operating at real-time control rates and accommodating multiple sensing modalities. Although recent generative approaches such as diffusion models, flow matching, and Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) have achieved promising results, they often satisfy only a subset of these requirements. To address this, we introduce PRISM, a single-pass policy based on a batch-global rejection-sampling variant of IMLE. PRISM couples a temporal multisensory encoder (integrating RGB, depth, tactile, audio, and proprioception) with a linear-attention generator using a Performer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of PRISM on a diverse real-world hardware suite, including loco-manipulation using a Unitree Go2 with a 7-DoF arm D1 and tabletop manipulation with a UR5 manipulator. Across challenging physical tasks such as pre-manipulation parking, high-precision insertion, and multi-object pick-and-place, PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies by 10-25% in success rate while maintaining high-frequency (30-50 Hz) closed-loop control. We further validate our approach on large-scale simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Robomimic. In CALVIN (10% data split), PRISM improves success rates by approximately 25% over diffusion and approximately 20% over flow matching, while simultaneously reducing trajectory jerk by 20x-50x. These results position PRISM as a fast, accurate, and multisensory imitation policy that retains multimodal action coverage without the latency of iterative sampling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02396v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Talking Inspiration: A Discourse Analysis of Data Visualization Podcasts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02397</link><description>arXiv:2602.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data visualization practitioners routinely invoke inspiration, yet we know little about how it is constructed in public conversations. We conduct a discourse analysis of 31 episodes from five popular data visualization podcasts. Podcasts are public-facing and inherently performative: guests manage impressions, articulate values, and model "good practice" for broad audiences. We use this performative setting to examine how legitimacy, identity, and practice are negotiated in community talk. We show that "inspiration talk" is operative rather than ornamental: speakers legitimize what counts, who counts, and how work proceeds. Our analysis surfaces four adjustable evaluation criteria by which inspiration is judged-novelty, authority, authenticity, and affect-and three operative metaphors that license different practices-spark, muscle, and resource bank. We argue that treating inspiration as a boundary object helps explain why these frames coexist across contexts. Findings provide a vocabulary for examining how inspiration is mobilized in visualization practice, with implications for evaluation, pedagogy, and the design of galleries and repositories that surface inspirational examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02397v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Empirical Study on Noisy Data and LLM Pretraining Loss Divergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02400</link><description>arXiv:2602.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pretraining datasets drive the success of large language models (LLMs). However, these web-scale corpora inevitably contain large amounts of noisy data due to unregulated web content or randomness inherent in data. Although LLM pretrainers often speculate that such noise contributes to instabilities in large-scale LLM pretraining and, in the worst cases, loss divergence, this phenomenon remains poorly understood.In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of whether noisy data causes LLM pretraining divergences and how it does so. By injecting controlled synthetic uniformly random noise into otherwise clean datasets, we analyze training dynamics across model sizes ranging from 480M to 5.2B parameters. We show that noisy data indeed induces training loss divergence, and that the probability of divergence depends strongly on the noise type, amount of noise, and model scale. We further find that noise-induced divergences exhibit activation patterns distinct from those caused by high learning rates, and we provide diagnostics that differentiate these two failure modes. Together, these results provide a large-scale, controlled characterization of how noisy data affects loss divergence in LLM pretraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02400v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Superman: Unifying Skeleton and Vision for Human Motion Perception and Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02401</link><description>arXiv:2602.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion analysis tasks, such as temporal 3D pose estimation, motion prediction, and motion in-betweening, play an essential role in computer vision. However, current paradigms suffer from severe fragmentation. First, the field is split between ``perception'' models that understand motion from video but only output text, and ``generation'' models that cannot perceive from raw visual input. Second, generative MLLMs are often limited to single-frame, static poses using dense, parametric SMPL models, failing to handle temporal motion. Third, existing motion vocabularies are built from skeleton data alone, severing the link to the visual domain. To address these challenges, we introduce Superman, a unified framework that bridges visual perception with temporal, skeleton-based motion generation. Our solution is twofold. First, to overcome the modality disconnect, we propose a Vision-Guided Motion Tokenizer. Leveraging the natural geometric alignment between 3D skeletons and visual data, this module pioneers robust joint learning from both modalities, creating a unified, cross-modal motion vocabulary. Second, grounded in this motion language, a single, unified MLLM architecture is trained to handle all tasks. This module flexibly processes diverse, temporal inputs, unifying 3D skeleton pose estimation from video (perception) with skeleton-based motion prediction and in-betweening (generation). Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, demonstrate that our unified method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all motion tasks. This showcases a more efficient and scalable path for generative motion analysis using skeletons.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02401v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SoMA: A Real-to-Sim Neural Simulator for Robotic Soft-body Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02402</link><description>arXiv:2602.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating deformable objects under rich interactions remains a fundamental challenge for real-to-sim robot manipulation, with dynamics jointly driven by environmental effects and robot actions. Existing simulators rely on predefined physics or data-driven dynamics without robot-conditioned control, limiting accuracy, stability, and generalization. This paper presents SoMA, a 3D Gaussian Splat simulator for soft-body manipulation. SoMA couples deformable dynamics, environmental forces, and robot joint actions in a unified latent neural space for end-to-end real-to-sim simulation. Modeling interactions over learned Gaussian splats enables controllable, stable long-horizon manipulation and generalization beyond observed trajectories without predefined physical models. SoMA improves resimulation accuracy and generalization on real-world robot manipulation by 20%, enabling stable simulation of complex tasks such as long-horizon cloth folding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Didactic to Constructive: Turning Expert Solutions into Learnable Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02405</link><description>arXiv:2602.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies either on the model's ability to sample a correct solution to be reinforced or on the existence of a stronger model able to solve the problem. However, many difficult problems remain intractable for even current frontier models, preventing the extraction of valid training signals. A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 10-25% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2x to 4x, and enable out-of-domain generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02405v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReasonEdit: Editing Vision-Language Models using Human Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02408</link><description>arXiv:2602.02408v1 Announce Type: new

ReasonEdit continuously stores human reasoning in a codebook, and retrieves only relevant facts during inference using a novel topology-balanced multimodal embedding method inspired by network science. Across four VLMs on multiple rationale-based visual question answering datasets, ReasonEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance, ultimately showing that using human reasoning during editing greatly improves edit generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02408v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Catalyst: Out-of-Distribution Detection via Elastic Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02409</link><description>arXiv:2602.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of deep neural networks. State-of-the-art post-hoc methods typically derive OOD scores from the output logits or penultimate feature vector obtained via global average pooling (GAP). We contend that this exclusive reliance on the logit or feature vector discards a rich, complementary signal: the raw channel-wise statistics of the pre-pooling feature map lost in GAP. In this paper, we introduce Catalyst, a post-hoc framework that exploits these under-explored signals. Catalyst computes an input-dependent scaling factor ($\gamma$) on-the-fly from these raw statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and maximum activation). This $\gamma$ is then fused with the existing baseline score, multiplicatively modulating it -- an ``elastic scaling'' -- to push the ID and OOD distributions further apart. We demonstrate Catalyst is a generalizable framework: it seamlessly integrates with logit-based methods (e.g., Energy, ReAct, SCALE) and also provides a significant boost to distance-based detectors like KNN. As a result, Catalyst achieves substantial and consistent performance gains, reducing the average False Positive Rate by 32.87 on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18), 27.94% on CIFAR-100 (ResNet-18), and 22.25% on ImageNet (ResNet-50). Our results highlight the untapped potential of pre-pooling statistics and demonstrate that Catalyst is complementary to existing OOD detection approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02409v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Monte Carlo Tree Search for Makespan-Efficient Object Rearrangement in Cluttered Spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02411</link><description>arXiv:2602.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object rearrangement planning in complex, cluttered environments is a common challenge in warehouses, households, and rescue sites. Prior studies largely address monotone instances, whereas real-world tasks are often non-monotone-objects block one another and must be temporarily relocated to intermediate positions before reaching their final goals. In such settings, effective multi-agent collaboration can substantially reduce the time required to complete tasks. This paper introduces Centralized, Asynchronous, Multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (CAM-MCTS), a novel framework for general-purpose makespan-efficient object rearrangement planning in challenging environments. CAM-MCTS combines centralized task assignment-where agents remain aware of each other's intended actions to facilitate globally optimized planning-with an asynchronous task execution strategy that enables agents to take on new tasks at appropriate time steps, rather than waiting for others, guided by a one-step look-ahead cost estimate. This design minimizes idle time, prevents unnecessary synchronization delays, and enhances overall system efficiency. We evaluate CAM-MCTS across a diverse set of monotone and non-monotone tasks in cluttered environments, demonstrating consistent reductions in makespan compared to strong baselines. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world multi-agent system under different configurations, further confirming its effectiveness and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02411v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Provenance Verification of AI-Generated Images via a Perceptual Hash Registry Anchored on Blockchain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02412</link><description>arXiv:2602.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has made the generation of synthetic images widely accessible, increasing concerns related to misinformation, digital forgery, and content authenticity on large-scale online platforms. This paper proposes a blockchain-backed framework for verifying AI-generated images through a registry-based provenance mechanism. Each AI-generated image is assigned a digital fingerprint that preserves similarity using perceptual hashing and is registered at creation time by participating generation platforms. The hashes are stored on a hybrid on-chain/off-chain public blockchain using a Merkle Patricia Trie for tamper-resistant storage (on-chain) and a Burkhard-Keller tree (off-chain) to enable efficient similarity search over large image registries. Verification is performed when images are re-uploaded to digital platforms such as social media services, enabling identification of previously registered AI-generated images even after benign transformations or partial modifications. The proposed system does not aim to universally detect all synthetic images, but instead focuses on verifying the provenance of AI-generated content that has been registered at creation time. By design, this approach complements existing watermarking and learning-based detection methods, providing a platform-agnostic, tamper-proof mechanism for scalable content provenance and authenticity verification at the point of large-scale online distribution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02412v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Masked Autoencoders as Universal Speech Enhancer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02413</link><description>arXiv:2602.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised speech enhancement methods have been very successful. However, in practical scenarios, there is a lack of clean speech, and self-supervised learning-based (SSL) speech enhancement methods that offer comparable enhancement performance and can be applied to other speech-related downstream applications are desired. In this work, we develop a masked autoencoder based universal speech enhancer that is agnostic to the type of distortion affecting speech, can handle multiple distortions simultaneously, and is trained in a self-supervised manner. An augmentation stack adds further distortions to the noisy input data. The masked autoencoder model learns to remove the added distortions along with reconstructing the masked regions of the spectrogram during pre-training. The pre-trained embeddings are then used by fine-tuning models trained on a small amount of paired data for specific downstream tasks. We evaluate the pre-trained features for denoising and dereverberation downstream tasks. We explore different augmentations (like single or multi-speaker) in the pre-training augmentation stack and the effect of different noisy input feature representations (like $log1p$ compression) on pre-trained embeddings and downstream fine-tuning enhancement performance. We show that the proposed method not only outperforms the baseline but also achieves state-of-the-art performance for both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02413v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Misconception Diagnosis From Student-Tutor Dialogue: Generate, Retrieve, Rerank</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02414</link><description>arXiv:2602.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely and accurate identification of student misconceptions is key to improving learning outcomes and pre-empting the compounding of student errors. However, this task is highly dependent on the effort and intuition of the teacher. In this work, we present a novel approach for detecting misconceptions from student-tutor dialogues using large language models (LLMs). First, we use a fine-tuned LLM to generate plausible misconceptions, and then retrieve the most promising candidates among these using embedding similarity with the input dialogue. These candidates are then assessed and re-ranked by another fine-tuned LLM to improve misconception relevance. Empirically, we evaluate our system on real dialogues from an educational tutoring platform. We consider multiple base LLM models including LLaMA, Qwen and Claude on zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We find that our approach improves predictive performance over baseline models and that fine-tuning improves both generated misconception quality and can outperform larger closed-source models. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to both validate the importance of our generation and reranking steps on misconception generation quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02414v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active Transfer Bagging: A New Approach for Accelerated Active Learning Acquisition of Data by Combined Transfer Learning and Bagging Based Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02415</link><description>arXiv:2602.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning has achieved remarkable success on many problems, but this success often depends on the existence of large, labeled datasets. While active learning can dramatically reduce labeling cost when annotations are expensive, early performance is frequently dominated by the initial seed set, typically chosen at random. In many applications, however, related or approximate datasets are readily available and can be leveraged to construct a better seed set. We introduce a new method for selecting the seed data set for active learning, Active-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging). ATBagging estimates the informativeness of candidate data point from a Bayesian interpretation of bagged ensemble models by comparing in-bag and out-of-bag predictive distributions from the labeled dataset, yielding an information-gain proxy. To avoid redundant selections, we impose feature-space diversity by sampling a determinantal point process (DPP) whose kernel uses Random Fourier Features and a quality-diversity factorization that incorporates the informativeness scores. This same blended method is used for selection of new data points to collect during the active learning phase. We evaluate ATBagging on four real-world datasets covering both target-transfer and feature-shift scenarios (QM9, ERA5, Forbes 2000, and Beijing PM2.5). Across seed sizes nseed = 10-100, ATBagging improves or ties early active learning and increases area under the learning-curve relative to alternative seed subset selection methodologies in almost all cases, with strongest benefits in low-data regimes. Thus, ATBagging provides a low-cost, high reward means to initiating active learning-based data collection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structure Enables Effective Self-Localization of Errors in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02416</link><description>arXiv:2602.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-correction in language models remains elusive. In this work, we explore whether language models can explicitly localize errors in incorrect reasoning, as a path toward building AI systems that can effectively correct themselves. We introduce a prompting method that structures reasoning as discrete, semantically coherent thought steps, and show that models are able to reliably localize errors within this structure, while failing to do so in conventional, unstructured chain-of-thought reasoning. Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization. Upon verification, the model localizes the first erroneous step, and the system backtracks to generate alternative reasoning from the last correct point. When asked to correct reasoning verified as incorrect by an oracle, Thought-ICS achieves 20-40% self-correction lift. In a completely autonomous setting without external verification, it outperforms contemporary self-correction baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02416v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trust Region Continual Learning as an Implicit Meta-Learner</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02417</link><description>arXiv:2602.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning aims to acquire tasks sequentially without catastrophic forgetting, yet standard strategies face a core tradeoff: regularization-based methods (e.g., EWC) can overconstrain updates when task optima are weakly overlapping, while replay-based methods can retain performance but drift due to imperfect replay. We study a hybrid perspective: \emph{trust region continual learning} that combines generative replay with a Fisher-metric trust region constraint. We show that, under local approximations, the resulting update admits a MAML-style interpretation with a single implicit inner step: replay supplies an old-task gradient signal (query-like), while the Fisher-weighted penalty provides an efficient offline curvature shaping (support-like). This yields an emergent meta-learning property in continual learning: the model becomes an initialization that rapidly \emph{re-converges} to prior task optima after each task transition, without explicitly optimizing a bilevel objective. Empirically, on task-incremental diffusion image generation and continual diffusion-policy control, trust region continual learning achieves the best final performance and retention, and consistently recovers early-task performance faster than EWC, replay, and continual meta-learning baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02417v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SafeGround: Know When to Trust GUI Grounding Models via Uncertainty Calibration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02419</link><description>arXiv:2602.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding aims to translate natural language instructions into executable screen coordinates, enabling automated GUI interaction. Nevertheless, incorrect grounding can result in costly, hard-to-reverse actions (e.g., erroneous payment approvals), raising concerns about model reliability. In this paper, we introduce SafeGround, an uncertainty-aware framework for GUI grounding models that enables risk-aware predictions through calibrations before testing. SafeGround leverages a distribution-aware uncertainty quantification method to capture the spatial dispersion of stochastic samples from outputs of any given model. Then, through the calibration process, SafeGround derives a test-time decision threshold with statistically guaranteed false discovery rate (FDR) control. We apply SafeGround on multiple GUI grounding models for the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark. Experimental results show that our uncertainty measure consistently outperforms existing baselines in distinguishing correct from incorrect predictions, while the calibrated threshold reliably enables rigorous risk control and potentials of substantial system-level accuracy improvements. Across multiple GUI grounding models, SafeGround improves system-level accuracy by up to 5.38\% percentage points over Gemini-only inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02419v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Poly-attention: a general scheme for higher-order self-attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02422</link><description>arXiv:2602.02422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, at the heart of the Transformer model, is able to effectively model pairwise interactions between tokens. However, numerous recent works have shown that it is unable to perform basic tasks involving detecting triples of correlated tokens, or compositional tasks where multiple input tokens need to be referenced to generate a result. Some higher-dimensional alternatives to self-attention have been proposed to address this, including higher-order attention and Strassen attention, which can perform some of these polyadic tasks in exchange for slower, superquadratic running times.
  In this work, we define a vast class of generalizations of self-attention, which we call poly-attention mechanisms. Our mechanisms can incorporate arbitrary higher-order (tensor) computations as well as arbitrary relationship structures between the input tokens, and they include the aforementioned alternatives as special cases. We then systematically study their computational complexity and representational strength, including giving new algorithms and matching complexity-theoretic lower bounds on the time complexity of computing the attention matrix exactly as well as approximately, and tightly determining which polyadic tasks they can each perform. Our results give interesting trade-offs between different desiderata for these mechanisms, including a tight relationship between how expressive a mechanism is, and how large the coefficients in the model may be so that the mechanism can be approximated in almost-linear time.
  Notably, we give a new attention mechanism which can be computed exactly in quadratic time, and which can perform function composition for any fixed number of functions. Prior mechanisms, even for just composing two functions, could only be computed in superquadratic time, and our new lower bounds show that faster algorithms for them are not possible.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02422v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Repurposing Protein Language Models for Latent Flow-Based Fitness Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02425</link><description>arXiv:2602.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein fitness optimization is challenged by a vast combinatorial landscape where high-fitness variants are extremely sparse. Many current methods either underperform or require computationally expensive gradient-based sampling. We present CHASE, a framework that repurposes the evolutionary knowledge of pretrained protein language models by compressing their embeddings into a compact latent space. By training a conditional flow-matching model with classifier-free guidance, we enable the direct generation of high-fitness variants without predictor-based guidance during the ODE sampling steps. CHASE achieves state-of-the-art performance on AAV and GFP protein design benchmarks. Finally, we show that bootstrapping with synthetic data can further enhance performance in data-constrained settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02425v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SelvaMask: Segmenting Trees in Tropical Forests and Beyond</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02426</link><description>arXiv:2602.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical forests harbor most of the planet's tree biodiversity and are critical to global ecological balance. Canopy trees in particular play a disproportionate role in carbon storage and functioning of these ecosystems. Studying canopy trees at scale requires accurate delineation of individual tree crowns, typically performed using high-resolution aerial imagery. Despite advances in transformer-based models for individual tree crown segmentation, performance remains low in most forests, especially tropical ones. To this end, we introduce SelvaMask, a new tropical dataset containing over 8,800 manually delineated tree crowns across three Neotropical forest sites in Panama, Brazil, and Ecuador. SelvaMask features comprehensive annotations, including an inter-annotator agreement evaluation, capturing the dense structure of tropical forests and highlighting the difficulty of the task. Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a modular detection-segmentation pipeline that adapts vision foundation models (VFMs), using domain-specific detection-prompter. Our approach reaches state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both zero-shot generalist models and fully supervised end-to-end methods in dense tropical forests. We validate these gains on external tropical and temperate datasets, demonstrating that SelvaMask serves as both a challenging benchmark and a key enabler for generalized forest monitoring. Our code and dataset will be released publicly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02426v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Embedding Perturbation may Better Reflect the Uncertainty in LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02427</link><description>arXiv:2602.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs across diverse domains; however, they can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs. For responsible LLM application, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques are used to estimate a model's uncertainty about its outputs, indicating the likelihood that those outputs may be problematic. For LLM reasoning tasks, it is essential to estimate the uncertainty not only for the final answer, but also for the intermediate steps of the reasoning, as this can enable more fine-grained and targeted interventions. In this study, we explore what UQ metrics better reflect the LLM's ``intermediate uncertainty''during reasoning. Our study reveals that an LLMs' incorrect reasoning steps tend to contain tokens which are highly sensitive to the perturbations on the preceding token embeddings. In this way, incorrect (uncertain) intermediate steps can be readily identified using this sensitivity score as guidance in practice. In our experiments, we show such perturbation-based metric achieves stronger uncertainty quantification performance compared with baseline methods such as token (generation) probability and token entropy. Besides, different from approaches that rely on multiple sampling, the perturbation-based metrics offer better simplicity and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 3D Foundation Model-Based Loop Closing for Decentralized Collaborative SLAM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02430</link><description>arXiv:2602.02430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Collaborative Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (C-SLAM) techniques often struggle to identify map overlaps due to significant viewpoint variations among robots. Motivated by recent advancements in 3D foundation models, which can register images despite large viewpoint differences, we propose a robust loop closing approach that leverages these models to establish inter-robot measurements. In contrast to resource-intensive methods requiring full 3D reconstruction within a centralized map, our approach integrates foundation models into existing SLAM pipelines, yielding scalable and robust multi-robot mapping. Our contributions include: (1) integrating 3D foundation models to reliably estimate relative poses from monocular image pairs within decentralized C-SLAM; (2) introducing robust outlier mitigation techniques critical to the use of these relative poses; and (3) developing specialized pose graph optimization formulations that efficiently resolve scale ambiguities. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating improvements in localization and mapping accuracy, alongside significant gains in computational and memory efficiency. These results highlight the potential of our approach for deployment in large-scale multi-robot scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Maximizing Reliability with Bayesian Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02432</link><description>arXiv:2602.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular, sample-efficient technique for expensive, black-box optimization. One such problem arising in manufacturing is that of maximizing the reliability, or equivalently minimizing the probability of a failure, of a design which is subject to random perturbations - a problem that can involve extremely rare failures ($P_\mathrm{fail} = 10^{-6}-10^{-8}$). In this work, we propose two BO methods based on Thompson sampling and knowledge gradient, the latter approximating the one-step Bayes-optimal policy for minimizing the logarithm of the failure probability. Both methods incorporate importance sampling to target extremely small failure probabilities. Empirical results show the proposed methods outperform existing methods in both extreme and non-extreme regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02432v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Preemptive Scheduling for Age of Job Minimization in Task-Specific Machine Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02435</link><description>arXiv:2602.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system consisting of a central server, $N$ task-specific networks of machines, and multiple users. Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02435v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniReason 1.0: A Unified Reasoning Framework for World Knowledge Aligned Image Generation and Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02437</link><description>arXiv:2602.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models often struggle with complex synthesis tasks that demand deep reasoning, and typically treat text-to-image generation and image editing as isolated capabilities rather than interconnected reasoning steps. To address this, we propose UniReason, a unified framework that harmonizes these two tasks through a dual reasoning paradigm. We formulate generation as world knowledge-enhanced planning to inject implicit constraints, and leverage editing capabilities for fine-grained visual refinement to further correct visual errors via self-reflection. This approach unifies generation and editing within a shared representation, mirroring the human cognitive process of planning followed by refinement. We support this framework by systematically constructing a large-scale reasoning-centric dataset (~300k samples) covering five major knowledge domains (e.g., cultural commonsense, physics, etc.) for planning, alongside an agent-generated corpus for visual self-correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniReason achieves advanced performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as WISE, KrisBench and UniREditBench, while maintaining superior general synthesis capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02437v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] sVIRGO: A Scalable Virtual Tree Hierarchical Framework for Distributed Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02438</link><description>arXiv:2602.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose sVIRGO, a scalable virtual tree hierarchical framework for large-scale distributed systems. sVIRGO constructs virtual hierarchical trees directly on physical nodes, allowing each node to assume multiple hierarchical roles without overlay networks. The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer.
  Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur. Temporary drops below the minimum threshold do not compromise coordination, ensuring near-zero recovery latency, bounded communication overhead, and exponentially reduced failure probability while maintaining safety, liveness, and robustness under mobile, interference-prone, or adversarial conditions.
  Communication is decoupled from the hierarchy and may use multi-frequency wireless links. Two message hop strategies are supported: (i) with long-distance infrastructure-assisted channels, coordinators exploit the virtual tree to minimize hops; (ii) without such channels, messages propagate via adjacent regions.
  sVIRGO also supports Layer-Scoped Command Execution. Commands and coordination actions are executed within the scope of each hierarchical layer, enabling efficient local and regional decision-making while limiting unnecessary global propagation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computing for Edge AI: A Framework with Adaptive Spiking Neural Networks and Hardware-Aware Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02439</link><description>arXiv:2602.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge AI applications increasingly require ultra-low-power, low-latency inference. Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Models for Mental Health: A Multilingual Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02440</link><description>arXiv:2602.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks. However, their performance in multilingual contexts, especially within the mental health domain, has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we evaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs on eight mental health datasets in various languages, as well as their machine-translated (MT) counterparts. We compare LLM performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings against conventional NLP baselines that do not employ LLMs. In addition, we assess translation quality across language families and typologies to understand its influence on LLM performance. Proprietary LLMs and fine-tuned open-source LLMs achieve competitive F1 scores on several datasets, often surpassing state-of-the-art results. However, performance on MT data is generally lower, and the extent of this decline varies by language and typology. This variation highlights both the strengths of LLMs in handling mental health tasks in languages other than English and their limitations when translation quality introduces structural or lexical mismatches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Certain Head, Uncertain Tail: Expert-Sample for Test-Time Scaling in Fine-Grained MoE</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02443</link><description>arXiv:2602.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling improves LLM performance by generating multiple candidate solutions, yet token-level sampling requires temperature tuning that trades off diversity against stability. Fine-grained MoE, featuring hundreds of well-trained experts per layer and multi-expert activation per token, offers an unexplored alternative through its rich routing space. We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates. While single-run greedy accuracy remains stable when fewer experts are activated, multi-sample pass@n degrades significantly-suggesting that the certain head governs core reasoning capability while the uncertain tail correlates with reasoning diversity. Motivated by these findings, we propose Expert-Sample, a training-free method that preserves high-confidence selections while injecting controlled stochasticity into the uncertain tail, enabling diverse generation without destabilizing outputs. Evaluated on multiple fine-grained MoE models across math, knowledge reasoning, and code tasks, Expert-Sample consistently improves pass@n and verification-based accuracy. On Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct evaluated on GPQA-Diamond with 32 parallel samples, pass@32 rises from 85.4% to 91.9%, and accuracy improves from 59.1% to 62.6% with Best-of-N verification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02443v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RANKVIDEO: Reasoning Reranking for Text-to-Video Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02444</link><description>arXiv:2602.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reranking is a critical component of modern retrieval systems, which typically pair an efficient first-stage retriever with a more expressive model to refine results. While large reasoning models have driven rapid progress in text-centric reranking, reasoning-based reranking for video retrieval remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce RANKVIDEO, a reasoning-based reranker for video retrieval that explicitly reasons over query-video pairs using video content to assess relevance. RANKVIDEO is trained using a two-stage curriculum consisting of perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training that combines pointwise, pairwise, and teacher confidence distillation objectives, and is supported by a data synthesis pipeline for constructing reasoning-intensive query-video pairs. Experiments on the large-scale MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark demonstrate that RANKVIDEO consistently improves retrieval performance within a two-stage framework, yielding an average improvement of 31% on nDCG@10 and outperforming text-only and vision-language reranking alternatives, while more efficient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02444v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finite-Sample Wasserstein Error Bounds and Concentration Inequalities for Nonlinear Stochastic Approximation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02445</link><description>arXiv:2602.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives non-asymptotic error bounds for nonlinear stochastic approximation algorithms in the Wasserstein-$p$ distance. To obtain explicit finite-sample guarantees for the last iterate, we develop a coupling argument that compares the discrete-time process to a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analysis applies to algorithms driven by general noise conditions, including martingale differences and functions of ergodic Markov chains. Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting.
  Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $\gamma_n^{1/6}$, where $\gamma_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$. These distributional guarantees imply high-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon those derived from moment bounds and Markov's inequality. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by considering two applications: (1) linear stochastic approximation, where we explicitly quantify the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior of the iterates, thereby bridging the gap between recent finite-sample analyses and asymptotic theory and (2) stochastic gradient descent, where we establish rate of convergence to the central limit theorem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE): Learning Intervention Strategies via Direct Preference Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02451</link><description>arXiv:2602.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering causal relationships requires controlled experiments, but experimentalists face a sequential decision problem: each intervention reveals information that should inform what to try next. Traditional approaches such as random sampling, greedy information maximization, and round-robin coverage treat each decision in isolation, unable to learn adaptive strategies from experience. We propose Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), which learns experimental design as a sequential policy. Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2). Notably, the learned policy autonomously discovers that collider mechanisms require concentrated interventions on parent variables, a theoretically-grounded strategy that emerges purely from experience. This suggests preference-based learning can recover principled experimental strategies, complementing theory with learned domain adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02451v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Safety-Critical Control of Networked SIR Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02452</link><description>arXiv:2602.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust safety-critical control framework tailored for networked susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic dynamics, leveraging control barrier functions (CBFs) and robust control barrier functions to address the challenges of epidemic spread and mitigation. In our networked SIR model, each node must keep its infection level below a critical threshold, despite dynamic interactions with neighboring nodes and inherent uncertainties in the epidemic parameters and measurement errors, to ensure public health safety. We first derive a CBF-based controller that guarantees infection thresholds are not exceeded in the nominal case. We enhance the framework to handle realistic epidemic scenarios under uncertainties by incorporating compensation terms that reinforce safety against uncertainties: an independent method with constant bounds for uniform uncertainty, and a novel approach that scales with the state to capture increased relative noise in early or suppressed outbreak stages. Simulation results on a networked SIR system illustrate that the nominal CBF controller maintains safety under low uncertainty, while the robust approaches provide formal safety guarantees under higher uncertainties; in particular, the novel method employs more conservative control efforts to provide larger safety margins, whereas the independent approach optimizes resource allocation by allowing infection levels to approach the boundaries in steady epidemic regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02452v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thinking with Comics: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning through Structured Visual Storytelling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02453</link><description>arXiv:2602.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has driven large language models to extend from thinking with text to thinking with images and videos. However, different modalities still have clear limitations: static images struggle to represent temporal structure, while videos introduce substantial redundancy and computational cost. In this work, we propose Thinking with Comics, a visual reasoning paradigm that uses comics as a high information-density medium positioned between images and videos. Comics preserve temporal structure, embedded text, and narrative coherence while requiring significantly lower reasoning cost. We systematically study two reasoning paths based on comics and evaluate them on a range of reasoning tasks and long-context understanding tasks. Experimental results show that Thinking with Comics outperforms Thinking with Images on multi-step temporal and causal reasoning tasks, while remaining substantially more efficient than Thinking with Video. Further analysis indicates that different comic narrative structures and styles consistently affect performance across tasks, suggesting that comics serve as an effective intermediate visual representation for improving multimodal reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02453v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] World-Gymnast: Training Robots with Reinforcement Learning in a World Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02454</link><description>arXiv:2602.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot learning from interacting with the physical world is fundamentally bottlenecked by the cost of physical interaction. The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02454v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Drift-Bench: Diagnosing Cooperative Breakdowns in LLM Agents under Input Faults via Multi-Turn Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02455</link><description>arXiv:2602.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models transition to autonomous agents, user inputs frequently violate cooperative assumptions (e.g., implicit intent, missing parameters, false presuppositions, or ambiguous expressions), creating execution risks that text-only evaluations do not capture. Existing benchmarks typically assume well-specified instructions or restrict evaluation to text-only, single-turn clarification, and thus do not measure multi-turn disambiguation under grounded execution risk. We introduce \textbf{Drift-Bench}, the first diagnostic benchmark that evaluates agentic pragmatics under input faults through multi-turn clarification across state-oriented and service-oriented execution environments. Grounded in classical theories of communication, \textbf{Drift-Bench} provides a unified taxonomy of cooperative breakdowns and employs a persona-driven user simulator with the \textbf{Rise} evaluation protocol. Experiments show substantial performance drops under these faults, with clarification effectiveness varying across user personas and fault types. \MethodName bridges clarification research and agent safety evaluation, enabling systematic diagnosis of failures that can lead to unsafe executions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02455v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Relationship-Aware Hierarchical 3D Scene Graph for Task Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02456</link><description>arXiv:2602.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing and understanding 3D environments in a structured manner is crucial for autonomous agents to navigate and reason about their surroundings. While traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generate metric reconstructions and can be extended to metric-semantic mapping, they lack a higher level of abstraction and relational reasoning. To address this gap, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful representation for capturing hierarchical structures and object relationships. In this work, we propose an enhanced hierarchical 3D scene graph that integrates open-vocabulary features across multiple abstraction levels and supports object-relational reasoning. Our approach leverages a Vision Language Model (VLM) to infer semantic relationships. Notably, we introduce a task reasoning module that combines Large Language Models (LLM) and a VLM to interpret the scene graph's semantic and relational information, enabling agents to reason about tasks and interact with their environment more intelligently. We validate our method by deploying it on a quadruped robot in multiple environments and tasks, highlighting its ability to reason about them.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02456v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MetaCLASS: Metacognitive Coaching for Learning with Adaptive Self-regulation Support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02457</link><description>arXiv:2602.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models can generate fluent explanations, but effective tutoring requires supporting the learner's thought process, not just delivering content. Metacognitive tutoring targets this gap by prompting planning, monitoring, debugging, and evaluation, and crucially, deciding when to be active versus minimally present, based on learner signals and trajectory. We introduce MetaCLASS, a learning-science grounded framework that formulates metacognitive tutoring as move selection over 11 interpretable actions aligned to self-regulated learning processes. MetaCLASS uses a two-phase framework that first plans a pedagogical trajectory conditioned on learner profiles (calibration, help-seeking) and then generates natural dialogue consistent with that plan. This yields a dataset of 1,015 conversations (7,711 turns) annotated with turn-level metacognitive labels, and validated for pedagogical contingency and trajectory adherence. We benchmark nine LLMs on predicting the next coach move given the problem and dialogue context. The best model achieves only 43.2\% accuracy, and models exhibit compulsive intervention bias: in turns where effective metacognitive tutoring requires silent (41.7\% of cases), models predict `no intervention' only 4.2\% of the time, while severely over-predicting high-intervention moves. These results show that traditional content-based tutoring ability does not translate to metacognitive tutoring competence, positioning MetaCLASS as a testbed for developing intelligent tutors that promote self-regulated learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02457v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conflict-Aware Client Selection for Multi-Server Federated Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02458</link><description>arXiv:2602.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed machine learning (ML) that enables collaborative model training across clients without exposing raw data, thereby preserving user privacy and reducing communication costs. Despite these benefits, traditional single-server FL suffers from high communication latency due to the aggregation of models from a large number of clients. While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RL-CRP framework effectively reduces inter-server conflicts and significantly improves training efficiency in terms of convergence speed and communication cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02458v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TIC-VLA: A Think-in-Control Vision-Language-Action Model for Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02459</link><description>arXiv:2602.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots in dynamic, human-centric environments must follow language instructions while maintaining real-time reactive control. Vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with deductive judgment in syllogistic reasoning, systematically conflating semantic plausibility with formal validity a phenomenon known as content effect. This bias persists even when models generate step-wise explanations, indicating that intermediate rationales may inherit the same semantic shortcuts that affect answers. Recent approaches propose mitigating this issue by increasing inference-time structural constraints, either by encouraging abstract intermediate representations or by intervening directly in the model's internal computations; however, reliably suppressing semantic interference remains an open challenge. To make formal deduction less sensitive to semantic content, we introduce a framework for abstraction-guided reasoning that explicitly separates structural inference from lexical semantics. We construct paired content-laden and abstract syllogisms and use the model's activations on abstract inputs to define an abstract reasoning space. We then learn lightweight Abstractors that, from content-conditioned residual-stream states, predict representations aligned with this space and integrate these predictions via multi-layer interventions during the forward pass. Using cross-lingual transfer as a test bed, we show that abstraction-aligned steering reduces content-driven errors and improves validity-sensitive performance. Our results position activation-level abstraction as a scalable mechanism for enhancing the robustness of formal reasoning in LLMs against semantic interference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02462v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Directions to Regions: Decomposing Activations in Language Models via Local Geometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02464</link><description>arXiv:2602.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation decomposition methods in language models are tightly coupled to geometric assumptions on how concepts are realized in activation space. Existing approaches search for individual global directions, implicitly assuming linear separability, which overlooks concepts with nonlinear or multi-dimensional structure. In this work, we leverage Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) as a scalable, unsupervised alternative that models the activation space as a collection of Gaussian regions with their local covariance structure. MFA decomposes activations into two compositional geometric objects: the region's centroid in activation space, and the local variation from the centroid. We train large-scale MFAs for Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B, and show they capture complex, nonlinear structures in activation space. Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as a promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02464v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MentisOculi: Revealing the Limits of Reasoning with Mental Imagery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02465</link><description>arXiv:2602.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier models are transitioning from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that merely ingest visual information to unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of native interleaved generation. This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning. MentisOculi establishes the necessary foundation to analyze and close this gap across diverse model families.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02465v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Indications of Belief-Guided Agency and Meta-Cognitive Monitoring in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02467</link><description>arXiv:2602.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked the question whether these models possess some form of consciousness. To tackle this challenge, Butlin et al. (2023) introduced a list of indicators for consciousness in artificial systems based on neuroscientific theories. In this work, we evaluate a key indicator from this list, called HOT-3, which tests for agency guided by a general belief-formation and action selection system that updates beliefs based on meta-cognitive monitoring. We view beliefs as representations in the model's latent space that emerge in response to a given input, and introduce a metric to quantify their dominance during generation. Analyzing the dynamics between competing beliefs across models and tasks reveals three key findings: (1) external manipulations systematically modulate internal belief formation, (2) belief formation causally drives the model's action selection, and (3) models can monitor and report their own belief states. Together, these results provide empirical support for the existence of belief-guided agency and meta-cognitive monitoring in LLMs. More broadly, our work lays methodological groundwork for investigating the emergence of agency, beliefs, and meta-cognition in LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02467v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Avenir-Web: Human-Experience-Imitating Multimodal Web Agents with Mixture of Grounding Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02468</link><description>arXiv:2602.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in multimodal large language models, autonomous web agents still struggle to reliably execute long-horizon tasks on complex and dynamic web interfaces. Existing agents often suffer from inaccurate element grounding, the absence of site-specific procedural knowledge, and unstable long-term task tracking and memory, particularly when operating over complex Document Object Model structures.

Avenir-Web leverages a Mixture of Grounding Experts, Experience-Imitation Planning for incorporating procedural priors, and a task-tracking checklist combined with adaptive memory to enable robust and seamless interaction across diverse user interface paradigms. We evaluate Avenir-Web on Online-Mind2Web, a rigorous benchmark of live and user-centered web tasks. Our results demonstrate that Avenir-Web significantly surpasses prior open-source agents and attains performance parity with top-tier proprietary models, thereby establishing a new open-source state of the art for reliable web agents on live websites.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02468v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking the Reversal Curse in Autoregressive Language Models via Identity Bridge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02470</link><description>arXiv:2602.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many complex tasks, yet they can still fail in very simple logical reasoning such as the "reversal curse" -- when trained on forward knowledge data of the form "$A \rightarrow B$" (e.g., Alice's husband is Bob), the model is unable to deduce the reversal knowledge "$B \leftarrow A$" (e.g., Bob's wife is Alice) during test. Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form "$A \to A$" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data. Our work provides a novel theoretical foundation for the reversal curse and offers a principled, low-cost path to encouraging LLMs to learn higher-level rules from data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02470v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-head automated segmentation by incorporating detection head into the contextual layer neural network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02471</link><description>arXiv:2602.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning based auto segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy, but conventional models often produce anatomically implausible false positives, or hallucinations, in slices lacking target structures. We propose a gated multi-head Transformer architecture based on Swin U-Net, augmented with inter-slice context integration and a parallel detection head, which jointly performs slice-level structure detection via a multi-layer perceptron and pixel-level segmentation through a context-enhanced stream. Detection outputs gate the segmentation predictions to suppress false positives in anatomically invalid slices, and training uses slice-wise Tversky loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Prostate-Anatomical-Edge-Cases dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive demonstrate that the gated model substantially outperforms a non-gated segmentation-only baseline, achieving a mean Dice loss of $0.013 \pm 0.036$ versus $0.732 \pm 0.314$, with detection probabilities strongly correlated with anatomical presence, effectively eliminating spurious segmentations. In contrast, the non-gated model exhibited higher variability and persistent false positives across all slices. These results indicate that detection-based gating enhances robustness and anatomical plausibility in automated segmentation applications, reducing hallucinated predictions without compromising segmentation quality in valid slices, and offers a promising approach for improving the reliability of clinical radiotherapy auto-contouring workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HumanX: Toward Agile and Generalizable Humanoid Interaction Skills from Human Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02473</link><description>arXiv:2602.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to perform agile and adaptive interactive tasks has long been a core challenge in robotics. Current approaches are bottlenecked by either the scarcity of realistic interaction data or the need for meticulous, task-specific reward engineering, which limits their scalability. To narrow this gap, we present HumanX, a full-stack framework that compiles human video into generalizable, real-world interaction skills for humanoids, without task-specific rewards. HumanX integrates two co-designed components: XGen, a data generation pipeline that synthesizes diverse and physically plausible robot interaction data from video while supporting scalable data augmentation; and XMimic, a unified imitation learning framework that learns generalizable interaction skills. Evaluated across five distinct domains--basketball, football, badminton, cargo pickup, and reactive fighting--HumanX successfully acquires 10 different skills and transfers them zero-shot to a physical Unitree G1 humanoid. The learned capabilities include complex maneuvers such as pump-fake turnaround fadeaway jumpshots without any external perception, as well as interactive tasks like sustained human-robot passing sequences over 10 consecutive cycles--learned from a single video demonstration. Our experiments show that HumanX achieves over 8 times higher generalization success than prior methods, demonstrating a scalable and task-agnostic pathway for learning versatile, real-world robot interactive skills.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02473v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MemSkill: Learning and Evolving Memory Skills for Self-Evolving Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02474</link><description>arXiv:2602.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Large Language Model (LLM) agent memory systems rely on a small set of static, hand-designed operations for extracting memory. These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present \textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02474v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgentRx: Diagnosing AI Agent Failures from Execution Trajectories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02475</link><description>arXiv:2602.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents often fail in ways that are difficult to localize because executions are probabilistic, long-horizon, multi-agent, and mediated by noisy tool outputs. We address this gap by manually annotating failed agent runs and release a novel benchmark of 115 failed trajectories spanning structured API workflows, incident management, and open-ended web/file tasks. Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category. Our framework improves step localization and failure attribution over existing baselines across three domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02475v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training LLMs for Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning Elevates Test-Time Scalability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02477</link><description>arXiv:2602.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Nevertheless, at the limits of model capability, CoT often proves insufficient, and its strictly sequential nature constrains test-time scalability. A potential alternative is divide-and-conquer (DAC) reasoning, which decomposes a complex problem into subproblems to facilitate more effective exploration of the solution. Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training. Under comparable training, our DAC-style framework endows the model with a higher performance ceiling and stronger test-time scalability, surpassing CoT by 8.6% in Pass@1 and 6.3% in Pass@32 on competition-level benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02477v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Motivation, Attention, and Visual Platform Design: How Moral Contagions Spread on TikTok and Instagram in the 2024 United States Presidential Election</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02479</link><description>arXiv:2602.02479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual social media platforms have become primary venues for political discourse, yet we know little about how moralization operates differently across platforms and topics. Analyzing 2,027,595 TikToks and 1,126,972 Instagram posts during the 2024 US presidential election, we demonstrate that issues are not necessarily inherently moralized, but a product of audience demographics, platform architecture, and partisan framing. Using temporal supply-demand analysis and moral foundations scoring (eMFD), we examine the dynamics of key electoral issues. Three key findings emerge. First, moralization patterns diverge dramatically by platform: TikTok's algorithm enabled viral spread of moralized abortion and immigration content despite lower supply, while Instagram amplified economic discourse that aligned supply and demand. Second, traditionally "pragmatic" economic issues became moralized-cryptocurrency discourse invoked loyalty and authority foundations more strongly than any other topic, framing regulation as government overreach. Third, platforms responded to different events: TikTok surged after Harris's nomination across all topics (96% reduction in supply volatility), while Instagram spiked around cryptocurrency policy developments. Semantic network analysis reveals TikTok's circular topology enables cross-cutting exposure while Instagram's fragmented structure isolates Harris from economic discourse. These findings demonstrate that understanding political moralization requires examining platform-specific ecosystems where architecture, demographics, and content strategy interact to determine which issues get moralized and how moral content spreads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Flow Policy Gradients for Robot Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02481</link><description>arXiv:2602.02481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Likelihood-based policy gradient methods are the dominant approach for training robot control policies from rewards. These methods rely on differentiable action likelihoods, which constrain policy outputs to simple distributions like Gaussians. In this work, we show how flow matching policy gradients -- a recent framework that bypasses likelihood computation -- can be made effective for training and fine-tuning more expressive policies in challenging robot control settings. We introduce an improved objective that enables success in legged locomotion, humanoid motion tracking, and manipulation tasks, as well as robust sim-to-real transfer on two humanoid robots. We then present ablations and analysis on training dynamics.

Abstract: The success of RL for LLM post-training stems from an unreasonably uninformative source: a single bit of information per rollout as binary reward or preference label. At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02482v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RE-TRAC: REcursive TRAjectory Compression for Deep Search Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02486</link><description>arXiv:2602.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based deep research agents are largely built on the ReAct framework. This linear design makes it difficult to revisit earlier states, branch into alternative search directions, or maintain global awareness under long contexts, often leading to local optima, redundant exploration, and inefficient search. We propose Re-TRAC, an agentic framework that performs cross-trajectory exploration by generating a structured state representation after each trajectory to summarize evidence, uncertainties, failures, and future plans, and conditioning subsequent trajectories on this state representation. This enables iterative reflection and globally informed planning, reframing research as a progressive process. Empirical results show that Re-TRAC consistently outperforms ReAct by 15-20% on BrowseComp with frontier LLMs. For smaller models, we introduce Re-TRAC-aware supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales. Notably, Re-TRAC shows a monotonic reduction in tool calls and token usage across rounds, indicating progressively targeted exploration driven by cross-trajectory reflection rather than redundant search.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02486v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Carry-Over Lottery Allocation: Practical Incentive-Compatible Drafts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02487</link><description>arXiv:2602.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NBA Draft lottery is designed to promote competitive balance by awarding better draft positions to weaker teams, but it creates incentives to deliberately lose, a practice known as tanking. We propose a draft mechanism that is simultaneously practical, incentive-compatible, and advantages weaker teams. The \textbf{Carry-Over Lottery Allocation (COLA) Draft Mechanism} represents a paradigm shift in evaluating team quality, replacing a single season's standings with playoff outcomes over multiple years. COLA uses a draft lottery where every non-playoff team receives the same number of lottery tickets, removing incentives to lose additional games after elimination. Lottery tickets that do not win a top draft pick carry over to future lotteries, while playoff success or winning a top pick diminishes a team's accumulated tickets. Over time, COLA rewards teams with poor long-term performance and less prior draft assistance. By retaining the lottery format, COLA preserves transparency and fan engagement.
  Real-world implementation challenges are addressed to demonstrate feasibility, including transitioning from the current system, handling traded draft picks, and accommodating draft classes of varying strength. The most significant challenge occurs in years with exceptionally strong draft classes, where teams may prefer missing the playoffs in order to gain lottery access, violating a foundational assumption: that teams prefer playoff success to lottery participation. We provide a solution to this problem, employing a truth-elicitation mechanism to identify such years and expand lottery eligibility to include as many playoff teams as necessary to preserve anti-tanking incentives.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02487v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RLAnything: Forge Environment, Policy, and Reward Model in Completely Dynamic RL System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02488</link><description>arXiv:2602.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose RLAnything, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically forges environment, policy, and reward models through closed-loop optimization, amplifying learning signals and strengthening the overall RL system for any LLM or agentic scenarios. Specifically, the policy is trained with integrated feedback from step-wise and outcome signals, while the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback, which in turn further improves policy training. Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively.

Abstract: The introduction of the new multi-user linearly-separable distributed computing framework, has recently revealed how a parallel treatment of users can yield large parallelization gains with relatively low computation and communication costs. These gains stem from a new approach that converts the computing problem into a sparse matrix factorization problem; a matrix $F$ that describes the users' requests, is decomposed as \(F = DE\), where a \(\gamma\)-sparse \(E\) defines the task allocation across $N$ servers, and a \(\delta\)-sparse \(D\) defines the connectivity between \(N\) servers and \(K\) users as well as the decoding process. While this approach provides near-optimal performance, its linear nature has raised data secrecy concerns.
  We here adopt an information-theoretic secrecy framework, seeking guarantees that each user can learn nothing more than its own requested function. In this context, our main result provides two necessary and sufficient secrecy criteria; (i) for each user \(k\) who observes $\alpha_k$ server responses, the common randomness visible to that user must span a subspace of dimension exactly $\alpha_k-1$,
  and (ii) for each user, removing from \(\mathbf{D}\) the columns corresponding to the servers it observes must leave a matrix of rank at least \(K-1\). With these conditions in place, we design a general scheme -- that applies to finite and non-finite fields alike -- which is based on appending to \(\mathbf{E}\) a basis of \(\mathrm{Null}(\mathbf{D})\) and by carefully injecting shared randomness. In many cases, this entails no additional costs. The scheme, while maintaining performance, guarantees perfect information-theoretic secrecy in the case of finite fields, while in the real case, the conditions yield an explicit mutual-information bound that can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the variance of Gaussian common randomness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02489v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PixelGen: Pixel Diffusion Beats Latent Diffusion with Perceptual Loss</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02493</link><description>arXiv:2602.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel diffusion generates images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end manner, avoiding the artifacts and bottlenecks introduced by VAEs in two-stage latent diffusion. However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm.

Abstract: Clinical brain-to-text interfaces are designed for paralysed patients who cannot provide extensive training recordings. Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.

Abstract: Direct alignment methods are increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02495v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A differentiation formula, with application to the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5402</link><description>arXiv:1410.5402v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can help fight pandemics like COVID-19 by enabling rapid screening of large volumes of images. To perform data analysis while maintaining patient privacy, we create ML models that satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Previous works exploring private COVID-19 models are in part based on small datasets, provide weaker or unclear privacy guarantees, and do not investigate practical privacy. We suggest improvements to address these open gaps. We account for inherent class imbalances and evaluate the utility-privacy trade-off more extensively and over stricter privacy budgets. Our evaluation is supported by empirically estimating practical privacy through black-box Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). The introduced DP should help limit leakage threats posed by MIAs, and our practical analysis is the first to test this hypothesis on the COVID-19 classification task. Our results indicate that needed privacy levels might differ based on the task-dependent practical threat from MIAs. The results further suggest that with increasing DP guarantees, empirical privacy leakage only improves marginally, and DP therefore appears to have a limited impact on practical MIA defense. Our findings identify possibilities for better utility-privacy trade-offs, and we believe that empirical attack-specific privacy estimation can play a vital role in tuning for practical privacy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2211.11434v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generating Synthetic Health Sensor Data for Privacy-Preserving Wearable Stress Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13327</link><description>arXiv:2401.13327v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smartwatch health sensor data are increasingly utilized in smart health applications and patient monitoring, including stress detection. However, such medical data often comprise sensitive personal information and are resource-intensive to acquire for research purposes. In response to this challenge, we introduce the privacy-aware synthetization of multi-sensor smartwatch health readings related to moments of stress, employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Differential Privacy (DP) safeguards. Our method not only protects patient information but also enhances data availability for research. To ensure its usefulness, we test synthetic data from multiple GANs and employ different data enhancement strategies on an actual stress detection task. Our GAN-based augmentation methods demonstrate significant improvements in model performance, with private DP training scenarios observing an 11.90-15.48% increase in F1-score, while non-private training scenarios still see a 0.45% boost. These results underline the potential of differentially private synthetic data in optimizing utility-privacy trade-offs, especially with the limited availability of real training samples. Through rigorous quality assessments, we confirm the integrity and plausibility of our synthetic data, which, however, are significantly impacted when increasing privacy requirements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2401.13327v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing the Impact of Image Dataset Features on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01329</link><description>arXiv:2409.01329v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is crucial in many sectors, including computer vision. However, ML models trained on sensitive data face security challenges, as they can be attacked and leak information. Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) addresses this by using Differential Privacy (DP) to balance utility and privacy. This study identifies image dataset characteristics that affect the utility and vulnerability of private and non-private Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Through analyzing multiple datasets and privacy budgets, we find that imbalanced datasets increase vulnerability in minority classes, but DP mitigates this issue. Datasets with fewer classes improve both model utility and privacy, while high entropy or low Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) datasets deteriorate the utility-privacy trade-off. These insights offer valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers in estimating and optimizing the utility-privacy trade-off in image datasets, helping to inform data and privacy modifications for better outcomes based on dataset characteristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.01329v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Learning With Individualized Privacy Through Client Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17634</link><description>arXiv:2501.17634v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With growing concerns about user data collection, individualized privacy has emerged as a promising solution to balance protection and utility by accounting for diverse user privacy preferences. Instead of enforcing a uniform level of anonymization for all users, this approach allows individuals to choose privacy settings that align with their comfort levels. Building on this idea, we propose an adapted method for enabling Individualized Differential Privacy (IDP) in Federated Learning (FL) by handling clients according to their personal privacy preferences. By extending the SAMPLE algorithm from centralized settings to FL, we calculate client-specific sampling rates based on their heterogeneous privacy budgets and integrate them into a modified IDP-FedAvg algorithm. We test this method under realistic privacy distributions and multiple datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves clear improvements over uniform DP baselines, reducing the trade-off between privacy and utility. Compared to the alternative SCALE method in related work, which assigns differing noise scales to clients, our method performs notably better. However, challenges remain for complex tasks with non-i.i.d. data, primarily stemming from the constraints of the decentralized setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.17634v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning via Conservative Agent for Environments with Random Delays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18992</link><description>arXiv:2507.18992v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent. This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.18992v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21934</link><description>arXiv:2507.21934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.21934v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AutoBinder Agent: An MCP-Based Agent for End-to-End Protein Binder Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00019</link><description>arXiv:2602.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern AI technologies for drug discovery are distributed across heterogeneous platforms-including web applications, desktop environments, and code libraries-leading to fragmented workflows, inconsistent interfaces, and high integration overhead. We present an agentic end-to-end drug design framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to dynamically coordinate access to biochemical databases, modular toolchains, and task-specific AI models. The system integrates four state-of-the-art components: MaSIF (MaSIF-site and MaSIF-seed-search) for geometric deep learning-based identification of protein-protein interaction (PPI) sites, Rosetta for grafting protein fragments onto protein backbones to form mini proteins, ProteinMPNN for amino acid sequences redesign, and AlphaFold3 for near-experimental accuracy in complex structure prediction. Starting from a target structure, the framework supports de novo binder generation via surface analysis, scaffold grafting and pose construction, sequence optimization, and structure prediction. Additionally, by replacing rigid, script-based workflows with a protocol-driven, LLM-coordinated architecture, the framework improves reproducibility, reduces manual overhead, and ensures extensibility, portability, and auditability across the entire drug design process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QSPE: Enumerating Skeletal Quantum Programs for Quantum Library Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00024</link><description>arXiv:2602.00024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing has led to the development of various quantum libraries, empowering compilation, simulation, and hardware backend interfaces. However, ensuring the correctness of these libraries remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of mature testing methodologies. The state-of-the-art tools often rely on domain-specific configurations and expert knowledge, which limits their accessibility and scalability in practice. Furthermore, although these tools demonstrate strong performance, they adopt measurement-based for output validation in testing, which makes them produce false positive reports.
  To alleviate these limitations, we propose QSPE, a practical approach that follows the differential testing principle and extends the existing approach, SPE, for quantum libraries. QSPE is fully automated, requiring no pre-set configurations or domain expertise, and can effectively generate a large set of diverse program variants that comprehensively explore the quantum compilation space. To mitigate the possible false positive reports, we propose statevector-based validation as an alternative to measurement-based validation. In our experiments, the QSPE approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in generating 22,770 program variants across multiple quantum computing platforms. By avoiding $\alpha$-equivalence at the quantum and classical program wise, QSPE can reduce redundant generation and save more than 90\% of execution cost. Finally, the statevector-based validation method assists QSPE to reduce false alarms and effectively detects 708 miscompilations across multiple quantum libraries. Notably, 81 of the discovered bugs have been officially approved and acknowledged by the Qiskit development team, demonstrating the practical impact of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00024v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LOGOS-CA: A Cellular Automaton Using Natural Language as State and Rule</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00036</link><description>arXiv:2602.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained solely on massive text data, have achieved high performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a benchmark proposed to measure commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities about the real world. This suggests that the language produced by humanity describes a significant portion of the world with considerable nuance. In this study, we attempt to harness the high expressive power of language within cellular automata. Specifically, we express cell states and rules in natural language and delegate their updates to an LLM. Through this approach, cellular automata can transcend the constraints of merely numerical states and fixed rules, providing us with a richer platform for simulation. Here, we propose LOGOS-CA (Language Oriented Grid Of Statements - Cellular Automaton) as a natural framework to achieve this and examine its capabilities. We confirmed that LOGOS-CA successfully performs simple forest fire simulations and also serves as an intriguing subject for investigation from an Artificial Life (ALife) perspective. In this paper, we report the results of these experiments and discuss directions for future research using LOGOS-CA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning and Combinatorial Fusion Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00037</link><description>arXiv:2602.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to apply a new model fusion and learning paradigm, known as Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), to the field of Bitcoin price prediction. Price prediction of financial product has always been a big topic in finance, as the successful prediction of the price can yield significant profit. Every machine learning model has its own strength and weakness, which hinders progress toward robustness. CFA has been used to enhance models by leveraging rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity in the combination of a moderate set of diverse and relatively well-performed models. Our method utilizes both score and rank combinations as well as other weighted combination techniques. Key metrics such as RMSE and MAPE are used to evaluate our methodology performance. Our proposal presents a notable MAPE performance of 0.19\%. The proposed method greatly improves upon individual model performance, as well as outperforms other Bitcoin price prediction models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] JSR-GFNet: Jamming-to-Signal Ratio-Aware Dynamic Gating for Interference Classification in future Cognitive Global Navigation Satellite Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00042</link><description>arXiv:2602.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition toward cognitive global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers requires accurate interference classification to trigger adaptive mitigation strategies. However, conventional methods relying on Time-Frequency Analysis (TFA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face two fundamental limitations: severe performance degradation in low Jamming-to-Signal Ratio (JSR) regimes due to noise obscuration, and ``feature degeneracy'' caused by the loss of phase information in magnitude-only spectrograms. Consequently, spectrally similar signals -- such as high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation versus Band-Limited Gaussian Noise -- become indistinguishable. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the \textbf{JSR-Guided Fusion Network (JSR-GFNet)}. This multi-modal architecture combines phase-sensitive complex In-Phase/Quadrature (IQ) samples with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms. Central to this framework is a physics-inspired dynamic gating mechanism driven by statistical signal descriptors. Acting as a conditional controller, it autonomously estimates signal reliability to dynamically reweight the contributions of a Complex-Valued ResNet (IQ stream) and an EfficientNet backbone (STFT stream). To validate the model, we introduce the Comprehensive GNSS Interference (CGI-21) dataset, simulating 21 jamming categories including software-defined waveforms from aerial platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JSR-GFNet achieves higher accuracy across the full 10--50 dB JSR spectrum. Notably, interpretability analysis confirms that the model learns a physically intuitive strategy: prioritizing spectral energy integration in noise-limited regimes while shifting focus to phase precision in high-SNR scenarios to resolve modulation ambiguities. This framework provides a robust solution for next-generation aerospace navigation security.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Circuit-Based Learning Models: Bridging Quantum Computing and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00048</link><description>arXiv:2602.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has been widely applied across numerous domains due to its ability to automatically identify informative patterns from data for various tasks. The availability of large-scale data and advanced computational power enables the development of sophisticated models and training strategies, leading to state-of-the-art performance, but it also introduces substantial challenges. Quantum Computing (QC), which exploits quantum mechanisms for computation, has attracted growing attention and significant global investment as it may address these challenges. Consequently, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the integration of these two fields, has received increasing interest, with a notable rise in related studies in recent years. We are motivated to review these existing contributions regarding quantum circuit-based learning models for classical data analysis and highlight the identified potentials and challenges of this technique. Specifically, we focus not only on QML models, both kernel-based and neural network-based, but also on recent explorations of their integration with classical machine learning layers within hybrid frameworks. Moreover, we examine both theoretical analysis and empirical findings to better understand their capabilities, and we also discuss the efforts on noise-resilient and hardware-efficient QML that could enhance its practicality under current hardware limitations. In addition, we cover several emerging paradigms for advanced quantum circuit design and highlight the adaptability of QML across representative application domains. This study aims to provide an overview of the contributions made to bridge quantum computing and machine learning, offering insights and guidance to support its future development and pave the way for broader adoption in the coming years.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring the Interpretability of Forecasting Models for Energy Balancing Market</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00049</link><description>arXiv:2602.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balancing market in the energy sector plays a critical role in physically and financially balancing the supply and demand. Modeling dynamics in the balancing market can provide valuable insights and prognosis for power grid stability and secure energy supply. While complex machine learning models can achieve high accuracy, their black-box nature severely limits the model interpretability. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability for the energy balancing market. Particularly, we take the example of forecasting manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) activation price in the balancing market using real market data from different energy price zones. We explore the interpretability of mFRR forecasting using two models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine and explainable boosting machine (EBM). We also integrate the two models, and we benchmark all the models against a baseline naive model. Our results show that EBM provides forecasting accuracy comparable to XGBoost while yielding a considerable level of interpretability. Our analysis also underscores the challenge of accurately predicting the mFRR price for the instances when the activation price deviates significantly from the spot price. Importantly, EBM's interpretability features reveal insights into non-linear mFRR price drivers and regional market dynamics. Our study demonstrates that EBM is a viable and valuable interpretable alternative to complex black-box AI models in the forecast for the balancing market.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explore Brain-Inspired Machine Intelligence for Connecting Dots on Graphs Through Holographic Blueprint of Oscillatory Synchronization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00057</link><description>arXiv:2602.00057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural coupling in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence emerges as dynamic oscillatory patterns that encode abstract concepts. To this end, we hypothesize that a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms governing brain rhythms can inspire next-generation design principles for machine learning algorithms, leading to improved efficiency and robustness. Building on this idea, we first model evolving brain rhythms through the interference of spontaneously synchronized neural oscillations, termed HoloBrain. The success of modeling brain rhythms using an artificial dynamical system of coupled oscillations motivates a "first principle" for brain-inspired machine intelligence based on a shared synchronization mechanism, termed HoloGraph. This principle enables graph neural networks to move beyond conventional heat diffusion paradigms toward modeling oscillatory synchronization. Our HoloGraph framework not only effectively mitigates the over-smoothing problem in graph neural networks but also demonstrates strong potential for reasoning and solving challenging problems on graphs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00057v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On finite-dimensional encoding/decoding theorems for neural operators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00068</link><description>arXiv:2602.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, versions of neural networks with infinite-dimensional affine operators inside the computational units (``neural operator'' networks) have been applied to learn solutions to differential equations. To enable practical computations, one employs finite-dimensional encoding/decoding theorems of the following kind: every continuous mapping $f$ between function spaces $E$ and $F$ is approximated in the topology of uniform convergence on compacta by continuous mappings factoring through two finite dimensional Banach spaces. Such a result is known (Kovachki et al., 2023) for $E,F$ being Banach spaces having the approximation property. We point out that the result needs no assumptions on $E,F$ whatsoever and remains true not only for all normed spaces, but for arbitrary locally convex spaces as well. At the same time, an analogous result for $C^k$-smooth mappings and the $C^k$ compact open topology, $k\geq 1$, holds if and only if the space $E$ has the approximation property. This analysis may be useful already because non-normable locally convex function spaces are common in the theory of differential equations, the main field of applications for the emerging theory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The GT-Score: A Robust Objective Function for Reducing Overfitting in Data-Driven Trading Strategies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00080</link><description>arXiv:2602.00080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overfitting remains a critical challenge in data-driven financial modeling, where machine learning (ML) systems learn spurious patterns in historical prices and fail out of sample and in deployment. This paper introduces the GT-Score, a composite objective function that integrates performance, statistical significance, consistency, and downside risk to guide optimization toward more robust trading strategies. This approach directly addresses critical pitfalls in quantitative strategy development, specifically data snooping during optimization and the unreliability of statistical inference under non-normal return distributions. Using historical stock data for 50 S&amp;amp;P 500 companies spanning 2010-2024, we conduct an empirical evaluation that includes walk-forward validation with nine sequential time splits and a Monte Carlo study with 15 random seeds across three trading strategies. In walk-forward validation, GT-Score improves the generalization ratio (validation return divided by training return) by 98% relative to baseline objective functions. Paired statistical tests on Monte Carlo out-of-sample returns indicate statistically detectable differences between objective functions (p &lt; 0.01 for comparisons with Sortino and Simple), with small effect sizes. These results suggest that embedding an anti-overfitting structure into the objective can improve the reliability of backtests in quantitative research.

Abstract: This study addresses the low-volatility Chinese Public Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) market, proposing a large language model (LLM)-driven trading framework based on multi-agent collaboration. The system constructs four types of analytical agents-announcement, event, price momentum, and market-each conducting analysis from different dimensions; then the prediction agent integrates these multi-source signals to output directional probability distributions across multiple time horizons, then the decision agent generates discrete position adjustment signals based on the prediction results and risk control constraints, thereby forming a closed loop of analysis-prediction-decision-execution. This study further compares two prediction model pathways: for the prediction agent, directly calling the general-purpose large model DeepSeek-R1 versus using a specialized small model Qwen3-8B fine-tuned via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alignment. In the backtest from October 2024 to October 2025, both agent-based strategies significantly outperformed the buy-and-hold benchmark in terms of cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The results indicate that the multi-agent framework can effectively enhance the risk-adjusted return of REITs trading, and the fine-tuned small model performs close to or even better than the general-purpose large model in some scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00082v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Impact of LLMs news Sentiment Analysis on Stock Price Movement Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00086</link><description>arXiv:2602.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses stock price movement prediction by leveraging LLM-based news sentiment analysis. Earlier works have largely focused on proposing and assessing sentiment analysis models and stock movement prediction methods, however, separately. Although promising results have been achieved, a clear and in-depth understanding of the benefit of the news sentiment to this task, as well as a comprehensive assessment of different architecture types in this context, is still lacking. Herein, we conduct an evaluation study that compares 3 different LLMs, namely, DeBERTa, RoBERTa and FinBERT, for sentiment-driven stock prediction. Our results suggest that DeBERTa outperforms the other two models with an accuracy of 75% and that an ensemble model that combines the three models can increase the accuracy to about 80%. Also, we see that sentiment news features can benefit (slightly) some stock market prediction models, i.e., LSTM-, PatchTST- and tPatchGNN-based classifiers and PatchTST- and TimesNet-based regression tasks models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Frequent Pattern Mining approach to Image Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00100</link><description>arXiv:2602.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on Image Compression, explaining efficient approaches based on Frequent Pattern Mining(FPM). The proposed compression mechanism is based on clustering similar pixels in the image and thus using cluster identifiers in image compression. Redundant data in the image is effectively handled by replacing the DCT phase of conventional JPEG through a mixture of k-means Clustering and Closed Frequent Sequence Mining. To optimize the cardinality of pattern(s) in encoding, efficient pruning techniques have been used through the refinement of Conventional Generalized Sequential Pattern Mining(GSP) algorithm. We have proposed a mechanism for finding the frequency of a sequence which will yield significant reduction in the code table size. The algorithm is tested by compressing benchmark datasets yielding an improvement of 45% in compression ratios, often outperforming the existing alternatives. PSNR and SSIM, which are the image quality metrics, have been tested which show a negligible loss in visual quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00100v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Formal Approach to AMM Fee Mechanisms with Lean 4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00101</link><description>arXiv:2602.00101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized financial markets by enabling complex asset-exchange protocols without trusted intermediaries. Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a central component of DeFi, providing the core functionality of swapping assets of different types at algorithmically computed exchange rates. Several mainstream AMM implementations are based on the constant-product model, which ensures that swaps preserve the product of the token reserves in the AMM -- up to a \emph{trading fee} used to incentivize liquidity provision. Trading fees substantially complicate the economic properties of AMMs, and for this reason some AMM models abstract them away in order to simplify the analysis. However, trading fees have a non-trivial impact on users' trading strategies, making it crucial to develop refined AMM models that precisely account for their effects. We extend a foundational model of AMMs by introducing a new parameter, the trading fee $\phi\in(0,1]$, into the swap rate function. Fee amounts increase inversely proportional to $\phi$. When $\phi = 1$, no fee is applied and the original model is recovered. We analyze the resulting fee-adjusted model from an economic perspective. We show that several key properties of the swap rate function, including output-boundedness and monotonicity, are preserved. At the same time, other properties - most notably additivity - no longer hold. We precisely characterize this deviation by deriving a generalized form of additivity that captures the effect of swaps in the presence of trading fees. We prove that when $\phi &lt; 1$, executing a single large swap yields strictly greater profit than splitting the trade into smaller ones. Finally, we derive a closed-form solution to the arbitrage problem in the presence of trading fees and prove its uniqueness. All results are formalized and machine-checked in the Lean 4 proof assistant.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00101v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Radiomics in Medical Imaging: Methods, Applications, and Challenges</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00102</link><description>arXiv:2602.00102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiomics enables quantitative medical image analysis by converting imaging data into structured, high-dimensional feature representations for predictive modeling. Despite methodological developments and encouraging retrospective results, radiomics continue to face persistent challenges related to feature instability, limited reproducibility, validation bias, and restricted clinical translation. Existing reviews largely focus on application-specific outcomes or isolated pipeline components, with limited analysis of how interdependent design choices across acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation collectively affect robustness and generalizability. This survey provides an end-to-end analysis of radiomics pipelines, examining how methodological decisions at each stage influence feature stability, model reliability, and translational validity. This paper reviews radiomic feature extraction, selection, and dimensionality reduction strategies; classical machine and deep learning-based modeling approaches; and ensemble and hybrid frameworks, with emphasis on validation protocols, data leakage prevention, and statistical reliability. Clinical applications are discussed with a focus on evaluation rigor rather than reported performance metrics. The survey identifies open challenges in standardization, domain shift, and clinical deployment, and outlines future directions such as hybrid radiomics-artificial intelligence models, multimodal fusion, federated learning, and standardized benchmarking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00102v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autonomous Multi-Agent AI for High-Throughput Polymer Informatics: From Property Prediction to Generative Design Across Synthetic and Bio-Polymers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00103</link><description>arXiv:2602.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an integrated multiagent AI ecosystem for polymer discovery that unifies high-throughput materials workflows, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling within a single Polymer Research Lifecycle (PRL) pipeline. The system orchestrates specialized agents powered by state-of-the-art large language models (DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-Coder) to retrieve and reason over scientific resources, invoke external tools, execute domain-specific code, and perform metacognitive self-assessment for robust end-to-end task execution. We demonstrate three practical capabilities: a high-fidelity polymer property prediction and generative design pipeline, a fully automated multimodal workflow for biopolymer structure characterization, and a metacognitive agent framework that can monitor performance and improve execution strategies over time. On a held-out test set of 1,251 polymers, our PolyGNN agent achieves strong predictive accuracy, reaching R2 = 0.89 for glass-transition temperature (Tg ), R2 = 0.82 for tensile strength, R2 = 0.75 for elongation, and R2 = 0.91 for density. The framework also provides uncertainty estimates via multiagent consensus and scales with linear complexity to at least 10,000 polymers, enabling high-throughput screening at low computational cost. For a representative workload, the system completes inference in 16.3 s using about 2 GB of memory and 0.1 GPU hours, at an estimated cost of about $0.08. On a dedicated Tg benchmark, our approach attains R2 = 0.78, outperforming strong baselines including single-LLM prediction (R2 = 0.67), group-contribution methods (R2 = 0.71), and ChemCrow (R2 = 0.66). We further demonstrate metacognitive control in a polystyrene case study, where the system not only produces domain-level scientific outputs but continually monitors and optimizes its own behavior through tactical, strategic, and meta-strategic self-assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PredictionMarketBench: A SWE-bench-Style Framework for Backtesting Trading Agents on Prediction Markets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00133</link><description>arXiv:2602.00133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction markets offer a natural testbed for trading agents: contracts have binary payoffs, prices can be interpreted as probabilities, and realized performance depends critically on market microstructure, fees, and settlement risk. We introduce PredictionMarketBench, a SWE-bench-style benchmark for evaluating algorithmic and LLM-based trading agents on prediction markets via deterministic, event-driven replay of historical limit-order-book and trade data. PredictionMarketBench standardizes (i) episode construction from raw exchange streams (orderbooks, trades, lifecycle, settlement), (ii) an execution-realistic simulator with maker/taker semantics and fee modeling, and (iii) a tool-based agent interface that supports both classical strategies and tool-calling LLM agents with reproducible trajectories. We release four Kalshi-based episodes spanning cryptocurrency, weather, and sports. Baseline results show that naive trading agents can underperform due to transaction costs and settlement losses, while fee-aware algorithmic strategies remain competitive in volatile episodes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward a Unified Semantic Loss Model for Deep JSCC-based Transmission of EO Imagery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00136</link><description>arXiv:2602.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Earth Observation (EO) systems increasingly rely on high-resolution imagery to support critical applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and land-use analysis. Although these applications benefit from detailed visual data, the resulting data volumes impose significant challenges on satellite communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth, power, and dynamic link conditions. To address these limitations, this paper investigates Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) as an effective source-channel paradigm for the transmission of EO imagery. We focus on two complementary aspects of semantic loss in DJSCC-based systems. First, a reconstruction-centric framework is evaluated by analyzing the semantic degradation of reconstructed images under varying compression ratios and channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Second, a task-oriented framework is developed by integrating DJSCC with lightweight, application-specific models (e.g., EfficientViT), with performance measured using downstream task accuracy rather than pixel-level fidelity. Based on extensive empirical analysis, we propose a unified semantic loss framework that captures both reconstruction-centric and task-oriented performance within a single model. This framework characterizes the implicit relationship between JSCC compression, channel SNR, and semantic quality, offering actionable insights for the design of robust and efficient EO imagery transmission under resource-constrained satellite links.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00136v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Comparison of Image Processing Models in Quark Gluon Jet Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00141</link><description>arXiv:2602.00141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparison of convolutional and transformer-based models for distinguishing quark and gluon jets using simulated jet images from Pythia 8. By encoding jet substructure into a three-channel representation of particle kinematics, we evaluate the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Swin Transformers (Swin-Tiny) under both supervised and self-supervised learning setups. Our results show that fine-tuning only the final two transformer blocks of the Swin-Tiny model achieves the best trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, reaching 81.4% accuracy and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 88.9%. Self-supervised pretraining with Momentum Contrast (MoCo) further enhances feature robustness and reduces the number of trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of hierarchical attention-based models for jet substructure studies and for domain transfer to real collision data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00141v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Early warning prediction: Onsager-Machlup vs Schr\"{o}dinger</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00143</link><description>arXiv:2602.00143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting critical transitions in complex systems, such as epileptic seizures in the brain, represents a major challenge in scientific research. The high-dimensional characteristics and hidden critical signals further complicate early-warning tasks. This study proposes a novel early-warning framework that integrates manifold learning with stochastic dynamical system modeling. Through systematic comparison, six methods including diffusion maps (DM) are selected to construct low-dimensional representations. Based on these, a data-driven stochastic differential equation model is established to robustly estimate the probability evolution scoring function of the system. Building on this, a new Score Function (SF) indicator is defined by incorporating Schr\"{o}dinger bridge theory to quantify the likelihood of significant state transitions in the system. Experiments demonstrate that this indicator exhibits higher sensitivity and robustness in epilepsy prediction, enables earlier identification of critical points, and clearly captures dynamic features across various stages before and after seizure onset. This work provides a systematic theoretical framework and practical methodology for extracting early-warning signals from high-dimensional data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00143v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProDCARL: Reinforcement Learning-Aligned Diffusion Models for De Novo Antimicrobial Peptide Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00157</link><description>arXiv:2602.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance threatens healthcare sustainability and motivates low-cost computational discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). De novo peptide generation must optimize antimicrobial activity and safety through low predicted toxicity, but likelihood-trained generators do not enforce these goals explicitly. We introduce ProDCARL, a reinforcement-learning alignment framework that couples a diffusion-based protein generator (EvoDiff OA-DM 38M) with sequence property predictors for AMP activity and peptide toxicity. We fine-tune the diffusion prior on AMP sequences to obtain a domain-aware generator. Top-k policy-gradient updates use classifier-derived rewards plus entropy regularization and early stopping to preserve diversity and reduce reward hacking. In silico experiments show ProDCARL increases the mean predicted AMP score from 0.081 after fine-tuning to 0.178. The joint high-quality hit rate reaches 6.3\% with pAMP $&gt;$0.7 and pTox $&lt;$0.3. ProDCARL maintains high diversity, with $1-$mean pairwise identity equal to 0.929. Qualitative analyses with AlphaFold3 and ProtBERT embeddings suggest candidates show plausible AMP-like structural and semantic characteristics. ProDCARL serves as a candidate generator that narrows experimental search space, and experimental validation remains future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00157v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00169</link><description>arXiv:2602.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.
  To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty-Aware Multimodal Learning via Conformal Shapley Intervals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00171</link><description>arXiv:2602.00171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning combines information from multiple data modalities to improve predictive performance. However, modalities often contribute unequally and in a data dependent way, making it unclear which data modalities are genuinely informative and to what extent their contributions can be trusted. Quantifying modality level importance together with uncertainty is therefore central to interpretable and reliable multimodal learning. We introduce conformal Shapley intervals, a framework that combines Shapley values with conformal inference to construct uncertainty-aware importance intervals for each modality. Building on these intervals, we propose a modality selection procedure with a provable optimality guarantee: conditional on the observed features, the selected subset of modalities achieves performance close to that of the optimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple datasets, showing that it provides meaningful uncertainty quantification and strong predictive performance while relying on only a small number of informative modalities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00171v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neuron Block Dynamics for XOR Classification with Zero-Margin</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00172</link><description>arXiv:2602.00172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of neural networks to learn useful features through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a cornerstone of their success. Most theoretical analyses focus on regression or on classification tasks with a positive margin, where worst-case gradient bounds suffice. In contrast, we study zero-margin nonlinear classification by analyzing the Gaussian XOR problem, where inputs are Gaussian and the XOR decision boundary determines labels. In this setting, a non-negligible fraction of data lies arbitrarily close to the boundary, breaking standard margin-based arguments. Building on Glasgow's (2024) analysis, we extend the study of training dynamics from discrete to Gaussian inputs and develop a framework for the dynamics of neuron blocks. We show that neurons cluster into four directions and that block-level signals evolve coherently, a phenomenon essential in the Gaussian setting where individual neuron signals vary significantly. Leveraging this block perspective, we analyze generalization without relying on margin assumptions, adopting an average-case view that distinguishes regions of reliable prediction from regions of persistent error. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted two-phase block dynamics and demonstrate their robustness beyond the Gaussian setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Visible Singularities Guided Correlation Network for Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00184</link><description>arXiv:2602.00184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers the advantages of reduced radiation dose and shortened scanning time. Traditional reconstruction algorithms exhibit various inherent limitations in LACT. Currently, most deep learning-based LACT reconstruction methods focus on multi-domain fusion or the introduction of generic priors, failing to fully align with the core imaging characteristics of LACT-such as the directionality of artifacts and directional loss of structural information, which are caused by the absence of projection angles in certain directions. Inspired by the theory of visible and invisible singularities, taking into account the aforementioned core imaging characteristics of LACT, we propose a Visible Singularities Guided Correlation network for LACT reconstruction (VSGC). The design philosophy of VSGC consists of two core steps: First, extract VS edge features from LACT images and focus the model's attention on these VS. Second, establish correlations between the VS edge features and other regions of the image. Additionally, a multi-scale loss function with anisotropic constraint is employed to constrain the model to converge in multiple aspects. Finally, qualitative and quantitative validations are conducted on both simulated and real datasets to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design. Particularly, in comparison with alternative methods, VSGC delivers more prominent performance in small angular ranges, with the PSNR improvement of 2.45 dB and the SSIM enhancement of 1.5\%.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into materials science offers a transformative opportunity to streamline computational workflows, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by rigid tool-calling approaches and narrowly scoped agents. In this work, we introduce QUASAR, a universal autonomous system for atomistic simulation designed to facilitate production-grade scientific discovery. QUASAR autonomously orchestrates complex multi-scale workflows across diverse methods, including density functional theory, machine learning potentials, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. The system incorporates robust mechanisms for adaptive planning, context-efficient memory management, and hybrid knowledge retrieval to navigate real-world research scenarios without human intervention. We benchmark QUASAR against a series of three-tiered tasks, progressing from routine tasks to frontier research challenges such as photocatalyst screening and novel material assessment. These results suggest that QUASAR can function as a general atomistic reasoning system rather than a task-specific automation framework. They also provide initial evidence supporting the potential deployment of agentic AI as a component of computational chemistry research workflows, while identifying areas requiring further development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SurfelSoup: Learned Point Cloud Geometry Compression With a Probablistic SurfelTree Representation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00186</link><description>arXiv:2602.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SurfelSoup, an end-to-end learned surface-based framework for point cloud geometry compression, with surface-structured primitives for representation. It proposes a probabilistic surface representation, pSurfel, which models local point occupancies using a bounded generalized Gaussian distribution. In addition, the pSurfels are organized into an octree-like hierarchy, pSurfelTree, with a Tree Decision module that adaptively terminates the tree subdivision for rate-distortion optimal Surfel granularity selection. This formulation avoids redundant point-wise compression in smooth regions and produces compact yet smooth surface reconstructions. Experimental results under the MPEG common test condition show consistent gain on geometry compression over voxel-based baselines and MPEG standard G-PCC-GesTM-TriSoup, while providing visually superior reconstructions with smooth and coherent surface structures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rank-and-Reason: Multi-Agent Collaboration Accelerates Zero-Shot Protein Mutation Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00197</link><description>arXiv:2602.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot mutation prediction is vital for low-resource protein engineering, yet existing protein language models (PLMs) often yield statistically confident results that ignore fundamental biophysical constraints. Currently, selecting candidates for wet-lab validation relies on manual expert auditing of PLM outputs, a process that is inefficient, subjective, and highly dependent on domain expertise. To address this, we propose Rank-and-Reason (VenusRAR), a two-stage agentic framework to automate this workflow and maximize expected wet-lab fitness. In the Rank-Stage, a Computational Expert and Virtual Biologist aggregate a context-aware multi-modal ensemble, establishing a new Spearman correlation record of 0.551 (vs. 0.518) on ProteinGym. In the Reason-Stage, an agentic Expert Panel employs chain-of-thought reasoning to audit candidates against geometric and structural constraints, improving the Top-5 Hit Rate by up to 367% on ProteinGym-DMS99. The wet-lab validation on Cas12i3 nuclease further confirms the framework's efficacy, achieving a 46.7% positive rate and identifying two novel mutants with 4.23-fold and 5.05-fold activity improvements.

Abstract: The rapid growth in video consumption has introduced significant challenges to modern streaming architectures. Over-the-Top (OTT) video delivery now predominantly relies on Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming, which dynamically adjusts bitrate and resolution based on client-side constraints such as display capabilities and network bandwidth. This pipeline typically involves downsampling the original high-resolution content, encoding and transmitting it, followed by decoding and upsampling on the client side. Traditionally, these processing stages have been optimized in isolation, leading to suboptimal end-to-end rate-distortion (R-D) performance. The advent of deep learning has spurred interest in jointly optimizing the ABR pipeline using learned resampling methods. However, training such systems end-to-end remains challenging due to the non-differentiable nature of standard video codecs, which obstructs gradient-based optimization. Recent works have addressed this issue using differentiable proxy models, based either on deep neural networks or hybrid coding schemes with differentiable components such as soft quantization, to approximate the codec behavior. While differentiable proxy codecs have enabled progress in compression-aware learning, they remain approximations that may not fully capture the behavior of standard, non-differentiable codecs. To our knowledge, there is no prior evidence demonstrating the inefficiencies of using standard codecs during training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that enables end-to-end training with real, non-differentiable codecs by leveraging data-driven surrogate gradients derived from actual compression errors. It facilitates the alignment between training objectives and deployment performance. Experimental results show a 5.19\% improvement in BD-BR (PSNR) compared to codec-agnostic training approaches, consistently across the entire rate-distortion convex hull spanning multiple downsampling ratios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Renderer-Enabled Framework for Computing Parameter Estimation Lower Bounds in Plenoptic Imaging Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00215</link><description>arXiv:2602.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on assessing the information-theoretic limits of scene parameter estimation in plenoptic imaging systems. A general framework to compute lower bounds on the parameter estimation error from noisy plenoptic observations is presented, with a particular focus on passive indirect imaging problems, where the observations do not contain line-of-sight information about the parameter(s) of interest. Using computer graphics rendering software to synthesize the often-complicated dependence among parameter(s) of interest and observations, i.e. the forward model, the proposed framework evaluates the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to establish lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator of the unknown parameters. The effects of inexact rendering of the true forward model on the computed lower bounds are also analyzed, both theoretically and via simulations. Experimental evaluations compare the computed lower bounds with the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator on a canonical object localization problem, showing that the lower bounds computed via the framework proposed here are indicative of the true underlying fundamental limits in several nominally representative scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advanced Geometric Correction Algorithms for 3D Medical Reconstruction: Comparison of Computed Tomography and Macroscopic Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00220</link><description>arXiv:2602.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid two-stage registration framework for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) kidney anatomy from macroscopic slices, using CT-derived models as the geometric reference standard. The approach addresses the data-scarcity and high-distortion challenges typical of macroscopic imaging, where fully learning-based registration (e.g., VoxelMorph) often fails to generalize due to limited training diversity and large nonrigid deformations that exceed the capture range of unconstrained convolutional filters. In the proposed pipeline, the Optimal Cross-section Matching (OCM) algorithm first performs constrained global alignment: translation, rotation, and uniform scaling to establish anatomically consistent slice initialization. Next, a lightweight deep-learning refinement network, inspired by VoxelMorph, predicts residual local deformations between consecutive slices. The core novelty of this architecture lies in its hierarchical decomposition of the registration manifold. This hybrid OCM+DL design integrates explicit geometric priors with the flexible learning capacity of neural networks, ensuring stable optimization and plausible deformation fields even with few training examples. Experiments on an original dataset of 40 kidneys demonstrated better results compared to single-stage baselines. The pipeline maintains physical calibration via Hough-based grid detection and employs Bezier-based contour smoothing for robust meshing and volume estimation. Although validated on kidney data, the proposed framework generalizes to other soft-tissue organs reconstructed from optical or photographic cross-sections. By decoupling interpretable global optimization from data-efficient deep refinement, the method advances the precision, reproducibility, and anatomical realism of multimodal 3D reconstructions for surgical planning, morphological assessment, and medical education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Vanilla GAN, DCGAN, and WGAN Architectures for MRI Reconstruction: A Quantitative Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00221</link><description>arXiv:2602.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial imaging modality for viewing internal body structures. This research work analyses the performance of popular GAN models for accurate and precise MRI reconstruction by enhancing image quality and improving diagnostic accuracy. Three GAN architectures considered in this study are Vanilla GAN, Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). They were trained and evaluated using knee, brain, and cardiac MRI datasets to assess their generalizability across body regions. While the Vanilla GAN operates on the fundamentals of the adversarial network setup, DCGAN advances image synthesis by securing the convolutional layers, giving a superior appearance to the prevalent spatial features. Training instability is resolved in WGAN through the Wasserstein distance to minimize an unstable regime, therefore, ensuring stable convergence and high-quality images. The GAN models were trained and tested using 1000 MR images of an anonymized knee, 805 images of Heart, 90 images of Brain MRI dataset. The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for Vanilla GAN is 0.84, DCGAN is 0.97, and WGAN is 0.99. The Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for Vanilla GAN is 26, DCGAN is 49.3, and WGAN is 43.5. The results were further statistically validated. This study shows that DCGAN and WGAN-based frameworks are promising in MR image reconstruction because of good image quality and superior accuracy. With the first cross-organ benchmark of baseline GANs under a common preprocessing pipeline, this work provides a reproducible benchmark for future hybrid GANs and clinical MRI applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00221v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dual Quaternion SE(3) Synchronization with Recovery Guarantees</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00324</link><description>arXiv:2602.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization over the special Euclidean group SE(3) aims to recover absolute poses from noisy pairwise relative transformations and is a core primitive in robotics and 3D vision. Standard approaches often require multi-step heuristic procedures to recover valid poses, which are difficult to analyze and typically lack theoretical guarantees. This paper adopts a dual quaternion representation and formulates SE(3) synchronization directly over the unit dual quaternion. A two-stage algorithm is developed: A spectral initializer computed via the power method on a Hermitian dual quaternion measurement matrix, followed by a dual quaternion generalized power method (DQGPM) that enforces feasibility through per-iteration projection. The estimation error bounds are established for spectral estimators, and DQGPM is shown to admit a finite-iteration error bound and achieves linear error contraction up to an explicit noise-dependent threshold. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world multi-scan point-set registration demonstrate that the proposed pipeline improves both accuracy and efficiency over representative matrix-based methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parametrization of subgrid scales in long-term simulations of the shallow-water equations using machine learning and convex limiting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00378</link><description>arXiv:2602.00378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for parametrizing sub-grid processes in the Shallow Water equations. We define coarse variables and local spatial averages and use a feed-forward neural network to learn sub-grid fluxes. Our method results in a local parametrization that uses a four-point computational stencil, which has several advantages over globally coupled parametrizations. We demonstrate numerically that our method improves energy balance in long-term turbulent simulations and also accurately reproduces individual solutions. The neural network parametrization can be easily combined with flux limiting to reduce oscillations near shocks. More importantly, our method provides reliable parametrizations, even in dynamical regimes that are not included in the training data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00378v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Singular Bayesian Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00387</link><description>arXiv:2602.00387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian neural networks promise calibrated uncertainty but require $O(mn)$ parameters for standard mean-field Gaussian posteriors. We argue this cost is often unnecessary, particularly when weight matrices exhibit fast singular value decay. By parameterizing weights as $W = AB^{\top}$ with $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times r}$, we induce a posterior that is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, concentrating on the rank-$r$ manifold. This singularity captures structured weight correlations through shared latent factors, geometrically distinct from mean-field's independence assumption. We derive PAC-Bayes generalization bounds whose complexity term scales as $\sqrt{r(m+n)}$ instead of $\sqrt{m n}$, and prove loss bounds that decompose the error into optimization and rank-induced bias using the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem. We further adapt recent Gaussian complexity bounds for low-rank deterministic networks to Bayesian predictive means. Empirically, across MLPs, LSTMs, and Transformers on standard benchmarks, our method achieves predictive performance competitive with 5-member Deep Ensembles while using up to $15\times$ fewer parameters. Furthermore, it substantially improves OOD detection and often improves calibration relative to mean-field and perturbation baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00387v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning for Control Systems with Time Delays: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00399</link><description>arXiv:2602.00399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in the control and decision-making of complex dynamical systems. However, most RL algorithms rely on the Markov Decision Process assumption, which is violated in practical cyber-physical systems affected by sensing delays, actuation latencies, and communication constraints. Such time delays introduce memory effects that can significantly degrade performance and compromise stability, particularly in networked and multi-agent environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL methods designed to address time delays in control systems. We first formalize the main classes of delays and analyze their impact on the Markov property. We then systematically categorize existing approaches into five major families: state augmentation and history-based representations, recurrent policies with learned memory, predictor-based and model-aware methods, robust and domain-randomized training strategies, and safe RL frameworks with explicit constraint handling. For each family, we discuss underlying principles, practical advantages, and inherent limitations. A comparative analysis highlights key trade-offs among these approaches and provides practical guidelines for selecting suitable methods under different delay characteristics and safety requirements. Finally, we identify open challenges and promising research directions, including stability certification, large-delay learning, multi-agent communication co-design, and standardized benchmarking. This survey aims to serve as a unified reference for researchers and practitioners developing reliable RL-based controllers in delay-affected cyber-physical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00399v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Alignment of Diffusion Model and Flow Matching for Text-to-Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00413</link><description>arXiv:2602.00413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models and flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success in text-to-image generation. While many existing alignment methods primarily focus on fine-tuning pre-trained generative models to maximize a given reward function, these approaches require extensive computational resources and may not generalize well across different objectives. In this work, we propose a novel alignment framework by leveraging the underlying nature of the alignment problem -- sampling from reward-weighted distributions -- and show that it applies to both diffusion models (via score guidance) and flow matching models (via velocity guidance). The score function (velocity field) required for the reward-weighted distribution can be decomposed into the pre-trained score (velocity field) plus a conditional expectation of the reward. For the alignment on the diffusion model, we identify a fundamental challenge: the adversarial nature of the guidance term can introduce undesirable artifacts in the generated images. Therefore, we propose a finetuning-free framework that trains a guidance network to estimate the conditional expectation of the reward. We achieve comparable performance to finetuning-based models with one-step generation with at least a 60% reduction in computational cost. For the alignment on flow matching, we propose a training-free framework that improves the generation quality without additional computational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00413v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Shuffle and Joint Differential Privacy for Generalized Linear Contextual Bandits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00417</link><description>arXiv:2602.00417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first algorithms for generalized linear contextual bandits under shuffle differential privacy and joint differential privacy. While prior work on private contextual bandits has been restricted to linear reward models -- which admit closed-form estimators -- generalized linear models (GLMs) pose fundamental new challenges: no closed-form estimator exists, requiring private convex optimization; privacy must be tracked across multiple evolving design matrices; and optimization error must be explicitly incorporated into regret analysis.
  We address these challenges under two privacy models and context settings. For stochastic contexts, we design a shuffle-DP algorithm achieving $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ regret. For adversarial contexts, we provide a joint-DP algorithm with $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ regret -- matching the non-private rate up to a $1/\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ factor. Both algorithms remove dependence on the instance-specific parameter $\kappa$ (which can be exponential in dimension) from the dominant $\sqrt{T}$ term. Unlike prior work on locally private GLM bandits, our methods require no spectral assumptions on the context distribution beyond $\ell_2$ boundedness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00417v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Topological Residual Asymmetry for Bivariate Causal Direction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00427</link><description>arXiv:2602.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring causal direction from purely observational bivariate data is fragile: many methods commit to a direction even in ambiguous or near non-identifiable regimes. We propose Topological Residual Asymmetry (TRA), a geometry-based criterion for additive-noise models. TRA compares the shapes of two cross-fitted regressor-residual clouds after rank-based copula standardization: in the correct direction, residuals are approximately independent, producing a two-dimensional bulk, while in the reverse direction -- especially under low noise -- the cloud concentrates near a one-dimensional tube. We quantify this bulk-tube contrast using a 0D persistent-homology functional, computed efficiently from Euclidean MST edge-length profiles. We prove consistency in a triangular-array small-noise regime, extend the method to fixed noise via a binned variant (TRA-s), and introduce TRA-C, a confounding-aware abstention rule calibrated by a Gaussian-copula plug-in bootstrap. Extensive experiments across many challenging synthetic and real-data scenarios demonstrate the method's superiority.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A 30-item Test for Assessing Chinese Character Amnesia in Child Handwriters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00464</link><description>arXiv:2602.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handwriting literacy is an important skill for learning and communication in school-age children. In the digital age, handwriting has been largely replaced by typing, leading to a decline in handwriting proficiency, particularly in non-alphabetic writing systems. Among children learning Chinese, a growing number have reported experiencing character amnesia: difficulty in correctly handwriting a character despite being able to recognize it. Given that there is currently no standardized diagnostic tool for assessing character amnesia in children, we developed an assessment to measure Chinese character amnesia in Mandarin-speaking school-age population. We utilised a large-scale handwriting dataset in which 40 children handwrote 800 characters from dictation prompts. Character amnesia and correct handwriting responses were analysed using a two-parameter Item Response Theory model. Four item-selection schemes were compared: random baseline, maximum discrimination, diverse difficulty, and an upper-and-lower-thirds discrimination score. Candidate item subsets were evaluated using out-of-sample prediction. Among these selection schemes, the upper-and-lower-thirds discrimination procedure yields a compact 30-item test that preserves individual-difference structure and generalizes to unseen test-takers (cross-validated mean r =.74 with full 800-item-test; within-sample r =.93). This short-form test provides a reliable and efficient tool of assessing Chinese character amnesia in children and can be used to identify early handwriting and orthographic learning difficulties, contributing to the early detection of developmental dysgraphia and related literacy challenges.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00464v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Phase Recognition via Quantum Attention Mechanism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00473</link><description>arXiv:2602.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions in many-body systems are fundamentally characterized by complex correlation structures, which pose computational challenges for conventional methods in large systems. To address this, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical attention model. This model uses an attention mechanism, realized through swap tests and a parameterized quantum circuit, to extract correlations within quantum states and perform ground-state classification. Benchmarked on the cluster-Ising model with system sizes of 9 and 15 qubits, the model achieves high classification accuracy with less than 100 training data and demonstrates robustness against variations in the training set. Further analysis reveals that the model successfully captures phase-sensitive features and characteristic physical length scales, offering a scalable and data-efficient approach for quantum phase recognition in complex many-body systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00473v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stabilizing Fixed-Point Iteration for Markov Chain Poisson Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00474</link><description>arXiv:2602.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poisson equations underpin average-reward reinforcement learning, but beyond ergodicity they can be ill-posed, meaning that solutions are non-unique and standard fixed point iterations can oscillate on reducible or periodic chains. We study finite-state Markov chains with $n$ states and transition matrix $P$. We show that all non-decaying modes are captured by a real peripheral invariant subspace $\mathcal{K}(P)$, and that the induced operator on the quotient space $\mathbb{R}^n/\mathcal{K}(P)$ is strictly contractive, yielding a unique quotient solution. Building on this viewpoint, we develop an end-to-end pipeline that learns the chain structure, estimates an anchor based gauge map, and runs projected stochastic approximation to estimate a gauge-fixed representative together with an associated peripheral residual. We prove $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1/2})$ convergence up to projection estimation error, enabling stable Poisson equation learning for multichain and periodic regimes with applications to performance evaluation of average-reward reinforcement learning beyond ergodicity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00474v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recent Advances of End-to-End Video Coding Technologies for AVS Standard Development</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00483</link><description>arXiv:2602.00483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video coding standards are essential to enable the interoperability and widespread adoption of efficient video compression technologies. In pursuit of greater video compression efficiency, the AVS video coding working group launched the standardization exploration of end-to-end intelligent video coding, establishing the AVS End-to-End Intelligent Video Coding Exploration Model (AVS-EEM) project. A core design principle of AVS-EEM is its focus on practical deployment, featuring inherently low computational complexity and requiring strict adherence to the common test conditions of conventional video coding. This paper details the development history of AVS-EEM and provides a systematic introduction to its key technical framework, covering model architectures, training strategies, and inference optimizations. These innovations have collectively driven the project's rapid performance evolution, enabling continuous and significant gains under strict complexity constraints. Through over two years of iterative refinement and collaborative effort, the coding performance of AVS-EEM has seen substantial improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that its latest model achieves superior compression efficiency compared to the conventional AVS3 reference software, marking a significant step toward a deployable intelligent video coding standard.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00483v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Harnessing the Peripheral Surface Information Entropy from Globular Protein-Peptide Complexes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00498</link><description>arXiv:2602.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting favorable protein-peptide binding events remains a central challenge in biophysics, with continued uncertainty surrounding how nonlocal effects shape the global energy landscape. Here, we introduce peripheral surface information (PSI) entropy, a quantitative measure of the statistical variability in apolar and charged non-interacting surface (NIS) proportions across conformational ensembles. Using energy-directed molecular docking via HADDOCK3 and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that favorable binding partners exhibit emergent, low-entropy N-states (discrete macrostates in NIS state space) indicative of preferential apolar/charged surface configurations. Across dozens of peptides and multiple receptor systems (WW, PDZ, and MDM2 domains), dominant N-states persisted under varied docking parameters and initial conditions. An experimental meta-ensemble of WW domains from 36 high-resolution structures confirmed the presence of dominant NIS modes independent of in silico methodology, suggesting an evolutionary selection pressure toward specific NIS fingerprints. These findings establish PSI entropy as a thermoinformatic descriptor that encodes favorable binding constraints into unique statistical signatures of the NIS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00498v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entanglement-Dependent Error Bounds for Hamiltonian Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00555</link><description>arXiv:2602.00555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish tight connections between entanglement entropy and the approximation error in Trotter-Suzuki product formulas for Hamiltonian simulation. Product formulas remain the workhorse of quantum simulation on near-term devices, yet standard error analyses yield worst-case bounds that can vastly overestimate the resources required for structured problems. For systems governed by geometrically local Hamiltonians with maximum entanglement entropy $S_\text{max}$ across all bipartitions, we prove that the first-order Trotter error scales as $\mathcal{O}(t^2 S_\text{max} \operatorname{polylog}(n)/r)$ rather than the worst-case $\mathcal{O}(t^2 n/r)$, where $n$ is the system size and $r$ is the number of Trotter steps. This yields improvements of $\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ for one-dimensional area-law systems and $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{3/2})$ for two-dimensional systems. We extend these bounds to higher-order Suzuki formulas, where the improvement factor involves $2^{pS^*/2}$ for the $p$-th order formula. We further establish a separation result demonstrating that volume-law entangled systems fundamentally require $\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ more Trotter steps than area-law systems to achieve the same precision. This separation is tight up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis combines Lieb-Robinson bounds for locality, tensor network representations for entanglement structure, and novel commutator-entropy inequalities that bound the expectation value of nested commutators by the Schmidt rank of the state. These results have immediate applications to quantum chemistry, condensed matter simulation, and resource estimation for fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00555v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAG-GNN: Integrating Retrieved Knowledge with Graph Neural Networks for Precision Medicine</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00586</link><description>arXiv:2602.00586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network topology excels at structural predictions but fails to capture functional semantics encoded in biomedical literature. We present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) embedding framework that integrates graph neural network representations with dynamically retrieved literature-derived knowledge through contrastive learning. Benchmarking against ten embedding methods reveals task-specific complementarity: topology-focused methods achieve near-perfect link prediction (GCN: 0.983 AUROC), while RAG-GNN is the only method achieving positive silhouette scores for functional clustering (0.001 vs. negative scores for all baselines). Information-theoretic decomposition shows network topology contributes 77.3% of predictive information, while retrieved documents provide 8.6% unique information. Applied to cancer signaling networks (379 proteins, 3,498 interactions), the framework identifies DDR1 as a therapeutic target based on retrieved evidence of synthetic lethality with KRAS mutations. These results establish that topology-only and retrieval-augmented approaches serve complementary purposes: structural prediction tasks are solved by network topology alone, while functional interpretation uniquely benefits from retrieved knowledge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00586v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Machine Learning for Integrating Heterogeneous Analytical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00590</link><description>arXiv:2602.00590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in complex materials requires integrating complementary measurements across multiple length scales. Here we propose an interpretable "multimodal" machine learning framework that unifies heterogeneous analytical systems for end-to-end characterization, demonstrated on carbon nanotube (CNT) films whose properties are highly sensitive to microstructural variations. Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size. The proposed multimodal machine learning framework offers a general strategy for data-driven, explainable characterization of complex materials.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00590v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Action-Free Offline-to-Online RL via Discretised State Policies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00629</link><description>arXiv:2602.00629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing offline RL methods presume the availability of action labels within the dataset, but in many practical scenarios, actions may be missing due to privacy, storage, or sensor limitations. We formalise the setting of action-free offline-to-online RL, where agents must learn from datasets consisting solely of $(s,r,s')$ tuples and later leverage this knowledge during online interaction. To address this challenge, we propose learning state policies that recommend desirable next-state transitions rather than actions. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a simple yet novel state discretisation transformation and propose Offline State-Only DecQN (\algo), a value-based algorithm designed to pre-train state policies from action-free data. \algo{} integrates the transformation to scale efficiently to high-dimensional problems while avoiding instability and overfitting associated with continuous state prediction. Second, we propose a novel mechanism for guided online learning that leverages these pre-trained state policies to accelerate the learning of online agents. Together, these components establish a scalable and practical framework for leveraging action-free datasets to accelerate online RL. Empirical results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach improves convergence speed and asymptotic performance, while analyses reveal that discretisation and regularisation are critical to its effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00629v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deterministic Zeroth-Order Mirror Descent via Vector Fields with A Posteriori Certification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00634</link><description>arXiv:2602.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a deterministic zeroth-order mirror descent framework by replacing gradients with a general vector field, yielding a vector-field-driven mirror update that preserves Bregman geometry while accommodating derivative-free oracles. Our analysis provides a unified evaluation template for last-iterate function values under a relative-smoothness-type inequality, with an emphasis on trajectory-wise (a posteriori) certification: whenever a verifiable inequality holds along the realized iterates, we obtain explicit last-iterate guarantees. The framework subsumes a broad class of information-geometric algorithms, including generalized Blahut-Arimoto-type updates, by expressing their dynamics through suitable choices of the vector field. We then instantiate the theory with deterministic central finite differences in moderate dimension, where constructing the vector field via deterministic central finite differences requires 2d off-center function values (and one reusable center value), i.e., 2d+1 evaluations in total, where d is the number of input real numbers. In this deterministic finite-difference setting, the key interface property is not classical convexity alone but a punctured-neighborhood generalized star-convexity condition that isolates an explicit resolution-dependent error floor. Establishing this property for the finite-difference vector field reduces to a robust conic dominance design problem; we give an explicit scaling rule ensuring the required uniform dominance on a circular cone. Together, these results expose a hidden geometric structure linking Bregman telescoping identities, deterministic certification, and robust conic geometry in zeroth-order mirror descent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00634v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sampling from multi-modal distributions on Riemannian manifolds with training-free stochastic interpolants</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00641</link><description>arXiv:2602.00641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general methodology for sampling from un-normalized densities defined on Riemannian manifolds, with a particular focus on multi-modal targets that remain challenging for existing sampling methods. Inspired by the framework of diffusion models developed for generative modeling, we introduce a sampling algorithm based on the simulation of a non-equilibrium deterministic dynamics that transports an easy-to-sample noise distribution toward the target. At the marginal level, the induced density path follows a prescribed stochastic interpolant between the noise and target distributions, specifically constructed to respect the underlying Riemannian geometry. In contrast to related generative modeling approaches that rely on machine learning, our method is entirely training-free. It instead builds on iterative posterior sampling procedures using only standard Monte Carlo techniques, thereby extending recent diffusion-based sampling methodologies beyond the Euclidean setting. We complement our approach with a rigorous theoretical analysis and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of multi-modal sampling problems, including high-dimensional and heavy-tailed examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Fidelity Generative Audio Compression at 0.275kbps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00648</link><description>arXiv:2602.00648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity general audio compression at ultra-low bitrates is crucial for applications ranging from low-bandwidth communication to generative audio-language modeling. Traditional audio compression methods and contemporary neural codecs are fundamentally designed for waveform reconstruction. As a result, when operating at ultra-low bitrates, these methods degrade rapidly and often fail to preserve essential information, leading to severe acoustic artifacts and pronounced semantic distortion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Generative Audio Compression (GAC), a novel paradigm shift from signal fidelity to task-oriented effectiveness. Implemented within the AI Flow framework, GAC is theoretically grounded in the Law of Information Capacity. These foundations posit that abundant computational power can be leveraged at the receiver to offset extreme communication bottlenecks--exemplifying the More Computation, Less Bandwidth philosophy. By integrating semantic understanding at the transmitter with scalable generative synthesis at the receiver, GAC offloads the information burden to powerful model priors. Our 1.8B-parameter model achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of 32kHz general audio at an unprecedented bitrate of 0.275kbps. Even at 0.175kbps, it still preserves a strong intelligible audio transmission capability, which represents an about 3000x compression ratio, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art neural codecs in maintaining both perceptual quality and semantic consistency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00648v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of Distortions in High-Dimensional Guided Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00716</link><description>arXiv:2602.00716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto standard for conditional sampling in diffusion models, yet it often leads to a loss of diversity in generated samples. We formalize this phenomenon as generative distortion, defined as the mismatch between the CFG-induced sampling distribution and the true conditional distribution. Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage. Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated guidance schedule featuring a negative-guidance window, which mitigates loss of diversity while preserving class separability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00716v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A New Workflow for Materials Discovery Bridging the Gap Between Experimental Databases and Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00756</link><description>arXiv:2602.00756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating Machine Learning (ML) into material property prediction has become a crucial step in accelerating materials discovery. A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00756v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Controlling Repetition in Protein Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00782</link><description>arXiv:2602.00782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have enabled advances in structure prediction and de novo protein design, yet they frequently collapse into pathological repetition during generation. Unlike in text, where repetition merely reduces readability, in proteins it undermines structural confidence and functional viability. To unify this problem, we present the first systematic study of repetition in PLMs. We first propose quantitative metrics to characterize motif-level and homopolymer repetition and then demonstrate their negative impact on folding reliability. To address this challenge, we propose UCCS (Utility-Controlled Contrastive Steering), which steers protein generation with a constrained dataset. Instead of naively contrasting high- vs. low-repetition sequences, we construct contrastive sets that maximize differences in repetition while tightly controlling for structural utility. This disentanglement yields steering vectors that specifically target repetition without degrading foldability. Injected at inference, these vectors consistently reduce repetition without retraining or heuristic decoding. Experiments with ESM-3 and ProtGPT2 in CATH, UniRef50, and SCOP show that our method outperforms decoding penalties and other baselines, substantially lowering repetition while preserving AlphaFold confidence scores. Our results establish repetition control as a central challenge for PLMs and highlight dataset-guided steering as a principled approach for reliable protein generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00782v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analysis of Hessian Scaling for Local and Global Costs in Variational Quantum Algorithm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00783</link><description>arXiv:2602.00783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barren plateaus are typically characterized by vanishing gradients, yet the feasibility of curvature-based optimization fundamentally relies on the statistical resolvability of the Hessian matrix. In this work, we quantify the entrywise resolvability of the Hessian for Variational Quantum Algorithms at random initialization. By leveraging exact second-order parameter-shift rules, we derive a structural representation that reduces the variance of Hessian entries to a finite covariance quadratic form of shifted cost evaluations. This framework reveals two distinct scaling regimes that govern the sample complexity required to resolve Hessian entries against shot noise. For global objectives, we prove that Hessian variances are exponentially suppressed, implying that the number of measurement shots must scale as $O(e^{\alpha n})$ with the number of qubits $n$ to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, for termwise local objectives in bounded-depth circuits, the variance decay is polynomial and explicitly controlled by the backward lightcone growth on the interaction graph, ensuring that curvature information remains statistically accessible with $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ shots. Extensive numerical experiments across varying system sizes and circuit depths demonstrate these theoretical bounds and the associated sampling costs. Our results provide a rigorous criterion for the computational tractability of second-order methods at initialization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00783v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Denoising deterministic networks using iterative Fourier transforms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00790</link><description>arXiv:2602.00790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail a novel Fourier-based approach (IterativeFT) for identifying deterministic network structure in the presence of both edge pruning and Gaussian noise. This technique involves the iterative execution of forward and inverse 2D discrete Fourier transforms on a target network adjacency matrix. The denoising ability of the method is achieved via the application of a sparsification operation to both the real and frequency domain representations of the adjacency matrix with algorithm convergence achieved when the real domain sparsity pattern stabilizes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we apply it to noisy versions of several deterministic models including Kautz, lattice, tree and bipartite networks. For contrast, we also evaluate preferential attachment networks to illustrate the behavior on stochastic graphs. We compare the performance of IterativeFT against simple real domain and frequency domain thresholding, reduced rank reconstruction and locally adaptive network sparsification. Relative to the comparison network denoising approaches, the proposed IterativeFT method provides the best overall performance for lattice and Kuatz networks with competitive performance on tree and bipartite networks. Importantly, the InterativeFT technique is effective at both filtering noisy edges and recovering true edges that are missing from the observed network.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00790v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-Flow Encoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00797</link><description>arXiv:2602.00797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based methods have achieved significant success in various generative modeling tasks, capturing nuanced details within complex data distributions. However, few existing works have exploited this unique capability to resolve fine-grained structural details beyond generation tasks. This paper presents a flow-inspired framework for representation learning. First, we demonstrate that a rectified flow trained using independent coupling is zero everywhere at $t=0.5$ if and only if the source and target distributions are identical. We term this property the \emph{zero-flow criterion}. Second, we show that this criterion can certify conditional independence, thereby extracting \emph{sufficient information} from the data. Third, we translate this criterion into a tractable, simulation-free loss function that enables learning amortized Markov blankets in graphical models and latent representations in self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Accurate Hessian spectra of foundation models have remained out of reach, leading most prior work to rely on small models or strong structural approximations. We show that faithful spectral analysis of the true Hessian is tractable at frontier scale. Using shard-local finite-difference Hessian vector products compatible with Fully Sharded Data Parallelism, we perform stochastic Lanczos quadrature on open-source language models with up to 100B parameters, producing the first large-scale spectral density estimates beyond the sub-10B regime. We characterize the numerical behavior of this pipeline, including finite-difference bias, floating-point noise amplification, and their effect on Krylov stability in fp32 and bf16, and derive practical operating regimes that are validated empirically. We further provide end-to-end runtime and memory scaling laws, showing that full-operator spectral probing incurs only a modest constant-factor overhead over first-order training. Crucially, direct access to the Hessian reveals that widely used block-diagonal curvature approximations can fail catastrophically, exhibiting order-one relative error and poor directional alignment even in mid-scale LLMs. Together, our results demonstrate that foundation-model Hessian spectra are both computable and qualitatively misrepresented by prevailing approximations, opening the door to principled curvature-based analysis at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Safety-Efficacy Trade Off: Robustness against Data-Poisoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00822</link><description>arXiv:2602.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor and data poisoning attacks can achieve high attack success while evading existing spectral and optimisation based defences. We show that this behaviour is not incidental, but arises from a fundamental geometric mechanism in input space. Using kernel ridge regression as an exact model of wide neural networks, we prove that clustered dirty label poisons induce a rank one spike in the input Hessian whose magnitude scales quadratically with attack efficacy. Crucially, for nonlinear kernels we identify a near clone regime in which poison efficacy remains order one while the induced input curvature vanishes, making the attack provably spectrally undetectable. We further show that input gradient regularisation contracts poison aligned Fisher and Hessian eigenmodes under gradient flow, yielding an explicit and unavoidable safety efficacy trade off by reducing data fitting capacity. For exponential kernels, this defence admits a precise interpretation as an anisotropic high pass filter that increases the effective length scale and suppresses near clone poisons. Extensive experiments on linear models and deep convolutional networks across MNIST and CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 validate the theory, demonstrating consistent lags between attack success and spectral visibility, and showing that regularisation and data augmentation jointly suppress poisoning. Our results establish when backdoors are inherently invisible, and provide the first end to end characterisation of poisoning, detectability, and defence through input space curvature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Harmful Overfitting in Sobolev Spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00825</link><description>arXiv:2602.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on benign overfitting in overparameterized machine learning, we study the generalization behavior of functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{k, p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ that perfectly fit a noisy training data set. Under assumptions of label noise and sufficient regularity in the data distribution, we show that approximately norm-minimizing interpolators, which are canonical solutions selected by smoothness bias, exhibit harmful overfitting: even as the training sample size $n \to \infty$, the generalization error remains bounded below by a positive constant with high probability. Our results hold for arbitrary values of $p \in [1, \infty)$, in contrast to prior results studying the Hilbert space case ($p = 2$) using kernel methods. Our proof uses a geometric argument which identifies harmful neighborhoods of the training data using Sobolev inequalities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00825v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Score-based Metropolis-Hastings for Fractional Langevin Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00835</link><description>arXiv:2602.00835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from heavy-tailed and multimodal distributions is challenging when neither the target density nor the proposal density can be evaluated, as in $\alpha$-stable L\'evy-driven fractional Langevin algorithms. While the target distribution can be estimated from data via score-based or energy-based models, the $\alpha$-stable proposal density and its score are generally unavailable, rendering classical density-based Metropolis--Hastings (MH) corrections impractical. Consequently, existing fractional Langevin methods operate in an unadjusted regime and can exhibit substantial finite-time errors and poor empirical control of tail behavior. We introduce the Metropolis-Adjusted Fractional Langevin Algorithm (MAFLA), an MH-inspired, fully score-based correction mechanism. MAFLA employs designed proxies for fractional proposal score gradients under isotropic symmetric $\alpha$-stable noise and learns an acceptance function via Score Balance Matching. We empirically illustrate the strong performance of MAFLA on a series of tasks including combinatorial optimization problems where the method significantly improves finite time sampling accuracy over unadjusted fractional Langevin dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00835v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation via Distributionally Robust Regularization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00844</link><description>arXiv:2602.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) imputation is often compromised by mismatch between observed and true data distributions -- a bias exacerbated by non-stationarity and systematic missingness. Standard methods that minimize reconstruction error or encourage distributional alignment risk overfitting these biased observations. We propose the Distributionally Robust Regularized Imputer Objective (DRIO), which jointly minimizes reconstruction error and the divergence between the imputer and a worst-case distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set. We derive a tractable dual formulation that reduces infinite-dimensional optimization over measures to adversarial search over sample trajectories, and propose an adversarial learning algorithm compatible with flexible deep learning backbones. Comprehensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show DRIO consistently improves imputation under both missing-completely-at-random and missing-not-at-random settings, reaching Pareto-optimal trade-offs between reconstruction accuracy and distributional alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00844v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sublinear Time Quantum Algorithm for Attention Approximation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00874</link><description>arXiv:2602.00874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the query, key and value matrices $Q, K, V\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, the attention module is defined as $\mathrm{Att}(Q, K, V)=D^{-1}AV$ where $A=\exp(QK^\top/\sqrt{d})$ with $\exp(\cdot)$ applied entrywise, $D=\mathrm{diag}(A{\bf 1}_n)$. The attention module is the backbone of modern transformers and large language models, but explicitly forming the softmax matrix $D^{-1}A$ incurs $\Omega(n^2)$ time, motivating numerous approximation schemes that reduce runtime to $\widetilde O(nd)$ via sparsity or low-rank factorization.
  We propose a quantum data structure that approximates any row of $\mathrm{Att}(Q, K, V)$ using only row queries to $Q, K, V$. Our algorithm preprocesses these matrices in $\widetilde{O}\left( \epsilon^{-1} n^{0.5} \left( s_\lambda^{2.5} + s_\lambda^{1.5} d + \alpha^{0.5} d \right) \right)$ time, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy, $s_\lambda$ is the $\lambda$-statistical dimension of the exponential kernel defined by $Q$ and $K$, and $\alpha$ measures the row distortion of $V$ that is at most $d/{\rm srank}(V)$, the stable rank of $V$. Each row query can be answered in $\widetilde{O}(s_\lambda^2 + s_\lambda d)$ time.
  To our knowledge, this is the first quantum data structure that approximates rows of the attention matrix in sublinear time with respect to $n$. Our approach relies on a quantum Nystr\"om approximation of the exponential kernel, quantum multivariate mean estimation for computing $D$, and quantum leverage score sampling for the multiplication with $V$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00874v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Convergence of Jacobian-Free Backpropagation for Optimal Control Problems with Implicit Hamiltonians</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00921</link><description>arXiv:2602.00921v1 Announce Type: cross

We further demonstrate scalability on substantially higher-dimensional problems, including multi-agent optimal consumption and swarm-based quadrotor and bicycle control. Together, our results provide both theoretical justification and empirical evidence for using JFB in high-dimensional optimal control with implicit Hamiltonians.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00921v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Minimax Estimation Rates for Contaminated Mixture of Multinomial Logistic Experts via Expert Heterogeneity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00939</link><description>arXiv:2602.00939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contaminated mixture of experts (MoE) is motivated by transfer learning methods where a pre-trained model, acting as a frozen expert, is integrated with an adapter model, functioning as a trainable expert, in order to learn a new task. Despite recent efforts to analyze the convergence behavior of parameter estimation in this model, there are still two unresolved problems in the literature. First, the contaminated MoE model has been studied solely in regression settings, while its theoretical foundation in classification settings remains absent. Second, previous works on MoE models for classification capture pointwise convergence rates for parameter estimation without any guaranty of minimax optimality. In this work, we close these gaps by performing, for the first time, the convergence analysis of a contaminated mixture of multinomial logistic experts with homogeneous and heterogeneous structures, respectively. In each regime, we characterize uniform convergence rates for estimating parameters under challenging settings where ground-truth parameters vary with the sample size. Furthermore, we also establish corresponding minimax lower bounds to ensure that these rates are minimax optimal. Notably, our theories offer an important insight into the design of contaminated MoE, that is, expert heterogeneity yields faster parameter estimation rates and, therefore, is more sample-efficient than expert homogeneity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00939v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
