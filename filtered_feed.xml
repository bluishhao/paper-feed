Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy poses significant public health challenges, particularly in Japan where proactive vaccination recommendations were suspended from 2013 to 2021. The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication. The architecture enables verified information delivery with source attribution while providing systematic public discourse analysis, with a transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10718v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do You Trust Me? Cognitive-Affective Signatures of Trustworthiness in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10719</link><description>arXiv:2601.10719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceived trustworthiness underpins how users navigate online information, yet it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs),increasingly embedded in search, recommendation, and conversational systems, represent this construct in psychologically coherent ways. We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online. These findings demonstrate that modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, offering a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trust-worthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

Abstract: Continuum robots (CRs), owing to their compact structure, inherent compliance, and flexible deformation, have been widely applied in various fields. By coordinating multiple CRs to form collaborative continuum robots (CCRs), task adaptability, workspace, flexibility, load capacity, and operational stability can be further improved, thus offering significant advantages. In recent years, interest in this emerging field has grown steadily within the continuum-robotics community, accompanied by a consistent rise in related publications. By presenting a comprehensive overview of recent progress from different system-architecture levels, this survey provides a clear framework for research on CCRs. First, CCRs are classified into the three collaboration modes of separated collaboration, assistance collaboration, and parallel collaboration, with definitions provided. Next, advances in structural design, modeling, motion planning, and control for each mode are systematically summarized. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for CCRs are discussed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Survey of Real-Time Support, Analysis, and Advancements in ROS 2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10722</link><description>arXiv:2601.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS~2) has emerged as a relevant middleware framework for robotic applications, offering modularity, distributed execution, and communication. In the last six years, ROS~2 has drawn increasing attention from the real-time systems community and industry. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of research efforts that analyze, enhance, and extend ROS~2 to support real-time execution. We first provide a detailed description of the internal scheduling mechanisms of ROS~2 and its layered architecture, including the interaction with DDS-based communication and other communication middleware. We then review key contributions from the literature, covering timing analysis for both single- and multi-threaded executors, metrics such as response time, reaction time, and data age, and different communication modes. The survey also discusses community-driven enhancements to the ROS~2 runtime, including new executor algorithm designs, real-time GPU management, and microcontroller support via micro-ROS. Furthermore, we summarize techniques for bounding DDS communication delays, message filters, and profiling tools that have been developed to support analysis and experimentation. To help systematize this growing body of work, we introduce taxonomies that classify the surveyed contributions based on different criteria. This survey aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in understanding and improving the real-time capabilities of ROS~2.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10722v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Energy-Efficient Omnidirectional Locomotion for Wheeled Quadrupeds via Predictive Energy-Aware Nominal Gait Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10723</link><description>arXiv:2601.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the versatility of legs, but face significant energy optimization challenges when navigating diverse environments. In this work, we present a hierarchical control framework that integrates predictive power modeling with residual reinforcement learning to optimize omnidirectional locomotion efficiency for wheeled quadrupedal robots. Our approach employs a novel power prediction network that forecasts energy consumption across different gait patterns over a 1-second horizon, enabling intelligent selection of the most energy-efficient nominal gait. A reinforcement learning policy then generates residual adjustments to this nominal gait, fine-tuning the robot's actions to balance energy efficiency with performance objectives. Comparative analysis shows our method reduces energy consumption by up to 35\% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a modified Unitree Go1 platform, demonstrating robust performance even under external disturbances.

Abstract: Multi-robot formation control has various applications in domains such as vehicle troops, platoons, payload transportation, and surveillance. Maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon requires designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters while maintaining a predefined safe distance between the robots. A crucial challenge in this context is dealing with the unknown/uncertain friction forces between wheels and the ground, which vary with changes in road surface, wear in tires, and speed of the vehicle. Although state-of-the-art adaptive controllers can handle a priori bounded uncertainties, they struggle with accurately modeling and identifying frictional forces, which are often state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded.
  This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons that can handle the unknown and complex behavior of frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures. The controller uses the adaptive sliding mode control techniques to regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance, even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This approach involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates the desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; and second, the dynamics model generates the commands to achieve the desired motion. By separating the kinematics and dynamics of the robot, this approach can simplify the control problem and allow for more efficient and robust control of the wheeled mobile robot.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10724v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Formation Navigation Using Diffusion-Based Trajectory Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10725</link><description>arXiv:2601.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based planner for leader--follower formation control in cluttered environments. The diffusion policy is used to generate the trajectory of the midpoint of two leaders as a rigid bar in the plane, thereby defining their desired motion paths in a planar formation. While the followers track the leaders and form desired foramtion geometry using a distance-constrained formation controller based only on the relative positions in followers' local coordinates. The proposed approach produces smooth motions and low tracking errors, with most failures occurring in narrow obstacle-free space, or obstacle configurations that are not in the training data set. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models for reliable multi-agent formation planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Building AI Agents to Improve Job Referral Requests to Strangers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10726</link><description>arXiv:2601.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops AI agents that help job seekers write effective requests for job referrals in a professional online community. The basic workflow consists of an improver agent that rewrites the referral request and an evaluator agent that measures the quality of revisions using a model trained to predict the probability of receiving referrals from other users. Revisions suggested by the LLM (large language model) increase predicted success rates for weaker requests while reducing them for stronger requests. Enhancing the LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevents edits that worsen stronger requests while it amplifies improvements for weaker requests. Overall, using LLM revisions with RAG increases the predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14\% without degrading performance on stronger requests. Although improvements in model-predicted success do not guarantee more referrals in the real world, they provide low-cost signals for promising features before running higher-stakes experiments on real users.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10726v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ORBITFLOW: SLO-Aware Long-Context LLM Serving with Fine-Grained KV Cache Reconfiguration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10729</link><description>arXiv:2601.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serving long-context LLMs is challenging because request lengths and batch composition vary during token generation, causing the memory footprint to fluctuate significantly at runtime. Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10729v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CTHA: Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture for Stable Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10738</link><description>arXiv:2601.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multi-time-scale agent architectures have extended the ubiquitous single-loop paradigm by introducing temporal hierarchies with distinct cognitive layers. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10738v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neuro-Symbolic Activation Discovery: Transferring Mathematical Structures from Physics to Ecology for Parameter-Efficient Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10740</link><description>arXiv:2601.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neural networks rely on generic activation functions (ReLU, GELU, SiLU) that ignore the mathematical structure inherent in scientific data. We propose Neuro-Symbolic Activation Discovery, a framework that uses Genetic Programming to extract interpretable mathematical formulas from data and inject them as custom activation functions. Our key contribution is the discovery of a Geometric Transfer phenomenon: activation functions learned from particle physics data successfully generalize to ecological classification, outperforming standard activations (ReLU, GELU, SiLU) in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. On the Forest Cover dataset, our Hybrid Transfer model achieves 82.4% accuracy with only 5,825 parameters, compared to 83.4% accuracy requiring 31,801 parameters for a conventional heavy network -- a 5.5x parameter reduction with only 1% accuracy loss. We introduce a Parameter Efficiency Score ($E_{param} = AUC / \log_{10}(Params)$) and demonstrate that lightweight hybrid architectures consistently achieve 18-21% higher efficiency than over-parameterized baselines. Crucially, we establish boundary conditions: while Physics to Ecology transfer succeeds (both involve continuous Euclidean measurements), Physics to Text transfer fails (discrete word frequencies require different mathematical structures). Our work opens pathways toward domain-specific activation libraries for efficient scientific machine learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10740v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Line-based Event Preprocessing: Towards Low-Energy Neuromorphic Computer Vision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10742</link><description>arXiv:2601.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic vision made significant progress in recent years, thanks to the natural match between spiking neural networks and event data in terms of biological inspiration, energy savings, latency and memory use for dynamic visual data processing. However, optimising its energy requirements still remains a challenge within the community, especially for embedded applications. One solution may reside in preprocessing events to optimise data quantity thus lowering the energy cost on neuromorphic hardware, proportional to the number of synaptic operations. To this end, we extend an end-to-end neuromorphic line detection mechanism to introduce line-based event data preprocessing. Our results demonstrate on three benchmark event-based datasets that preprocessing leads to an advantageous trade-off between energy consumption and classification performance. Depending on the line-based preprocessing strategy and the complexity of the classification task, we show that one can maintain or increase the classification accuracy while significantly reducing the theoretical energy consumption. Our approach systematically leads to a significant improvement of the neuromorphic classification efficiency, thus laying the groundwork towards a more frugal neuromorphic computer vision thanks to event preprocessing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explore with Long-term Memory: A Benchmark and Multimodal LLM-based Reinforcement Learning Framework for Embodied Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10744</link><description>arXiv:2601.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ideal embodied agent should possess lifelong learning capabilities to handle long-horizon and complex tasks, enabling continuous operation in general environments. This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chatting with Confidants or Corporations? Privacy Management with AI Companions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10754</link><description>arXiv:2601.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI chatbots designed as emotional companions blur the boundaries between interpersonal intimacy and institutional software, creating a complex, multi-dimensional privacy environment. Drawing on Communication Privacy Management theory and Masur's horizontal (user-AI) and vertical (user-platform) privacy framework, we conducted in-depth interviews with fifteen users of companion AI platforms such as Replika and Character.AI. Our findings reveal that users blend interpersonal habits with institutional awareness: while the non-judgmental, always-available nature of chatbots fosters emotional safety and encourages self-disclosure, users remain mindful of institutional risks and actively manage privacy through layered strategies and selective sharing. Despite this, many feel uncertain or powerless regarding platform-level data control. Anthropomorphic design further blurs privacy boundaries, sometimes leading to unintentional oversharing and privacy turbulence. These results extend privacy theory by highlighting the unique interplay of emotional and institutional privacy management in human-AI companionship.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10754v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Too Helpful to Be Safe: User-Mediated Attacks on Planning and Web-Use Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10758</link><description>arXiv:2601.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agents to move beyond conversation toward end-to-end task execution and become more helpful. However, this helpfulness introduces new security risks stem less from direct interface abuse than from acting on user-provided content. Existing studies on agent security largely focus on model-internal vulnerabilities or adversarial access to agent interfaces, overlooking attacks that exploit users as unintended conduits. In this paper, we study user-mediated attacks, where benign users are tricked into relaying untrusted or attacker-controlled content to agents, and analyze how commercial LLM agents respond under such conditions. We conduct a systematic evaluation of 12 commercial agents in a sandboxed environment, covering 6 trip-planning agents and 6 web-use agents, and compare agent behavior across scenarios with no, soft, and hard user-requested safety checks. Our results show that agents are too helpful to be safe by default. Without explicit safety requests, trip-planning agents bypass safety constraints in over 92% of cases, converting unverified content into confident booking guidance. Web-use agents exhibit near-deterministic execution of risky actions, with 9 out of 17 supported tests reaching a 100% bypass rate. Even when users express soft or hard safety intent, constraint bypass remains substantial, reaching up to 54.7% and 7% for trip-planning agents, respectively. These findings reveal that the primary issue is not a lack of safety capability, but its prioritization. Agents invoke safety checks only conditionally when explicitly prompted, and otherwise default to goal-driven execution. Moreover, agents lack clear task boundaries and stopping rules, frequently over-executing workflows in ways that lead to unnecessary data disclosure and real-world harm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10758v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pruning as Evolution: Emergent Sparsity Through Selection Dynamics in Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10765</link><description>arXiv:2601.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are commonly trained in highly overparameterized regimes, yet empirical evidence consistently shows that many parameters become redundant during learning. Most existing pruning approaches impose sparsity through explicit intervention, such as importance-based thresholding or regularization penalties, implicitly treating pruning as a centralized decision applied to a trained model. This assumption is misaligned with the decentralized, stochastic, and path-dependent character of gradient-based training. We propose an evolutionary perspective on pruning: parameter groups (neurons, filters, heads) are modeled as populations whose influence evolves continuously under selection pressure. Under this view, pruning corresponds to population extinction: components with persistently low fitness gradually lose influence and can be removed without discrete pruning schedules and without requiring equilibrium computation. We formalize neural pruning as an evolutionary process over population masses, derive selection dynamics governing mass evolution, and connect fitness to local learning signals. We validate the framework on MNIST using a population-scaled MLP (784--512--256--10) with 768 prunable neuron populations. All dynamics reach dense baselines near 98\% test accuracy. We benchmark post-training hard pruning at target sparsity levels (35--50\%): pruning 35\% yields $\approx$95.5\% test accuracy, while pruning 50\% yields $\approx$88.3--88.6\%, depending on the dynamic. These results demonstrate that evolutionary selection produces a measurable accuracy--sparsity tradeoff without explicit pruning schedules during training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10765v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unifying Speech Recognition, Synthesis and Conversion with Autoregressive Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10770</link><description>arXiv:2601.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional speech systems typically rely on separate, task-specific models for text-to-speech (TTS), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and voice conversion (VC), resulting in fragmented pipelines that limit scalability, efficiency, and cross-task generalization. In this paper, we present General-Purpose Audio (GPA), a unified audio foundation model that integrates multiple core speech tasks within a single large language model (LLM) architecture. GPA operates on a shared discrete audio token space and supports instruction-driven task induction, enabling a single autoregressive model to flexibly perform TTS, ASR, and VC without architectural modifications. This unified design combines a fully autoregressive formulation over discrete speech tokens, joint multi-task training across speech domains, and a scalable inference pipeline that achieves high concurrency and throughput. The resulting model family supports efficient multi-scale deployment, including a lightweight 0.3B-parameter variant optimized for edge and resource-constrained environments. Together, these design choices demonstrate that a unified autoregressive architecture can achieve competitive performance across diverse speech tasks while remaining viable for low-latency, practical deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10770v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Resource-Bounded Martin-L\"of Type Theory: Compositional Cost Analysis for Dependent Types</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10772</link><description>arXiv:2601.10772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend resource-bounded type theory to Martin-Lof type theory (MLTT) with dependent types, enabling size-indexed cost bounds for programs over inductive families.
  We introduce a resource-indexed universe hierarchy U_r where r is an element of L and tracks the cost of type formation, and a graded modality Box_r for feasibility certification. Our main results are: (1) a cost soundness theorem showing that synthesized bounds over-approximate operational costs, with bounds expressed as functions of size indices; (2) a semantic model in the presheaf topos over L, extended with dependent presheaves and a comprehension structure; (3) canonicity for the intensional fragment; and (4) initiality of the syntactic model. We demonstrate the framework with case studies including length-indexed vector operations with linear bounds and binary search with logarithmic bounds, both expressed in the type.
  This work bridges the gap between dependent type theory and quantitative resource analysis, enabling certified cost bounds for size-dependent algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LogicLens: Leveraging Semantic Code Graph to explore Multi Repository large systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10773</link><description>arXiv:2601.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding large software systems is a challenging task, especially when code is distributed across multiple repositories and microservices. Developers often need to reason not only about the structure of the code, but also about its domain logic and runtime behaviors, which are typically implicit and scattered. We introduce LogicLens, a reactive conversational agent that assists developers in exploring complex software systems through a semantic multi-repository graph. This graph is built in a preprocessing step by combining syntactic code analysis, via AST parsing and repository traversal, with semantic enrichment using Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting graph captures both structural elements, such as files, classes, and functions, as well as functional abstractions like domain entities, operations, and workflows. Once the graph is constructed, LogicLens enables developers to interact with it via natural language, dynamically retrieving relevant subgraphs and answering technical or functional queries. We present the architecture of the system, discuss emergent behaviors, and evaluate its effectiveness on real-world multi-repository scenarios. We demonstrate emergent capabilities including impact analysis and symptom-based debugging that arise naturally from the semantic graph structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10773v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analytic Bijections for Smooth and Interpretable Normalizing Flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10774</link><description>arXiv:2601.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $\phi^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10774v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs for Game Theory: Entropy-Guided In-Context Learning and Adaptive CoT Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10775</link><description>arXiv:2601.10775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel LLM-based framework for reasoning in discrete, game-theoretic tasks, illustrated with \emph{Tic-Tac-Toe}. The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \(-11.6\%\) with the baseline LLM to \(+9.5\%\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10775v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Entropy of a Random Geometric Graph</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10778</link><description>arXiv:2601.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the entropy of a hard random geometric graph (RGG), a commonly used model for spatial networks, where the connectivity is governed by the distances between the nodes. Formally, given a connection range $r$, a hard RGG $G_m$ on $m$ vertices is formed by drawing $m$ random points from a spatial domain, and then connecting any two points with an edge when they are within a distance $r$ from each other. The two domains we consider are the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$ and the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. We derive upper bounds on the entropy $H(G_m)$ for both these domains and for all possible values of $r$. In a few cases, we obtain an exact asymptotic characterization of the entropy by proving a tight lower bound. Our main results are that $H(G_m) \sim dm \log_2m$ for $0 &lt; r \leq 1/4$ in the case of $\mathbb{T}^d$ and that the entropy of a one-dimensional RGG on $[0,1]$ behaves like $m\log m$ for all $0&lt;1$. As a consequence, we can infer that the asymptotic structural entropy of an RGG on $\mathbb{T}^d$, which is the entropy of an unlabelled RGG, is $\Omega((d-1)m \log_2m)$ for $0 &lt; r \leq 1/4$. For the rest of the cases, we conjecture that the entropy behaves asymptotically as the leading order terms of our derived upper bounds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10778v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unified Optimization of Source Weights and Transfer Quantities in Multi-Source Transfer Learning: An Asymptotic Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10779</link><description>arXiv:2601.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning plays a vital role in improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios. However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10779v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Future Optical Flow Prediction Improves Robot Control &amp; Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10781</link><description>arXiv:2601.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future motion representations, such as optical flow, offer immense value for control and generative tasks. However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10781v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bidirectional Human-Robot Communication for Physical Human-Robot Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10796</link><description>arXiv:2601.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective physical human-robot interaction requires systems that are not only adaptable to user preferences but also transparent about their actions. This paper introduces BRIDGE, a system for bidirectional human-robot communication in physical assistance. Our method allows users to modify a robot's planned trajectory -- position, velocity, and force -- in real time using natural language. We utilize a large language model (LLM) to interpret any trajectory modifications implied by user commands in the context of the planned motion and conversation history. Importantly, our system provides verbal feedback in response to the user, either assuring any resulting changes or posing a clarifying question. We evaluated our method in a user study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks, comparing BRIDGE to an ablation without verbal feedback and a baseline. Results show that participants successfully used the system to modify trajectories in real time. Moreover, the bidirectional feedback led to significantly higher ratings of interactivity and transparency, demonstrating that the robot's verbal response is critical for a more intuitive user experience.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of Tensor Network (TN) models $\unicode{x2013}$ Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) $\unicode{x2013}$ for real-time jet tagging in high-energy physics, with a focus on low-latency deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ICONIC-444: A 3.1-Million-Image Dataset for OOD Detection Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10802</link><description>arXiv:2601.10802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current progress in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is limited by the lack of large, high-quality datasets with clearly defined OOD categories across varying difficulty levels (near- to far-OOD) that support both fine- and coarse-grained computer vision tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce ICONIC-444 (Image Classification and OOD Detection with Numerous Intricate Complexities), a specialized large-scale industrial image dataset containing over 3.1 million RGB images spanning 444 classes tailored for OOD detection research. Captured with a prototype industrial sorting machine, ICONIC-444 closely mimics real-world tasks. It complements existing datasets by offering structured, diverse data suited for rigorous OOD evaluation across a spectrum of task complexities. We define four reference tasks within ICONIC-444 to benchmark and advance OOD detection research and provide baseline results for 22 state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10802v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BYOL: Bring Your Own Language Into LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10804</link><description>arXiv:2601.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet remain fundamentally constrained by the severe imbalance in global language resources. While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol .</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient LLR-Domain Decoding of ABS+ Polar Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10808</link><description>arXiv:2601.10808v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Style features such as friendly, helpful, or concise are widely used in prompts to steer the behavior of Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agents, yet their unintended side effects remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic study of cross-feature stylistic side effects. We conduct a comprehensive survey of 127 conversational agent papers from ACL Anthology and identify 12 frequently used style features. Using controlled, synthetic dialogues across task-oriented and open domain settings, we quantify how prompting for one style feature causally affects others via a pairwise LLM as a Judge evaluation framework. Our results reveal consistent and structured side effects, such as prompting for conciseness significantly reduces perceived expertise. They demonstrate that style features are deeply entangled rather than orthogonal. To support future research, we introduce CASSE (Conversational Agent Stylistic Side Effects), a dataset capturing these complex interactions. We further evaluate prompt based and activation steering based mitigation strategies and find that while they can partially restore suppressed traits, they often degrade the primary intended style. These findings challenge the assumption of faithful style control in LLMs and highlight the need for multi-objective and more principled approaches to safe, targeted stylistic steering in conversational agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10809v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Digital Metabolism: Decoupling Logic from Facts via Regenerative Unlearning -- Towards a Pure Neural Logic Core</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10810</link><description>arXiv:2601.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) currently suffer from parameter entanglement, where general reasoning capabilities (logic) and specific factual knowledge (facts) exist in a superposition state within shared weights. This coupling leads to the "memory wall," where computational capacity is squandered on simulating retrieval, often resulting in hallucinations. In this paper, we propose "digital metabolism," a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy &lt; 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent "structural crystallization" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the "metabolized" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning). While the causal mechanism underlying this behavioral shift requires further investigation, our findings provide a dynamic weight-level counterpart to architectural innovations like DeepSeek's Engram, paving the way for modular "Neural CPU + Symbolic RAM" architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SurfSLAM: Sim-to-Real Underwater Stereo Reconstruction For Real-Time SLAM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10814</link><description>arXiv:2601.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization and mapping are core perceptual capabilities for underwater robots. Stereo cameras provide a low-cost means of directly estimating metric depth to support these tasks. However, despite recent advances in stereo depth estimation on land, computing depth from image pairs in underwater scenes remains challenging. In underwater environments, images are degraded by light attenuation, visual artifacts, and dynamic lighting conditions. Furthermore, real-world underwater scenes frequently lack rich texture useful for stereo depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. As a result, stereo estimation networks trained on in-air data cannot transfer directly to the underwater domain. In addition, there is a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training of neural networks. Poor underwater depth estimation is compounded in stereo-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, making it a fundamental challenge for underwater robot perception. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enables sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning. We leverage our learned depth predictions to develop \algname, a novel framework for real-time underwater SLAM that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements. Lastly, we collect a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys using an underwater robot. Our dataset features over 24,000 stereo pairs, along with high-quality, dense photogrammetry models and reference trajectories for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed training approach on real-world data for improving stereo estimation in the underwater domain and for enabling accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10814v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified 3D Object Perception Framework for Real-Time Outside-In Multi-Camera Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10819</link><description>arXiv:2601.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D object perception and multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking are fundamental for the digital transformation of industrial infrastructure. However, transitioning "inside-out" autonomous driving models to "outside-in" static camera networks presents significant challenges due to heterogeneous camera placements and extreme occlusion. In this paper, we present an adapted Sparse4D framework specifically optimized for large-scale infrastructure environments. Our system leverages absolute world-coordinate geometric priors and introduces an occlusion-aware ReID embedding module to maintain identity stability across distributed sensor networks. To bridge the Sim2Real domain gap without manual labeling, we employ a generative data augmentation strategy using the NVIDIA COSMOS framework, creating diverse environmental styles that enhance the model's appearance-invariance. Evaluated on the AI City Challenge 2025 benchmark, our camera-only framework achieves a state-of-the-art HOTA of $45.22$. Furthermore, we address real-time deployment constraints by developing an optimized TensorRT plugin for Multi-Scale Deformable Aggregation (MSDA).

Abstract: Recent advances in code generation models have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for automating feature engineering, yet their adoption in real-world ML teams remains constrained by critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of datasets capturing the iterative and complex coding processes of production-level feature engineering, (ii) limited integration and personalization of widely used coding agents, such as CoPilot and Devin, with a team's unique tools, codebases, workflows, and practices, and (iii) suboptimal human-AI collaboration due to poorly timed or insufficient feedback. We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively. In practice, when building features for recommendation models serving over 120 million users, our approach has delivered real-world impact by reducing feature engineering cycles from three weeks to a single day.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10820v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mugi: Value Level Parallelism For Efficient LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10823</link><description>arXiv:2601.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10823v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10825</link><description>arXiv:2601.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities across domains, yet mechanisms underlying sophisticated reasoning remain elusive. Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10825v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Approximately Optimal Global Planning for Contact-Rich SE(2) Manipulation on a Graph of Reachable Sets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10827</link><description>arXiv:2601.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If we consider human manipulation, it is clear that contact-rich manipulation (CRM)-the ability to use any surface of the manipulator to make contact with objects-can be far more efficient and natural than relying solely on end-effectors (i.e., fingertips). However, state-of-the-art model-based planners for CRM are still focused on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit CRM's advantages. We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%. It also achieves a 91% success rate across 250 queries and maintains sub-minute query times, ultimately demonstrating that globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Order Lie Derivatives from Taylor Series in the ADTAYL Package</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10828</link><description>arXiv:2601.10828v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons and prostheses require precise, real time gait phase and step detections to ensure synchronized motion and user safety. Conventional methods often rely on complex force sensing hardware that introduces control latency. This paper presents a minimalist framework utilizing a single, low cost Inertial-Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated into the crutch hand grip, eliminating the need for mechanical modifications. We propose a five phase classification system, including standard gait phases and a non locomotor auxiliary state, to prevent undesired motion. Three deep learning architectures were benchmarked on both a PC and an embedded system. To improve performance under data constrained conditions, models were augmented with a Finite State Machine (FSM) to enforce biomechanical consistency. The Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) emerged as the superior architecture, yielding the highest success rates and lowest latency. Notably, the model generalized to a paralyzed user despite being trained exclusively on healthy participants. Achieving a 94% success rate in detecting crutch steps, this system provides a high performance, cost effective solution for real time exoskeleton control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10832v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can Vision-Language Models Understand Construction Workers?

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10835v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One Model, Many Behaviors: Training-Induced Effects on Out-of-Distribution Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10836</link><description>arXiv:2601.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust and reliable machine-learning systems in open-world settings. Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EncodeRec: An Embedding Backbone for Recommendation Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10837</link><description>arXiv:2601.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent recommender systems increasingly leverage embeddings from large pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, such embeddings exhibit two key limitations: (1) PLMs are not explicitly optimized to produce structured and discriminative embedding spaces, and (2) their representations remain overly generic, often failing to capture the domain-specific semantics crucial for recommendation tasks. We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Qualitative reconstruction methods for imaging interior Robin interfaces in EIT from Robin-to-Dirichlet data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10839</link><description>arXiv:2601.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse shape problem arising in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for nondestructive testing, in which interior defects are modeled through Robin transmission conditions. Unlike classical formulations, we impose Robin boundary conditions on both the exterior measurement surface and the interior interface, and use the Robin-to-Dirichlet (RtD) map as the available data. Within this setting, we develop qualitative (non-iterative) reconstruction methods based on the Linear Sampling Method (LSM) and the Regularized Factorization Method (RFM), and derive new analytical characterizations that enable these methods to identify interior regions. We further propose a numerical implementation that incorporates regularization strategies and demonstrate, through experiments, that the methods reliably reconstruct interior regions of interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10839v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SecMLOps: A Comprehensive Framework for Integrating Security Throughout the MLOps Lifecycle</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10848</link><description>arXiv:2601.10848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal technology in the operation of large and complex systems, driving advancements in fields such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and financial fraud detection. Despite its benefits, the deployment of ML models brings significant security challenges, such as adversarial attacks, which can compromise the integrity and reliability of these systems. To address these challenges, this paper builds upon the concept of Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps), providing a comprehensive framework designed to integrate robust security measures throughout the entire ML operations (MLOps) lifecycle. SecMLOps builds on the principles of MLOps by embedding security considerations from the initial design phase through to deployment and continuous monitoring. This framework is particularly focused on safeguarding against sophisticated attacks that target various stages of the MLOps lifecycle, thereby enhancing the resilience and trustworthiness of ML applications. A detailed advanced pedestrian detection system (PDS) use case demonstrates the practical application of SecMLOps in securing critical MLOps. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we highlight the trade-offs between security measures and system performance, providing critical insights into optimizing security without unduly impacting operational efficiency. Our findings underscore the importance of a balanced approach, offering valuable guidance for practitioners on how to achieve an optimal balance between security and performance in ML deployments across various domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10848v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cooperative UAVs for Remote Data Collection under Limited Communications: An Asynchronous Multiagent Learning Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10849</link><description>arXiv:2601.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint optimization of trajectories and bandwidth allocation for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enhance energy efficiency in the cooperative data collection problem. We focus on an important yet underestimated aspect of the system, where action synchronization across all UAVs is impossible. Since most existing learning-based solutions are not designed to learn in this asynchronous environment, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process and introduce an asynchronous multi-agent learning algorithm to learn UAVs' cooperative policies. Once the UAVs' trajectory policies are learned, the bandwidth allocation can be optimally solved based on local observations at each collection point. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other learning-based and heuristic baselines in terms of both energy efficiency and mission completion time. Additionally, the learned policies exhibit robustness under varying environmental conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Artifact Analysis of Self-Admitted Technical Debt in Scientific Software</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10850</link><description>arXiv:2601.10850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) occurs when developers acknowledge shortcuts in code. In scientific software (SSW), such debt poses unique risks to the validity and reproducibility of results. Objective: This study aims to identify, categorize, and evaluate scientific debt, a specialized form of SATD in SSW, and assess the extent to which traditional SATD categories capture these domain-specific issues. Method: We conduct a multi-artifact analysis across code comments, commit messages, pull requests, and issue trackers from 23 open-source SSW projects. We construct and validate a curated dataset of scientific debt, develop a multi-source SATD classifier, and conduct a practitioner validation to assess the practical relevance of scientific debt. Results: Our classifier performs strongly across 900,358 artifacts from 23 SSW projects. SATD is most prevalent in pull requests and issue trackers, underscoring the value of multi-artifact analysis. Models trained on traditional SATD often miss scientific debt, emphasizing the need for its explicit detection in SSW. Practitioner validation confirmed that scientific debt is both recognizable and useful in practice. Conclusions: Scientific debt represents a unique form of SATD in SSW that that is not adequately captured by traditional categories and requires specialized identification and management. Our dataset, classification analysis, and practitioner validation results provide the first formal multi-artifact perspective on scientific debt, highlighting the need for tailored SATD detection approaches in SSW.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10850v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gamifying Cyber Governance: A Virtual Escape Room to Transform Cybersecurity Policy Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10852</link><description>arXiv:2601.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serious games are gaining popularity as effective teaching and learning tools, providing engaging, interactive, and practical experiences for students. Gamified learning experiences, such as virtual escape rooms, have emerged as powerful tools in bridging theory and practice, fostering deeper understanding and engagement among students. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a virtual escape room tailored specifically for cybersecurity governance and policy education. Developed as a 3D immersive environment, the escape room simulates a virtual company scenario to facilitate risk-informed cyber policy development. It consists of three interactive zones, each offering distinct sets of scenario-based problems that target specific educational objectives. Through these zones, students analyze cybersecurity risks, match security frameworks, and draft appropriate policies, thereby developing critical thinking, decision-making skills, and practical cybersecurity competencies. The primary contribution of this work lies in its innovative integration of game-based learning and immersive technology to create robust, interactive learning materials that are also resilient to generative AI interventions, thereby maintaining academic integrity. Additionally, the escape room provides students with exposure to real-world cybersecurity scenarios in a virtual office environment that meets industry expectations. Results from a student survey indicated strong positive feedback, highlighting significant improvements in students engagement, practical understanding, and enthusiasm toward cybersecurity governance and policy concepts, underscoring the effectiveness and potential of gamification in cybersecurity education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Effects of Different Attention Mechanisms Applied on 3D Models in Video Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10854</link><description>arXiv:2601.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human action recognition has become an important research focus in computer vision due to the wide range of applications where it is used. 3D Resnet-based CNN models, particularly MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D, have different convolutional filters to extract spatiotemporal features. This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D. This paper concludes the significance of missing temporal features in the performance of the newly created increased resolution models. The variants had different behavior on class-level accuracy, despite the similarity of their enhancements to the overall performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10854v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-Guided Human-In-the-Loop Inverse Design of High Performance Engineering Structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10859</link><description>arXiv:2601.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design tools such as Topology Optimization (TO) can achieve new levels of improvement for high-performance engineered structures. However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10859v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Uptime: Actionable Performance Metrics for EV Charging Site Operators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10861</link><description>arXiv:2601.10861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) depends heavily on the reliability of charging infrastructure, yet approximately 1 in 5 drivers report being unable to charge during station visits due to inoperable equipment. While regulatory efforts such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program have established uptime requirements, these metrics are often simplistic, delayed, and fail to provide the diagnostic granularity needed by Charging Site Operators (CSOs). Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications. A case study involving 98 chargers at a California academic institution spanning 2018-2024 demonstrates that these metrics reveal persistent "zombie chargers" and high-frequency network instability that remain hidden in standard annual reporting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10861v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Accuracy: A Stability-Aware Metric for Multi-Horizon Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10863</link><description>arXiv:2601.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10863v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Taint Specification Extraction for Vulnerability Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10865</link><description>arXiv:2601.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools using taint analysis are widely viewed as providing higher-quality vulnerability detection results compared to traditional pattern-based approaches. However, performing static taint analysis for JavaScript poses two major challenges. First, JavaScript's dynamic features complicate data flow extraction required for taint tracking. Second, npm's large library ecosystem makes it difficult to identify relevant sources/sinks and establish taint propagation across dependencies. In this paper, we present SemTaint, a multi-agent system that strategically combines the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional static program analysis to extract taint specifications, including sources, sinks, call edges, and library flow summaries tailored to each package. Conceptually, SemTaint uses static program analysis to calculate a call graph and defers to an LLM to resolve call edges that cannot be resolved statically. Further, it uses the LLM to classify sources and sinks for a given CWE. The resulting taint specification is then provided to a SAST tool, which performs vulnerability analysis. We integrate SemTaint with CodeQL, a state-of-the-art SAST tool, and demonstrate its effectiveness by detecting 106 of 162 vulnerabilities previously undetectable by CodeQL. Furthermore, we find 4 novel vulnerabilities in 4 popular npm packages. In doing so, we demonstrate that LLMs can practically enhance existing static program analysis algorithms, combining the strengths of both symbolic reasoning and semantic understanding for improved vulnerability detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10865v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Privacy Budgeting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10866</link><description>arXiv:2601.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of adaptive privacy budgeting under generalized differential privacy. Consider the setting where each user $i\in [n]$ holds a tuple $x_i\in U:=U_1\times \dotsb \times U_T$, where $x_i(l)\in U_l$ represents the $l$-th component of their data. For every $l\in [T]$ (or a subset), an untrusted analyst wishes to compute some $f_l(x_1(l),\dots,x_n(l))$, while respecting the privacy of each user. For many functions $f_l$, data from the users are not all equally important, and there is potential to use the privacy budgets of the users strategically, leading to privacy savings that can be used to improve the utility of later queries. In particular, the budgeting should be adaptive to the outputs of previous queries, so that greater savings can be achieved on more typical instances. In this paper, we provide such an adaptive budgeting framework, with various applications demonstrating its applicability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10866v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Disturbance Attenuation Regulator I-A: Signal Bound Finite Horizon Solution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10867</link><description>arXiv:2601.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a generalized finite horizon recursive solution to the discrete time signal bound disturbance attenuation regulator (SiDAR) for state feedback control. This problem addresses linear dynamical systems subject to signal bound disturbances, i.e., disturbance sequences whose squared signal two-norm is bounded by a fixed budget. The term generalized indicates that the results accommodate arbitrary initial states. By combining game theory and dynamic programming, we derive a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy valid for arbitrary initial states. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex scalar optimization for the Lagrange multiplier at each stage; the control is then explicit. For fixed disturbance budget $\alpha$, the state space partitions into two distinct regions: $\mathcal{X}_L(\alpha)$, where the optimal control policy is linear and coincides with the standard linear $H_{\infty}$ state feedback control, and $\mathcal{X}_{NL}(\alpha)$, where the optimal control policy is nonlinear. We establish monotonicity and boundedness of the associated Riccati recursions and characterize the geometry of the solution regions. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical properties.

Abstract: This paper establishes convergence and steady-state properties for the signal bound disturbance attenuation regulator (SiDAR). Building on the finite horizon recursive solution developed in a companion paper, we introduce the steady-state SiDAR and derive its tractable linear matrix inequality (LMI) with $O(n^3)$ complexity. Systems are classified as degenerate or nondegenerate based on steady-state solution properties. For nondegenerate systems, the finite horizon solution converges to the steady-state solution for all states as the horizon approaches infinity. For degenerate systems, convergence holds in one region of the state space, while a turnpike arises in the complementary region. When convergence holds, the optimal multiplier and control gain are obtained directly from the LMI solution. Numerical examples illustrate convergence behavior and turnpike phenomena.

Abstract: This paper develops a generalized finite horizon recursive solution to the discrete time stage bound disturbance attenuation regulator (StDAR) for state feedback control. This problem addresses linear dynamical systems subject to stage bound disturbances, i.e., disturbance sequences constrained independently at each time step through stagewise squared two-norm bounds. The term generalized indicates that the results accommodate arbitrary initial states. By combining game theory and dynamic programming, this work derives a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex optimization for the Lagrange multiplier vector at each stage; the control is then explicit.

Abstract: Deep neural networks constructed from linear maps and positively homogeneous nonlinearities (e.g., ReLU) possess a fundamental gauge symmetry: the network function is invariant to node-wise diagonal rescalings. However, standard gradient descent is not equivariant to this symmetry, causing optimization trajectories to depend heavily on arbitrary parameterizations. Prior work has proposed rescaling-invariant optimization schemes for positively homogeneous networks (e.g., path-based or path-space updates). Our contribution is complementary: we formulate the invariance requirement at the level of the backward adjoint/optimization geometry, which provides a simple, operator-level recipe that can be applied uniformly across network components and optimizer state. By replacing the Euclidean transpose with a Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint, we derive UC gauge-consistent steepest descent and backprogation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10873v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Balanced allocation: considerations from large scale service environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10874</link><description>arXiv:2601.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study d-way balanced allocation, which assigns each incoming job to the lightest loaded among d randomly chosen servers. While prior work has extensively studied the performance of the basic scheme, there has been less published work on adapting this technique to many aspects of large-scale systems. Based on our experience in building and running planet-scale cloud applications, we extend the understanding of d-way balanced allocation along the following dimensions:
  (i) Bursts: Events such as breaking news can produce bursts of requests that may temporarily exceed the servicing capacity of the system. Thus, we explore what happens during a burst and how long it takes for the system to recover from such bursts. (ii) Priorities: Production systems need to handle jobs with a mix of priorities (e.g., user facing requests may be high priority while other requests may be low priority). We extend d-way balanced allocation to handle multiple priorities. (iii) Noise: Production systems are often typically distributed and thus d-way balanced allocation must work with stale or incorrect information. Thus we explore the impact of noisy information and their interactions with bursts and priorities.
  We explore the above using both extensive simulations and analytical arguments. Specifically we show, (i) using simulations, that d-way balanced allocation quickly recovers from bursts and can gracefully handle priorities and noise; and (ii) that analysis of the underlying generative models complements our simulations and provides insight into our simulation results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10874v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Medical SAM3: A Foundation Model for Universal Prompt-Driven Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10880</link><description>arXiv:2601.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

The resulting system poses significant computational challenges due to its nonlinear and coupled structure. To achieve stable and reliable simulations of the vortex dynamics and accompanying morphological transitions, we develop a maximum bound preserving, energy-stable implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme. The structure-preserving properties of the scheme are rigorously established, ensuring long-time stability and physical consistency. Through two- and three-dimensional simulations, the hybrid model successfully captures the temporal and spatial formation and alignment of vortices and the suppression of superconductivity under increasing magnetic fields, demonstrating both the accuracy and robustness of the proposed computational approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10887v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sustainable Vertical Heterogeneous Networks: A Cell Switching Approach with High Altitude Platform Station</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10891</link><description>arXiv:2601.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of radio access networks (RANs) is increasing energy consumption and challenging the sustainability of future systems. We consider a dense-urban vertical heterogeneous network (vHetNet) comprising a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as a super macro base station, a terrestrial macro base station (MBS), and multiple small base stations (SBSs). We propose a HAPS-enhanced cell-switching algorithm that selectively deactivates SBSs based on their traffic load and the capacity and channel conditions of both the MBS and HAPS. The resulting energy-minimization problem, subject to an outage-based quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and reformulated into a mixed-integer program for efficient solution. Using realistic 3GPP channel models, simulations show substantial energy savings versus All-ON, terrestrial cell switching, and sorting benchmarks. Relative to All-ON, the proposed method reduces power consumption by up to 77% at low loads and about 40% at high loads; a NoQoS variant achieves up to 90% and 47%, respectively. The approach maintains high served-traffic levels and provides a tunable trade-off between power efficiency and outage-based QoS, supporting scalable and sustainable 6G deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10891v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DialDefer: A Framework for Detecting and Mitigating LLM Dialogic Deference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10896</link><description>arXiv:2601.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used as third-party judges, yet their reliability when evaluating speakers in dialogue remains poorly understood. We show that LLMs judge identical claims differently depending on framing: the same content elicits different verdicts when presented as a statement to verify ("Is this statement correct?") versus attributed to a speaker ("Is this speaker correct?"). We call this dialogic deference and introduce DialDefer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these framing-induced judgment shifts. Our Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) captures directional shifts that aggregate accuracy obscures. Across nine domains, 3k+ instances, and four models, conversational framing induces large shifts (|DDS| up to 87pp, p &lt; .0001) while accuracy remains stable (&lt;2pp), with effects amplifying 2-4x on naturalistic Reddit conversations. Models can shift toward agreement (deference) or disagreement (skepticism) depending on domain -- the same model ranges from DDS = -53 on graduate-level science to +58 on social judgment. Ablations reveal that human-vs-LLM attribution drives the largest shifts (17.7pp swing), suggesting models treat disagreement with humans as more costly than with AI. Mitigation attempts reduce deference but can over-correct into skepticism, framing this as a calibration problem beyond accuracy optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10896v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Streaming Stochastic Submodular Maximization with On-Demand User Requests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10901</link><description>arXiv:2601.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel problem in streaming submodular maximization, inspired by the dynamics of news-recommendation platforms. We consider a setting where users can visit a news website at any time, and upon each visit, the website must display up to $k$ news items. User interactions are inherently stochastic: each news item presented to the user is consumed with a certain acceptance probability by the user, and each news item covers certain topics. Our goal is to design a streaming algorithm that maximizes the expected total topic coverage. To address this problem, we establish a connection to submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint. We show that we can effectively adapt previous methods to address our problem when the number of user visits is known in advance or linear-size memory in the stream length is available. However, in more realistic scenarios where only an upper bound on the visits and sublinear memory is available, the algorithms fail to guarantee any bounded performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new online streaming algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of $1/(8\delta)$, where $\delta$ controls the approximation quality. Moreover, it requires only a single pass over the stream, and uses memory independent of the stream length. Empirically, our algorithms consistently outperform the baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10901v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARC Prize 2025: Technical Report</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10904</link><description>arXiv:2601.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ARC-AGI benchmark series serves as a critical measure of few-shot generalization on novel tasks, a core aspect of intelligence. The ARC Prize 2025 global competition targeted the newly released ARC-AGI-2 dataset, which features greater task complexity compared to its predecessor. The Kaggle competition attracted 1,455 teams and 15,154 entries, with the top score reaching 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set. Paper submissions nearly doubled year-over-year to 90 entries, reflecting the growing research interest in fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. The defining theme of 2025 is the emergence of the refinement loop -- a per-task iterative program optimization loop guided by a feedback signal. Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination. In this paper, we survey the top-performing methods, examine the role of refinement loops in AGI progress, discuss knowledge-dependent overfitting, and preview ARC-AGI-3, which introduces interactive reasoning challenges that require exploration, planning, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10904v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FrankenMotion: Part-level Human Motion Generation and Composition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10909</link><description>arXiv:2601.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training. Our code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10909v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Realistic Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous and Sustainable Marine Vessel Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10911</link><description>arXiv:2601.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainability is becoming increasingly critical in the maritime transport, encompassing both environmental and social impacts, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and navigational safety. Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces. We validate the proposed approach in a sea area of the Indian Ocean, demonstrating its efficacy in enabling sustainable and safe vessel navigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FAConvLSTM: Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM for Efficient Feature Extraction in Multivariate Climate Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10914</link><description>arXiv:2601.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A PAC-Bayesian Analysis of Channel-Induced Degradation in Edge Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10915</link><description>arXiv:2601.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the emerging paradigm of edge inference, neural networks (NNs) are partitioned across distributed edge devices that collaboratively perform inference via wireless transmission. However, standard NNs are generally trained in a noiseless environment, creating a mismatch with the noisy channels during edge deployment. In this paper, we address this issue by characterizing the channel-induced performance deterioration as a generalization error against unseen channels. We introduce an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics directly into the weight space, allowing us to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that explicitly quantifies the impact of wireless distortion. We further provide closed-form expressions for practical channels to demonstrate the tractability of these bounds. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a channel-aware training algorithm that minimizes a surrogate objective based on the derived bound. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve inference accuracy by leveraging channel statistics, without end-to-end re-training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10915v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-learned representation-guided latent diffusion model for breast cancer classification in deep ultraviolet whole surface images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10917</link><description>arXiv:2601.10917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10917v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Induction of Finite-State Transducers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10918</link><description>arXiv:2601.10918v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Robust Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is crucial for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments, where adverse weather conditions can severely degrade model performance and reliability. In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods. On the PASCAL benchmark, RobuMTL delivers a +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations and up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions compared to the MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2, RobuMTL achieves a +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks.

Abstract: We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for Vision-Language Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge, which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as a saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10922v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hidden-in-Plain-Text: A Benchmark for Social-Web Indirect Prompt Injection in RAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10923</link><description>arXiv:2601.10923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems put more and more emphasis on grounding their responses in user-generated content found on the Web, amplifying both their usefulness and their attack surface. Most notably, indirect prompt injection and retrieval poisoning attack the web-native carriers that survive ingestion pipelines and are very concerning. We provide OpenRAG-Soc, a compact, reproducible benchmark-and-harness for web-facing RAG evaluation under these threats, in a discrete data package. The suite combines a social corpus with interchangeable sparse and dense retrievers and deployable mitigations - HTML/Markdown sanitization, Unicode normalization, and attribution-gated answered. It standardizes end-to-end evaluation from ingestion to generation and reports attacks time of one of the responses at answer time, rank shifts in both sparse and dense retrievers, utility and latency, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons across carriers and defenses. OpenRAG-Soc targets practitioners who need fast, and realistic tests to track risk and harden deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10923v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Massively Multilingual Joint Segmentation and Glossing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10925</link><description>arXiv:2601.10925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated interlinear gloss prediction with neural networks is a promising approach to accelerate language documentation efforts. However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.
  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text. We run experiments to determine the optimal way to train models that balance segmentation and glossing accuracy, as well as the alignment between the two tasks. We extend the training corpus of GlossLM and pretrain PolyGloss, a family of seq2seq multilingual models for joint segmentation and glossing that outperforms GlossLM on glossing and beats various open-source LLMs on segmentation, glossing, and alignment. In addition, we demonstrate that PolyGloss can be quickly adapted to a new dataset via low-rank adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Selecting Language Models for Social Science: Start Small, Start Open, and Validate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10926</link><description>arXiv:2601.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, there are thousands of large pretrained language models (LLMs) available to social scientists. How do we select among them? Using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as guides, we explore the significance of: (1) model openness, (2) model footprint, (3) training data, and (4) model architectures and fine-tuning. While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post). Replicability, in particular, is a more pressing guide for selecting language models. Being able to reliably replicate a particular finding that entails the use of a language model necessitates reliably reproducing a task. To this end, we propose starting with smaller, open models, and constructing delimited benchmarks to demonstrate the validity of the entire computational pipeline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10926v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Secure Data Bridging in Industry 4.0: An OPC UA Aggregation Approach for Including Insecure Legacy Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10929</link><description>arXiv:2601.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased connectivity of industrial networks has led to a surge in cyberattacks, emphasizing the need for cybersecurity measures tailored to the specific requirements of industrial systems. Modern Industry 4.0 technologies, such as OPC UA, offer enhanced resilience against these threats. However, widespread adoption remains limited due to long installation times, proprietary technology, restricted flexibility, and formal process requirements (e.g. safety certifications). Consequently, many systems do not yet implement these technologies, or only partially. This leads to the challenge of dealing with so-called brownfield systems, which are often placed in isolated security zones to mitigate risks. However, the need for data exchange between secure and insecure zones persists.
  This paper reviews existing solutions to address this challenge by analysing their approaches, advantages, and limitations. Building on these insights, we identify three key concepts, evaluate their suitability and compatibility, and ultimately introduce the SigmaServer, a novel TCP-level aggregation method. The developed proof-of-principle implementation is evaluated in an operational technology (OT) testbed, demonstrating its applicability and effectiveness in bridging secure and insecure zones.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10929v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Where to Touch, How to Contact: Hierarchical RL-MPC Framework for Geometry-Aware Long-Horizon Dexterous Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10930</link><description>arXiv:2601.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in contact-rich dexterous manipulation is the need to jointly reason over geometry, kinematic constraints, and intricate, nonsmooth contact dynamics. End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. It achieves near-100% success with substantially reduced data (10x less than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10930v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse Data Tree Canopy Segmentation: Fine-Tuning Leading Pretrained Models on Only 150 Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10931</link><description>arXiv:2601.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10931v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tail-Aware Data Augmentation for Long-Tail Sequential Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10933</link><description>arXiv:2601.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) learns user preferences based on their historical interaction sequences and provides personalized suggestions. In real-world scenarios, most users can only interact with a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. This pervasive long-tail challenge limits the model's ability to learn user preferences. Despite previous efforts to enrich tail items/users with knowledge from head parts or improve tail learning through additional contextual information, they still face the following issues: 1) They struggle to improve the situation where interactions of tail users/items are scarce, leading to incomplete preferences learning for the tail parts. 2) Existing methods often degrade overall or head parts performance when improving accuracy for tail users/items, thereby harming the user experience. We propose Tail-Aware Data Augmentation (TADA) for long-tail sequential recommendation, which enhances the interaction frequency for tail items/users while maintaining head performance, thereby promoting the model's learning capabilities for the tail. Specifically, we first capture the co-occurrence and correlation among low-popularity items by a linear model. Building upon this, we design two tail-aware augmentation operators, T-Substitute and T-Insert. The former replaces the head item with a relevant item, while the latter utilizes co-occurrence relationships to extend the original sequence by incorporating both head and tail items. The augmented and original sequences are mixed at the representation level to preserve preference knowledge. We further extend the mix operation across different tail-user sequences and augmented sequences to generate richer augmented samples, thereby improving tail performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Exploratory searches are characterized by under-specified goals and evolving query intents. In such scenarios, retrieval models that can capture user-specified nuances in query intent and adapt results accordingly are desirable -- instruction-following retrieval models promise such a capability. In this work, we evaluate instructed retrievers for the prevalent yet under-explored application of aspect-conditional seed-guided exploration using an expert-annotated test collection. We evaluate both recent LLMs fine-tuned for instructed retrieval and general-purpose LLMs prompted for ranking with the highly performant Pairwise Ranking Prompting. We find that the best instructed retrievers improve on ranking relevance compared to instruction-agnostic approaches. However, we also find that instruction following performance, crucial to the user experience of interacting with models, does not mirror ranking relevance improvements and displays insensitivity or counter-intuitive behavior to instructions. Our results indicate that while users may benefit from using current instructed retrievers over instruction-agnostic models, they may not benefit from using them for long-running exploratory sessions requiring greater sensitivity to instructions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10936v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HOSL: Hybrid-Order Split Learning for Memory-Constrained Edge Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10940</link><description>arXiv:2601.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Change And Cover: Last-Mile, Pull Request-Based Regression Test Augmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10942</link><description>arXiv:2601.10942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software is in constant evolution, with developers frequently submitting pull requests (PRs) to introduce new features or fix bugs. Testing PRs is critical to maintaining software quality. Yet, even in projects with extensive test suites, some PR-modified lines remain untested, leaving a "last-mile" regression test gap. Existing test generators typically aim to improve overall coverage, but do not specifically target the uncovered lines in PRs. We present Change And Cover (ChaCo), an LLM-based test augmentation technique that addresses this gap. It makes three contributions: (i) ChaCo considers the PR-specific patch coverage, offering developers augmented tests for code just when it is on the developers' mind. (ii) We identify providing suitable test context as a crucial challenge for an LLM to generate useful tests, and present two techniques to extract relevant test content, such as existing test functions, fixtures, and data generators. (iii) To make augmented tests acceptable for developers, ChaCo carefully integrates them into the existing test suite, e.g., by matching the test's structure and style with the existing tests, and generates a summary of the test addition for developer review. We evaluate ChaCo on 145 PRs from three popular and complex open-source projects - SciPy, Qiskit, and Pandas. The approach successfully helps 30% of PRs achieve full patch coverage, at the cost of $0.11, showing its effectiveness and practicality. Human reviewers find the tests to be worth adding (4.53/5.0), well integrated (4.2/5.0), and relevant to the PR (4.7/5.0). Ablations show test context is crucial for context-aware test generation, leading to 2x coverage. We submitted 12 tests, of which 8 have already been merged, and two previously unknown bugs were exposed and fixed. We envision our approach to be integrated into CI workflows, automating the last mile of regression test augmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PRISM: Personalized Recommendation via Information Synergy Module</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10944</link><description>arXiv:2601.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal sequential recommendation (MSR) leverages diverse item modalities to improve recommendation accuracy, while achieving effective and adaptive fusion remains challenging. Existing MSR models often overlook synergistic information that emerges only through modality combinations. Moreover, they typically assume a fixed importance for different modality interactions across users. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{P}ersonalized \textbf{R}ecommend-ation via \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{S}ynergy \textbf{M}odule (PRISM), a plug-and-play framework for sequential recommendation (SR). PRISM explicitly decomposes multimodal information into unique, redundant, and synergistic components through an Interaction Expert Layer and dynamically weights them via an Adaptive Fusion Layer guided by user preferences. This information-theoretic design enables fine-grained disentanglement and personalized fusion of multimodal signals. Extensive experiments on four datasets and three SR backbones demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility.

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10945v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MMedExpert-R1: Strengthening Multimodal Medical Reasoning via Domain-Specific Adaptation and Clinical Guideline Reinforcement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10949</link><description>arXiv:2601.10949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10949v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing Framework for Realistic Clinical Interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10951</link><description>arXiv:2601.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of realistic clinical interactions plays a pivotal role in advancing clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) and supporting medical diagnostic education. Existing approaches and benchmarks rely on generic or LLM-generated dialogue data, which limits the authenticity and diversity of doctor-patient interactions. In this work, we propose the first Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim), constructed from realistic clinical interaction scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the performance of models in emulating patient behavior. Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification. We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing (MSPRP) framework, which decomposes interactions into three stages to ensure both personalization and realism in model responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves model performance across multiple dimensions of patient simulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10951v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SwiftKV: An Edge-Oriented Attention Algorithm and Multi-Head Accelerator for Fast, Efficient LLM Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10953</link><description>arXiv:2601.10953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge acceleration for large language models is crucial for their widespread application; however, achieving fast attention inference and efficient decoding on resource-constrained edge accelerators remains challenging. This paper presents SwiftKV Attention, a per-token pipelined, low-latency single-pass attention inference algorithm, where every (kt, vt) in the KV cache is processed exactly once in a uniform per-token pipeline without score materialization, blockwise softmax, or a second pass, thereby enabling fast execution on edge accelerators with a single hardware set and no resource-intensive parallelism. Furthermore, to address the limited support for multi-head LLM decoding in existing accelerators, we design the SwiftKV-MHA accelerator, which enables high precision attention and low precision GEMV on the same processor array, achieving fast and efficient multi-head parallel decoding. Experimental results show that, on the edge accelerator, the SwiftKV Attention algorithm achieves a 7.16* speedup over native attention and significantly outperforms other attention algorithms. SwiftKV-MHA further reduces attention latency by 13.48*; under the same settings, it improves generation speed by 17.4% and increases token efficiency by 1.98* compared with state-of-the-art works.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10953v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Max Tokens: Stealthy Resource Amplification via Tool Calling Chains in LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10955</link><description>arXiv:2601.10955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The agent-tool communication loop is a critical attack surface in modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from &lt;1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10955v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "I'm Constantly Getting Comments Like, 'Oh, You're Blind.

Abstract: Social media platforms are important venues for identity expression, and the Human-Computer Interaction community has been paying growing attention to how marginalized groups express their identities on these platforms. Joining the emerging literature on intersectional experiences, we study blind TikTokers ("BlindTokers") who are also women and/or LGBTQ+. Using interview data from \rev{41} participants, we identify their intersectional experiences as mediated by TikTok's socio-technical affordances. We argue that BlindTokers' intersectional marginalization is infrastructural: TikTok's classification and moderation features interact with social norms in ways that push them aside and distort how they are treated on the platform. We use this infrastructure perspective to understand what these experiences are, how they were formed, and how they become harmful. We further recognize participants' infrastructuring work to address these problems. This study guides future social media design with accessible creator tools, inclusive identity options, and context-aware moderation developed in partnership with communities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10957v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fundamental Limits of Quantum Semantic Communication via Sheaf Cohomology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10958</link><description>arXiv:2601.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) enables bandwidth-efficient coordination in multi-agent systems by transmitting meaning rather than raw bits. However, when agents employ heterogeneous sensing modalities and AI architectures, perfect bit-level transmission no longer guarantees mutual understanding. Although deep learning methods for semantic compression have advanced, the information-theoretic limits of semantic alignment under heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Notably, semantic ambiguity shares the same mathematical structure as quantum contextuality, as both arise from cohomological obstructions, motivating a quantum formulation of SC. In this paper, an information-theoretic framework for quantum semantic communication is proposed using sheaf cohomology. Multi-agent semantic networks are modeled as quantum sheaves, where agents meaning spaces are Hilbert spaces connected by quantum channels. The first sheaf cohomology group is shown to characterize irreducible semantic ambiguity, representing a fundamental obstruction to alignment that no local processing can resolve. The minimum communication rate required for semantic alignment is proven to scale with the logarithm of the dimension of the cohomological space, establishing a semantic analog of Shannon limits. For entanglement-assisted channels, the achievable capacity is shown to strictly exceed classical bounds, with each shared ebit reducing the required classical communication by one bit, providing a rigorous interpretation of shared context. Additionally, quantum contextuality is shown to reduce cohomological obstructions, and a duality between quantum discord and integrated semantic information is established, linking quantum correlations to irreducible semantic content. This framework provides rigorous foundations for quantum-enhanced semantic communication in autonomous multi-agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10958v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Steering Language Models Before They Speak: Logit-Level Interventions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10960</link><description>arXiv:2601.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering LLMs is essential for specialized applications such as style-sensitive text rewriting, user-adaptive communication, and toxicity mitigation. Current steering methods, such as prompting-based and activation-based approaches, are widely used to guide model behavior. However, activation-based techniques require deep access to internal layers, while prompting-based steering often fails to provide consistent or fine-grained control. In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10960v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multivariate LSTM-Based Forecasting for Renewable Energy: Enhancing Climate Change Mitigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10961</link><description>arXiv:2601.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into modern power systems presents significant opportunities but also notable challenges, primarily due to the inherent variability of RES generation. Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic methods and stochastic programming, frequently depend on representative scenarios generated through clustering techniques like K-means. However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy. In the case study, we showed that the proposed forecasting approach results in lower CO2 emissions, and a more reliable supply of electric loads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10961v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transient learning dynamics drive escape from sharp valleys in Stochastic Gradient Descent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10962</link><description>arXiv:2601.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is central to deep learning, yet the dynamical origin of its preference for flatter, more generalizable solutions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10962v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modeling Multi-Party Interaction in Couples Therapy: A Multi-Agent Simulation Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10970</link><description>arXiv:2601.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Couples therapy, or relationship counseling, helps partners resolve conflicts, improve satisfaction, and foster psychological growth.

We present a novel multimodal, multi-agent simulation system that models multi-party interactions in couples therapy.

In an evaluation study involving 21 US-based licensed therapists, participants blind to conditions identified the engineered agent behaviors (i.e., the stages and the demand-withdraw cycle) and rated overall realism and agent responses higher for the experimental system than the baseline. As the first known multi-agent framework for training couples therapists, our work builds the foundation for future research that fuses HCI technologies with couples therapy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AJAR: Adaptive Jailbreak Architecture for Red-teaming</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10971</link><description>arXiv:2601.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from static chatbots into autonomous agents capable of tool execution, the landscape of AI safety is shifting from content moderation to action security. However, existing red-teaming frameworks remain bifurcated: they either focus on rigid, script-based text attacks or lack the architectural modularity to simulate complex, multi-turn agentic exploitations. In this paper, we introduce AJAR (Adaptive Jailbreak Architecture for Red-teaming), a proof-of-concept framework designed to bridge this gap through Protocol-driven Cognitive Orchestration. Built upon the robust runtime of Petri, AJAR leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to decouple adversarial logic from the execution loop, encapsulating state-of-the-art algorithms like X-Teaming as standardized, plug-and-play services. We validate the architectural feasibility of AJAR through a controlled qualitative case study, demonstrating its ability to perform stateful backtracking within a tool-use environment. Furthermore, our preliminary exploration of the "Agentic Gap" reveals a complex safety dynamic: while tool usage introduces new injection vectors via code execution, the cognitive load of parameter formatting can inadvertently disrupt persona-based attacks. AJAR is open-sourced to facilitate the standardized, environment-aware evaluation of this emerging attack surface.

Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10973v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A monolithic fabrication platform for intrinsically stretchable polymer transistors and complementary circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10975</link><description>arXiv:2601.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft, stretchable organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) can provide powerful on-skin signal conditioning, but current fabrication methods are often material-specific: each new polymer semiconductor (PSC) requires a tailored process. The challenge is even greater for complementary OFET circuits, where two PSCs must be patterned sequentially, which often leads to device degradation. Here, we introduce a universal, monolithic photolithography process that enables high-yield, high-resolution stretchable complementary OFETs and circuits. This approach is enabled by a process-design framework that includes (i) a direct, photopatternable, solvent-resistant, crosslinked dielectric/semiconductor interface, (ii) broadly applicable crosslinked PSC blends that preserve high mobility, and (iii) a patterning strategy that provides simultaneous etch masking and encapsulation. Using this platform, we achieve record integration density for stretchable OTFTs (55,000 cm^-2), channel lengths down to 2 um, and low-voltage operation at 5 V. We demonstrate photopatterning across multiple PSC types and realize complementary circuits, including 3 kHz stretchable ring oscillators, the first to exceed 1 kHz and representing more than a 60-fold increase in stage switching speed over the state of the art. Finally, we demonstrate the first stretchable complementary OTFT neuron circuit, where the output frequency is modulated by the input current to mimic neuronal signal processing. This scalable approach can be readily extended to diverse high-performance stretchable materials, accelerating the development and manufacturing of skin-like electronics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10975v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Determining optimal thermal energy storage charging temperature for cooling using integrated building and coil modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10976</link><description>arXiv:2601.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) systems coupled with heat pumps offer significant potential for improving building energy efficiency by shifting electricity demand to off-peak hours. However, conventional operating strategies maintain conservatively low chilled water temperatures throughout the cooling season, a practice that results in suboptimal heat pump performance. This study proposes a physics-based integrated simulation framework to determine the maximum feasible chilled water supply temperature while ensuring cooling stability. The framework integrates four submodels: relative humidity prediction, dynamic cooling load estimation, cooling coil performance prediction, and TES discharge temperature prediction. Validation against measured data from an office building demonstrates reliable accuracy across all sub-models (e.g., CVRMSE of 9.3% for cooling load and R2 of 0.91 for peak-time discharge temperature). The integrated simulation reveals that the proposed framework can increase the daily initial TES charging temperature by an average of 2.55 {\deg}C compared to conventional fixed-temperature operation, enabling the heat pump to operate at a higher coefficient of performance. This study contributes a practical methodology for optimizing TES charging temperatures in building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems while maintaining indoor setpoint temperatures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10976v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Non-compact Positivity-Preserving Scheme for Parabolic PDE via Conditional Expectation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10977</link><description>arXiv:2601.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-compact, positivity-preserving scheme for linear non-divergence form parabolic equations. Based on the Feynman-Kac formula, the solution is expressed as a conditional expectation of an associated diffusion process. Instead of using compact Markov chain approximations, we employ a wide stencil scheme to approximate the conditional expectation, ensuring consistency and positivity preservation. This method is effective for anisotropic diffusion with mixed derivatives, where classical schemes often fail unless the covariance matrix is diagonally dominated.
  A key feature of our framework is its robust treatment of boundary conditions, which avoids the accuracy loss commonly encountered in BZ and semi-Lagrangian schemes. For Dirichlet boundaries, we introduce (i) a quad-tree non-uniform stopping time scheme with O($\Delta t^{1/2}$) accuracy and (ii) a quad-tree uniform stopping time scheme with O($\Delta t$) accuracy. For Neumann boundaries, we use discrete specular reflection with O($\Delta t^{1/2}$) convergence, while periodic boundaries are treated using modular wrapping, achieving O($\Delta t$) accuracy. All analyses are conducted under the practical scaling $\Delta t \sim h$.
  Except for the uniform stopping time scheme, all schemes are explicit. The schemes are unconditionally stable and positive preserving, thanks to the probabilistic structure. To ensure consistency, a non-compact stencil is involved, which leads to the large time step constraint $\Delta t \sim h$. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted $L^\infty$ convergence rates for all types of boundary conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10977v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating 21st-Century Competencies in Postsecondary Curricula with Large Language Models: Performance Benchmarking and Reasoning-Based Prompting Strategies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10983</link><description>arXiv:2601.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing emphasis on 21st-century competencies in postsecondary education, intensified by the transformative impact of generative AI, underscores the need to evaluate how these competencies are embedded in curricula and how effectively academic programs align with evolving workforce and societal demands. Curricular Analytics, particularly recent generative AI-powered approaches, offer a promising data-driven pathway. However, analyzing 21st-century competencies requires pedagogical reasoning beyond surface-level information retrieval, and the capabilities of large language models in this context remain underexplored. In this study, we extend prior curricular analytics research by examining a broader range of curriculum documents, competency frameworks, and models. Using 7,600 manually annotated curriculum-competency alignment scores, we assess the informativeness of different curriculum sources, benchmark general-purpose LLMs for curriculum-to-competency mapping, and analyze error patterns. We further introduce a reasoning-based prompting strategy, Curricular CoT, to strengthen LLMs' pedagogical reasoning. Our results show that detailed instructional activity descriptions are the most informative type of curriculum document for competency analytics. Open-weight LLMs achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary models on coarse-grained tasks, demonstrating their scalability and cost-effectiveness for institutional use. However, no model reaches human-level precision in fine-grained pedagogical reasoning. Our proposed Curricular CoT yields modest improvements by reducing bias in instructional keyword inference and improving the detection of nuanced pedagogical evidence in long text. Together, these findings highlight the untapped potential of institutional curriculum documents and provide an empirical foundation for advancing AI-driven curricular analytics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10983v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ZPD Detector: Data Selection via Capability-Difficulty Alignment for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10986</link><description>arXiv:2601.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the cost of training large language models continues to increase and high-quality training data become increasingly scarce, selecting high-value samples or synthesizing effective training data under limited data budgets has emerged as a critical research problem. Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design.

Abstract: We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10987v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Asymmetric Encoding-Decoding Schemes for Lossless Data Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10991</link><description>arXiv:2601.10991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new lossless data compression coding scheme named an asymmetric encoding-decoding scheme (AEDS), which can be considered as a generalization of tANS (tabled variant of asymmetric numeral systems). In the AEDS, a data sequence $\bm{s}=s_1s_2\cdots s_n$ is encoded in backward order $s_t, t=n, \cdots, 2,1$, while $\bm{s}$ is decoded in forward order $s_t, t=1, 2, \cdots, n$ in the same way as the tANS. But, the code class of the AEDS is much broader than that of the tANS. We show for i.i.d.~sources that an AEDS with 2 states (resp.~5 states) can attain a shorter average code length than the Huffman code if a child of the root in the Huffman code tree has a probability weight larger than 0.61803 (resp.~0.56984). Furthermore, we derive several upper bounds on the average code length of the AEDS, which also hold for the tANS, and we show that the average code length of the optimal AEDS and tANS with $N$ states converges to the source entropy with speed $O(1/N)$ as $N$ increases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constant Metric Scaling in Riemannian Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10992</link><description>arXiv:2601.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10992v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AFLL: Real-time Load Stabilization for MMO Game Servers Based on Circular Causality Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10998</link><description>arXiv:2601.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game servers must handle thousands of simultaneous players while maintaining sub-100ms response times. When server load exceeds capacity, traditional approaches either uniformly throttle all message types regardless of importance (damaging gameplay) or apply fixed heuristic rules that fail to adapt to dynamic workloads. This paper presents AFLL (Adaptive Feedback Loop Learning), a real-time load stabilization system that learns the causal relationship between outgoing server messages and subsequent incoming client requests. AFLL employs backpropagation to continuously adjust message type weights, enabling predictive throttling that blocks low-priority messages before overload occurs while guaranteeing critical message delivery. Through controlled experiments with 1,000 concurrent players, AFLL reduced average CPU time by 48.3% (13.2ms to 6.8ms), peak CPU time by 51.7% (54.0ms to 26.1ms), and thread contention by 64.4% (19.6% to 7.0%), while maintaining zero learning overhead through background computation and caching optimizations. The system achieved remarkable reproducibility (CV &lt; 2% across all metrics) and identified a three-stage causal chain linking message blocking to load reduction. AFLL demonstrates that circular causality learning enables practical real-time adaptation for latency-critical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10998v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Personalization Misleads: Understanding and Mitigating Hallucinations in Personalized LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11000</link><description>arXiv:2601.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) adapt model behavior to individual users to enhance user satisfaction, yet personalization can inadvertently distort factual reasoning. We show that when personalized LLMs face factual queries, there exists a phenomenon where the model generates answers aligned with a user's prior history rather than the objective truth, resulting in personalization-induced hallucinations that degrade factual reliability and may propagate incorrect beliefs, due to representational entanglement between personalization and factual representations. To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior. We further introduce PFQABench, the first benchmark designed to jointly evaluate factual and personalized question answering under personalization. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show that FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy while maintaining personalized performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Redefining Machine Simultaneous Interpretation: From Incremental Translation to Human-Like Strategies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11002</link><description>arXiv:2601.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations under strict real-time constraints, which traditional policies with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization and Pronominalization, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines. Notably, combining Drop and Sentence_Cut leads to consistent improvements in the balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NAACL: Noise-AwAre Verbal Confidence Calibration for LLMs in RAG Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11004</link><description>arXiv:2601.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately assessing model confidence is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in mission-critical factual domains. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11004v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Backdoor Attacks on Multi-modal Contrastive Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11006</link><description>arXiv:2601.11006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a leading self- supervised approach to representation learning across domains, including vision, multimodal settings, graphs, and federated learning. However, recent studies have shown that contrastive learning is susceptible to backdoor and data poisoning attacks. In these attacks, adversaries can manipulate pretraining data or model updates to insert hidden malicious behavior. This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions. Our findings have significant implications for the secure deployment of systems in industrial and distributed environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11006v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AdaMARP: An Adaptive Multi-Agent Interaction Framework for General Immersive Role-Playing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11007</link><description>arXiv:2601.11007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM role-playing aims to portray arbitrary characters in interactive narratives, yet existing systems often suffer from limited immersion and adaptability. They typically under-model dynamic environmental information and assume largely static scenes and casts, offering insufficient support for multi-character orchestration, scene transitions, and on-the-fly character introduction. We propose an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework, AdaMARP, featuring an immersive message format that interleaves [Thought], (Action), , and Speech, together with an explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) accompanied by rationales. To train these capabilities, we construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for supervising orchestration decisions, and introduce AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation. Experiments across multiple backbones and model scales demonstrate consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor outperforming several commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions, surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5 using only a 14B LLM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Protein Optimization via Structure-aware Hamiltonian Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11012</link><description>arXiv:2601.11012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to engineer optimized protein variants has transformative potential for biotechnology and medicine. Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/GENTEL-lab/HADES.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11012v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finding the Translation Switch: Discovering and Exploiting the Task-Initiation Features in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11019</link><description>arXiv:2601.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit strong translation abilities, even without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models. The codes are available at https://github.com/flamewei123/AAAI26-translation-Initiation-Features.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Interpretability to Performance: Optimizing Retrieval Heads for Long-Context Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11020</link><description>arXiv:2601.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in mechanistic interpretability have identified special attention heads, known as retrieval heads, that are responsible for retrieving information from the context. However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains. This mechanistic relationship validates the function of retrieval heads and demonstrates that mechanistic insights can be transformed into performance enhancements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Combating Spurious Correlations in Graph Interpretability via Self-Reflection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11021</link><description>arXiv:2601.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.
  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11021v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Matching High-Dimensional Geometric Quantiles for Test-Time Adaptation of Transformers and Convolutional Networks Alike</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11022</link><description>arXiv:2601.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting a classifier for the test data when the probability distribution of the test data slightly differs from that of the training data of the model. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing TTA approaches modify the weights of the classifier relying heavily on the architecture. It is unclear as to how these approaches are extendable to generic architectures. In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier. This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. We prove theoretically that under suitable conditions minimizing quantile loss can learn the optimal adapter. We validate our approach on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C by training both classic convolutional and transformer networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PruneRAG: Confidence-Guided Query Decomposition Trees for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11024</link><description>arXiv:2601.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a powerful framework for enhancing large language models in knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks. However, as reasoning chains deepen or search trees expand, RAG systems often face two persistent failures: evidence forgetting, where retrieved knowledge is not effectively used, and inefficiency, caused by uncontrolled query expansions and redundant retrieval. These issues reveal a critical gap between retrieval and evidence utilization in current RAG architectures. We propose PruneRAG, a confidence-guided query decomposition framework that builds a structured query decomposition tree to perform stable and efficient reasoning. PruneRAG introduces three key mechanisms: adaptive node expansion that regulates tree width and depth, confidence-guided decisions that accept reliable answers and prune uncertain branches, and fine-grained retrieval that extracts entity-level anchors to improve retrieval precision. Together, these components preserve salient evidence throughout multi-hop reasoning while significantly reducing retrieval overhead. To better analyze evidence misuse, we define the Evidence Forgetting Rate as a metric to quantify cases where golden evidence is retrieved but not correctly used. Extensive experiments across various multi-hop QA benchmarks show that PruneRAG achieves superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11024v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PEMNet: Towards Autonomous and Enhanced Environment-Aware Mobile Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11025</link><description>arXiv:2601.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With 5G deployment and the evolution toward 6G, mobile networks must make decisions in highly dynamic environments under strict latency, energy, and spectrum constraints. Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station's coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling. Compared with existing site-specific channel maps and digital-twin replicas, PEM distinctively emphasizes (i) joint channel-traffic embedding, which is essential for network optimization, and (ii) practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy while striking a favorable fidelity-cost balance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11025v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Crane Lowering Guidance Using a Attachable Camera Module for Driver Vision Support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11026</link><description>arXiv:2601.11026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cranes have long been essential equipment for lifting and placing heavy loads in construction projects. This study focuses on the lowering phase of crane operation, the stage in which the load is moved to the desired location. During this phase, a constant challenge exists: the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point. As a result, operators traditionally have to rely on verbal or gestural instructions from ground personnel, which significantly impacts site safety. To alleviate this constraint, the proposed system incorporates a attachable camera module designed to be attached directly to the load via a suction cup. This module houses a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. After installation, it streams and processes images of the ground directly below the load in real time to generate installation guidance. Simultaneously, this guidance is transmitted to and monitored by a host computer. Preliminary experiments were conducted by attaching this module to a test object, confirming the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission. This approach has the potential to significantly improve safety on construction sites by providing crane operators with an instant visual reference of hidden landing zones.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AVP-Pro: An Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion and Contrastive Learning Approach for Comprehensive Two-Stage Antiviral Peptide Identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11028</link><description>arXiv:2601.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is crucial for novel drug development. However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: High-dimensional portfolio optimization faces significant computational challenges under complex constraints, with traditional optimization methods struggling to balance convergence speed and global exploration capability. To address this, firstly, we introduce an enhanced Sharpe ratio-based model that incorporates all constraints into the objective function using adaptive penalty terms, transforming the original constrained problem into an unconstrained single-objective formulation. This approach preserves financial interpretability while simplifying algorithmic implementation. To efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem, we propose a Quantum Hybrid Differential Evolution (QHDE) algorithm, which integrates Quantum-inspired probabilistic behavior into the standard DE framework. QHDE employs a Schrodinger-inspired probabilistic mechanism for population evolution, enabling more flexible and diversified solution updates. To further enhance performance, a good point set-chaos reverse learning strategy is adopted to generate a well-dispersed initial population, and a dynamic elite pool combined with Cauchy-Gaussian hybrid perturbations strengthens global exploration and mitigates premature convergence. Experimental validation on CEC benchmarks and real-world portfolios involving 20 to 80 assets demonstrates that QHDE's performance improves by up to 73.4%. It attains faster convergence, higher solution precision, and greater robustness than seven state-of-the-art counterparts, thereby confirming its suitability for complex, high-dimensional portfolio optimization and advancing quantum-inspired evolutionary research in computational finance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11029v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IDDR-NGP: Incorporating Detectors for Distractor Removal with Instant Neural Radiance Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11030</link><description>arXiv:2601.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11030v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Your One-Stop Solution for AI-Generated Video Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11035</link><description>arXiv:2601.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in service computing and personalized recommendation. In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.
  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BAPO: Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization for Reliable Agentic Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11037</link><description>arXiv:2601.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RL-based agentic search enables LLMs to solve complex questions via dynamic planning and external search. While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Budget-Aware Anytime Reasoning with LLM-Synthesized Preference Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11038</link><description>arXiv:2601.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the reasoning behavior of large language models (LLMs) under limited computation budgets. In such settings, producing useful partial solutions quickly is often more practical than exhaustive reasoning, which incurs high inference costs. Many real-world tasks, such as trip planning, require models to deliver the best possible output within a fixed reasoning budget. We introduce an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index, a metric that quantifies how effectively solution quality improves as reasoning tokens increase. To further enhance efficiency, we propose an inference-time self-improvement method using LLM-synthesized preference data, where models learn from their own reasoning comparisons to produce better intermediate solutions. Experiments on NaturalPlan (Trip), AIME, and GPQA datasets show consistent gains across Grok-3, GPT-oss, GPT-4.1/4o, and LLaMA models, improving both reasoning quality and efficiency under budget constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11038v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SonicBench: Dissecting the Physical Perception Bottleneck in Large Audio Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11039</link><description>arXiv:2601.11039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) excel at semantic and paralinguistic tasks, yet their ability to perceive the fundamental physical attributes of audio such as pitch, loudness, and spatial location remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SonicBench, a psychophysically grounded benchmark that systematically evaluates 12 core physical attributes across five perceptual dimensions. Unlike previous datasets, SonicBench uses a controllable generation toolbox to construct stimuli for two complementary paradigms: recognition (absolute judgment) and comparison (relative judgment). This design allows us to probe not only sensory precision but also relational reasoning capabilities, a domain where humans typically exhibit greater proficiency. Our evaluation reveals a substantial deficiency in LALMs' foundational auditory understanding; most models perform near random guessing and, contrary to human patterns, fail to show the expected advantage on comparison tasks. Furthermore, explicit reasoning yields minimal gains. However, our linear probing analysis demonstrates crucially that frozen audio encoders do successfully capture these physical cues (accuracy at least 60%), suggesting that the primary bottleneck lies in the alignment and decoding stages, where models fail to leverage the sensory signals they have already captured.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11039v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] B-spline-Based ALE-MFS Framework for Evolving Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11041</link><description>arXiv:2601.11041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a B-spline based arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method of fundamental solutions (ALE-MFS) for curvature-driven motion of two-dimensional evolving domains. Boundary points move with the material to track the geometric flow, while interior points move within an ALE framework via a harmonic extension of the boundary velocity, computed by a meshless MFS with sources on a fixed auxiliary circle, thus avoiding volumetric meshing. Boundary normals and curvature are reconstructed by an adaptive local B-spline scheme that remains robust for strongly nonconvex shapes and large deformations. A posteriori error estimates are obtained from a hatmatrix formulation of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for both square collocation and zero-padded least-squares systems, and are complemented by maximum principle indicators for harmonic problems. Numerical experiments on circular, star-shaped, and amoeba-like domains show that square collocation suffices for moderately complex geometries, while zero-padded least-squares significantly improves interior velocity regularity and pointwise transport accuracy for strongly nonconvex shapes, without altering the source or collocation sets. The ALE-MFS algorithm also generates high-quality moving meshes for ALE-finite element methods, with larger minimum angles and slower mesh ratio growth than classical FEM mesh-motion strategies, suggesting a practical and easily integrable alternative for challenging moving-interface simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Characterization and Mitigation of Sequential Knowledge Editing Collapse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11042</link><description>arXiv:2601.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing in large language models often causes catastrophic collapse of the model's general abilities, especially for parameter-modifying methods. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Haptic Light-Emitting Diodes: Miniature, Luminous Tactile Actuators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11043</link><description>arXiv:2601.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Haptic Light-Emitting Diodes (HLEDs), luminous thermopneumatic actuators that directly convert pulsed light into mechanical forces and displacements. Each device packages a miniature surface-mount LED in a gas-filled cavity that contains a low-inertia graphite photoabsorber. The cavity is sealed by an elastic membrane, which functions as a working diaphragm. Brief optical pulses heat the photoabsorber, which heats the gas. The resulting rapid pressure increases generate forces and displacements at the working diaphragm. Millimeter-scale HLEDs produce forces exceeding 0.4 N and displacements of 1 mm at low voltages, with 5 to 100 ms response times, making them attractive as actuators providing tactile feedback in human-machine interfaces. Perceptual testing revealed that the strength of tactile feedback increased linearly with optical power. HLEDs devices are mechanically simple and efficient to fabricate. Unusually, these actuators are also light-emitting, as a fraction of optical energy is transmitted through the membrane. These opto-mechanical actuators have many potential applications in tactile displays, human interface engineering, wearable computing, and other areas.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11043v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgencyBench: Benchmarking the Frontiers of Autonomous Agents in 1M-Token Real-World Contexts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11044</link><description>arXiv:2601.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11044v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OpFML: Pipeline for ML-based Operational Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11046</link><description>arXiv:2601.11046v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities but often grapple with reliability challenges like hallucinations. While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that CoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] M3DDM+: An improved video outpainting by a modified masking strategy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11048</link><description>arXiv:2601.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We examine whether large language models (LLMs) can predict biased decision-making in conversational settings, and whether their predictions capture not only human cognitive biases but also how those effects change under cognitive load. In a pre-registered study (N = 1,648), participants completed six classic decision-making tasks via a chatbot with dialogues of varying complexity. Participants exhibited two well-documented cognitive biases: the Framing Effect and the Status Quo Bias. Increased dialogue complexity resulted in participants reporting higher mental demand. This increase in cognitive load selectively, but significantly, increased the effect of the biases, demonstrating the load-bias interaction. We then evaluated whether LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-5, and open-source models) could predict individual decisions given demographic information and prior dialogue. While results were mixed across choice problems, LLM predictions that incorporated dialogue context were significantly more accurate in several key scenarios. Importantly, their predictions reproduced the same bias patterns and load-bias interactions observed in humans. Across all models tested, the GPT-4 family consistently aligned with human behavior, outperforming GPT-5 and open-source models in both predictive accuracy and fidelity to human-like bias patterns. These findings advance our understanding of LLMs as tools for simulating human decision-making and inform the design of conversational agents that adapt to user biases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Adaptive Lagrangian B-Spline Framework for Point Cloud Manifold Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11051</link><description>arXiv:2601.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our recent curve-evolution framework based on localized B-spline interpolation to present an adaptive Lagrangian framework for the geometric evolution of point-cloud data representing smooth, codimension-one surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The method constructs overlapping, localized tensor-product B-spline patches, enabling direct, meshless surface evolution from discrete samples. Within each patch, the differentiable B-spline representation yields analytic, high-order estimates of intrinsic geometric invariants, supporting curvature-driven and geometry-coupled flows. The organization of control points facilitates coherent updates of both surface samples and spline coefficients under intrinsic velocity fields. A conditioning-aware formulation of the local interpolation system, combined with a Gauss-Seidel refinement of control points, maintains interpolation quality throughout the evolution. Adaptive knot insertion and point redistribution, guided by geometric error indicators and local sampling density, preserve surface resolution and regularity during deformation. Numerical experiments demonstrate efficient and accurate reproduction of surface evolution phenomena, including mean-curvature flow, anisotropic deformations, and coupled surface-field dynamics, establishing localized B-spline methods as precise and versatile tools for dynamic manifold approximation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11051v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RidgeWalker: Perfectly Pipelined Graph Random Walks on FPGAs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11057</link><description>arXiv:2601.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Random Walks (GRWs) offer efficient approximations of key graph properties and have been widely adopted in many applications. However, GRW workloads are notoriously difficult to accelerate due to their strong data dependencies, irregular memory access patterns, and imbalanced execution behavior. While recent work explores FPGA-based accelerators for GRWs, existing solutions fall far short of hardware potential due to inefficient pipelining and static scheduling. This paper presents RidgeWalker, a high-performance GRW accelerator designed for datacenter FPGAs. The key insight behind RidgeWalker is that the Markov property of GRWs allows decomposition into stateless, fine-grained tasks that can be executed out-of-order without compromising correctness. Building on this, RidgeWalker introduces an asynchronous pipeline architecture with a feedback-driven scheduler grounded in queuing theory, enabling perfect pipelining and adaptive load balancing. We prototype RidgeWalker on datacenter FPGAs and evaluated it across a range of GRW algorithms and real-world graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RidgeWalker achieves an average speedup of 7.0x over state-of-the-art FPGA solutions and 8.1x over GPU solutions, with peak speedups of up to 71.0x and 22.9x, respectively.

Abstract: We present our first stage results from deploying an LLM-augmented visualization software in a classroom setting to engage primary school children with earth-related datasets. Motivated by the growing interest in conversational AI as a means to support inquiry-based learning, we investigate children's expectations, engagement, and evaluation of a spoken LLM interface with a shared, immersive visualization system in a formal educational context. Our system integrates a speech-capable large language model with an interactive spherical display. It enables children to ask natural-language questions and receive coordinated verbal explanations and visual responses through the LLM-augmented visualization updating in real time based on spoken queries. We report on a classroom study with Swedish children aged 9-10, combining structured observation and small-group discussions to capture expectations prior to interaction, interaction patterns during facilitated sessions, and children's reflections on their encounter afterward. Our results provide empirical insights into children's initial encounters with an LLM-enabled visualization platform within a classroom setting and their expectations, interactions, and evaluations of the system.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is highly effective for enhancing LLM reasoning, yet recent evidence shows models like Qwen 2.5 achieve significant gains even with spurious or incorrect rewards. We investigate this phenomenon and identify a "Perplexity Paradox": spurious RLVR triggers a divergence where answer-token perplexity drops while prompt-side coherence degrades, suggesting the model is bypassing reasoning in favor of memorization. Using Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations, we uncover a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit that facilitates this shortcut. We localize a Functional Anchor in the middle layers (L18-20) that triggers the retrieval of memorized solutions, followed by Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) that transform representations to accommodate the shortcut signal. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling specific MLP keys within this circuit allows for bidirectional causal steering-artificially amplifying or suppressing contamination-driven performance. Our results provide a mechanistic roadmap for identifying and mitigating data contamination in RLVR-tuned models.

Abstract: In embodied artificial intelligence, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to execute long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions remains a critical challenge. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that H-AIM achieves a remarkable performance improvement, elevating the task success rate from 12% to 55% and boosting the goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the strongest baseline, LaMMA-P.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Cognitive Neuroscience and Graph Intelligence: Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph Learning for Web Finance Fraud</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11073</link><description>arXiv:2601.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11073v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A3D: Adaptive Affordance Assembly with Dual-Arm Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11076</link><description>arXiv:2601.11076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Furniture assembly is a crucial yet challenging task for robots, requiring precise dual-arm coordination where one arm manipulates parts while the other provides collaborative support and stabilization. To accomplish this task more effectively, robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process, while also generalizing across diverse part geometries. We propose A3D, a framework which learns adaptive affordances to identify optimal support and stabilization locations on furniture parts. The method employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns, enabling generalization across varied geometries. To handle evolving assembly states, we introduce an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions. We establish a simulation environment featuring 50 diverse parts across 8 furniture types, designed for dual-arm collaboration evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generalizes effectively to diverse part geometries and furniture categories in both simulation and real-world settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11076v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ABC-Bench: Benchmarking Agentic Backend Coding in Real-World Development</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11077</link><description>arXiv:2601.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has expanded the scope of AI coding from localized code generation to complex, repository-level, and execution-driven problem solving. However, current benchmarks predominantly evaluate code logic in static contexts, neglecting the dynamic, full-process requirements of real-world engineering, particularly in backend development which demands rigorous environment configuration and service deployment. To address this gap, we introduce ABC-Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate agentic backend coding within a realistic, executable workflow. Using a scalable automated pipeline, we curated 224 practical tasks spanning 8 languages and 19 frameworks from open-source repositories. Distinct from previous evaluations, ABC-Bench require the agents to manage the entire development lifecycle from repository exploration to instantiating containerized services and pass the external end-to-end API tests. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to deliver reliable performance on these holistic tasks, highlighting a substantial disparity between current model capabilities and the demands of practical backend engineering.

Abstract: Marker-based landing is widely used in drone delivery and return-to-base systems for its simplicity and reliability. However, most approaches assume idealized landing site visibility and sensor performance, limiting robustness in complex urban settings. We present a simulation-based evaluation suite on the AirSim platform with systematically varied urban layouts, lighting, and weather to replicate realistic operational diversity. Using onboard camera sensors (RGB for marker detection and depth for obstacle avoidance), we benchmark two heuristic coverage patterns and a reinforcement learning-based agent, analyzing how exploration strategy and scene complexity affect success rate, path efficiency, and robustness. Results underscore the need to evaluate marker-based autonomous landing under diverse, sensor-relevant conditions to guide the development of reliable aerial navigation systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11078v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Soft Bayesian Context Tree Models for Real-Valued Time Series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11079</link><description>arXiv:2601.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the soft Bayesian context tree model (Soft-BCT), which is a novel BCT model for real-valued time series. The Soft-BCT considers soft (probabilistic) splits of the context space, instead of hard (deterministic) splits of the context space as in the previous BCT for real-valued time series.

For some real-world datasets, the Soft-BCT demonstrates almost the same or superior performance to the previous BCT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11079v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PhysRVG: Physics-Aware Unified Reinforcement Learning for Video Generative Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11087</link><description>arXiv:2601.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11087v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MiCA: A Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter for Lightweight Epidemic Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11089</link><description>arXiv:2601.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Multilingual Name Type Classification Using Convolutional Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11090</link><description>arXiv:2601.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a convolutional neural network approach for classifying proper names by language and entity type.

We evaluate the architecture on a large multilingual dataset covering 104 languages and four entity types (person, organization, location, other). Onomas-CNN X achieves 92.1% accuracy while processing 2,813 names per second on a single CPU core - 46 times faster than fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa with comparable accuracy. The model reduces energy consumption by a factor of 46 compared to transformer baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that specialized CNN architectures remain competitive with large pre-trained models for focused NLP tasks when sufficient training data exists.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11090v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Integrity Shield A System for Ethical AI Use &amp; Authorship Transparency in Assessments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11093</link><description>arXiv:2601.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can now solve entire exams directly from uploaded PDF assessments, raising urgent concerns about academic integrity and the reliability of grades and credentials. Existing watermarking techniques either operate at the token level or assume control over the model's decoding process, making them ineffective when students query proprietary black-box systems with instructor-provided documents. We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged. These watermarks consistently prevent MLLMs from answering shielded exam PDFs and encode stable, item-level signatures that can be reliably recovered from model or student responses. Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance &amp; authorship evidence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11093v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Quantum-Resistant Trusted Computing: Architectures for Post-Quantum Integrity Verification Techniques</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11095</link><description>arXiv:2601.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust is the core building block of secure systems, and it is enforced through methods to ensure that a specific system is properly configured and works as expected. In this context, a Root of Trust (RoT) establishes a trusted environment, where both data and code are authenticated via a digital signature based on asymmetric cryptography, which is vulnerable to the threat posed by Quantum Computers (QCs). Firmware, being the first layer of trusted software, faces unique risks due to its longevity and difficult update. The transition of firmware protection to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is urgent, since it reduces the risk derived from exposing all computing and network devices to quantum-based attacks. This paper offers an analysis of the most common trust techniques and their roadmap towards a Post-Quantum (PQ) world, by investigating the current status of PQC and the challenges posed by such algorithms in existing Trusted Computing (TC) solutions from an integration perspective. Furthermore, this paper proposes an architecture for TC techniques enhanced with PEC, addressing the imperative for immediate adoption of quantum-resistant algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11095v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoDance: An Unbind-Rebind Paradigm for Robust Multi-Subject Animation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11096</link><description>arXiv:2601.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReCreate: Reasoning and Creating Domain Agents Driven by Experience</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11100</link><description>arXiv:2601.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model agents are reshaping the industrial landscape. However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11100v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph Smoothing for Enhanced Local Geometry Learning in Point Cloud Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11102</link><description>arXiv:2601.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11102v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Twin: Enhancing ESL Speaking Practice through AI Self-Clones of a Better Me</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11103</link><description>arXiv:2601.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in AI have enabled ESL learners to practice speaking through conversational systems. However, most tools rely on explicit correction, which can interrupt the conversation and undermine confidence. Grounded in second language acquisition and motivational psychology, we present AI Twin, a system that rephrases learner utterances into more fluent English and delivers them in the learner's voice. Embodying a more confident and proficient version of the learner, AI Twin reinforces motivation through alignment with their aspirational Ideal L2 Self. Also, its use of implicit feedback through rephrasing preserves conversational flow and fosters an emotionally supportive environment. In a within-subject study with 20 adult ESL learners, we compared AI Twin with explicit correction and a non-personalized rephrasing agent. Results show that AI Twin elicited higher emotional engagement, with participants describing the experience as more motivating. These findings highlight the potential of self-representative AI for personalized, psychologically grounded support in ESL learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision-as-Inverse-Graphics Agent via Interleaved Multimodal Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11109</link><description>arXiv:2601.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differentially Private Subspace Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11113</link><description>arXiv:2601.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on downstream tasks is crucial for realizing their cross-domain potential but often relies on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11113v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparing User Time with a Socially-Aware Independent Metaverse Avatar</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11115</link><description>arXiv:2601.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Metaverse is redefining digital interactions by merging physical, virtual, and social dimensions, yet its effects on social networking remain largely unexplored. This work examines the role of independent avatars (autonomous digital entities capable of managing social interactions on behalf of users), to optimize social time allocation and reshape Metaverse-based Online Social Networks. We propose a novel computational model that integrates a quantitative and realistic representation of user social life, grounded in evolutionary anthropology, with a framework for avatar-mediated interactions. Our model quantifies the effectiveness of a partial replacement of in-person interactions with independent avatar interactions. Additionally, it accounts for social conflicts and specific socialization constraints. We leverage our model to explore the benefits and trade-offs of an avatar-augmented social life in the Metaverse. Since the exact problem formulation leads to an NP-hard optimization problem when incorporating avatars into the social network, we tackle this challenge by introducing a heuristic solution. Through simulations, we compare avatar-mediated and non-avatar-mediated social networking, demonstrating the potential of independent avatars to enhance social connectivity and efficiency. Our findings provide a foundation for optimizing Metaverse-based social interactions, as well as useful insights for future digital social network design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11115v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimized Algorithms for Text Clustering with LLM-Generated Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11118</link><description>arXiv:2601.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool that has garnered significant interest across a wide range of applications including text analysis. To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11118v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learn Before Represent: Bridging Generative and Contrastive Learning for Domain-Specific LLM Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11124</link><description>arXiv:2601.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) adapted via contrastive learning excel in general representation learning but struggle in vertical domains like chemistry and law, primarily due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge. This work identifies a core bottleneck: the prevailing ``LLM+CL'' paradigm focuses on semantic alignment but cannot perform knowledge acquisition, leading to failures on specialized terminology. To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building accurate and robust representations in vertical domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Big Ban Theory: A Pre- and Post-Intervention Dataset of Online Content Moderation Actions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11128</link><description>arXiv:2601.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online platforms rely on moderation interventions to curb harmful behavior such hate speech, toxicity, and the spread of mis- and disinformation. Yet research on the effects and possible biases of such interventions faces multiple limitations. For example, existing works frequently focus on single or a few interventions, due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. As a result, researchers must typically collect the necessary data for each new study, which limits opportunities for systematic comparisons. To overcome these challenges, we introduce The Big Ban Theory (TBBT), a large dataset of moderation interventions. TBBT covers 25 interventions of varying type, severity, and scope, comprising in total over 339K users and nearly 39M posted messages. For each intervention, we provide standardized metadata and pseudonymized user activity collected three months before and after its enforcement, enabling consistent and comparable analyses of intervention effects. In addition, we provide a descriptive exploratory analysis of the dataset, along with several use cases of how it can support research on content moderation. With this dataset, we aim to support researchers studying the effects of moderation interventions and to promote more systematic, reproducible, and comparable research.

Abstract: Considering the increasing frequency of cyberattacks affecting multiple hospitals simultaneously, improving resilience at a network level is essential. Various countermeasures exist to improve resilience against cyberattacks, such as deploying controls that strengthen IT infrastructures to limit their impact, or enabling resource sharing, patient transfers and backup capacities to maintain services of hospitals in response to realized attacks. However, determining the most cost-effective combination among these wide range of countermeasures is a complex challenge, further intensified by constrained budgets and competing priorities between maintaining efficient daily hospital operations and investing in disaster preparedness. To address these challenges, we propose a defender-attacker-defender optimization model that supports decision-makers in identifying effective strategies for improving the resilience of a network of hospitals against cyberattacks. The model explicitly captures interdependence between hospital services and their supporting IT infrastructures. By doing so, cyberattacks can be directly translated into reductions of service capacities, which allows to assess proactive and reactive strategies on both the operational and technical sides within a single framework. Further, time-dependent resilience measures are incorporated as design objectives to account for the mid- to long-term consequences of cyberattacks. The model is validated based on the German hospital network, suggesting that enabling cooperation with backup capacities particularly in urban areas, alongside strengthening of IT infrastructures across all hospitals, are crucial strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11129v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FSL-BDP: Federated Survival Learning with Bayesian Differential Privacy for Credit Risk Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11134</link><description>arXiv:2601.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context-aware Graph Causality Inference for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11135</link><description>arXiv:2601.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Patterns of Bot Participation and Emotional Influence in Open-Source Development</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11138</link><description>arXiv:2601.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how bots contribute to open-source discussions in the Ethereum ecosystem and whether they influence developers' emotional tone. Our dataset covers 36,875 accounts across ten repositories with 105 validated bots (0.28%). Human participation follows a U-shaped pattern, while bots engage in uniform (pull requests) or late-stage (issues) activity. Bots respond faster than humans in pull requests but play slower maintenance roles in issues. Using a model trained on 27 emotion categories, we find bots are more neutral, yet their interventions are followed by reduced neutrality in human comments, with shifts toward gratitude, admiration, and optimism and away from confusion. These findings indicate that even a small number of bots are associated with changes in both timing and emotional dynamics of developer communication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11138v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When "Likers'' Go Private: Engagement With Reputationally Risky Content on X</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11140</link><description>arXiv:2601.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In June 2024, X/Twitter changed likes' visibility from public to private, offering a rare, platform-level opportunity to study how the visibility of engagement signals affects users' behavior. Here, we investigate whether hiding liker identities increases the number of likes received by high-reputational-risk content, content for which public endorsement may carry high social or reputational costs due to its topic (e.g., politics) or the account context in which it appears (e.g., partisan accounts). To this end, we conduct two complementary studies: 1) a Difference-in-Differences analysis of engagement with 154,122 posts by 1068 accounts before and after the policy change. 2) a within-subject survey experiment with 203 X users on participants' self-reported willingness to like different kinds of content. We find no detectable platform-level increase in likes for high-reputational-risk content (Study 1). This finding is robust for both between-group comparison of high- versus low-reputational-risk accounts and within-group comparison across engagement types (i.e., likes vs. reposts). Additionally, while participants in the survey experiment report modest increases in willingness to like high-reputational-risk content under private versus public visibility, these increases do not lead to significant changes in the group-level average likelihood of liking posts (Study 2). Taken together, our results suggest that hiding likes produces a limited behavioral response at the platform level. This may be caused by a gap between user intention and behavior, or by engagement driven by a narrow set of high-usage or automated accounts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11140v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlashLabs Chroma 1.0: A Real-Time End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Model with Personalized Voice Cloning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11141</link><description>arXiv:2601.11141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent end-to-end spoken dialogue systems leverage speech tokenizers and neural audio codecs to enable LLMs to operate directly on discrete speech representations. However, these models often exhibit limited speaker identity preservation, hindering personalized voice interaction. In this work, we present Chroma 1.0, the first open-source, real-time, end-to-end spoken dialogue model that achieves both low-latency interaction and high-fidelity personalized voice cloning. Chroma achieves sub-second end-to-end latency through an interleaved text-audio token schedule (1:2) that supports streaming generation, while maintaining high-quality personalized voice synthesis across multi-turn conversations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Chroma achieves a 10.96% relative improvement in speaker similarity over the human baseline, with a Real-Time Factor (RTF) of 0.43, while maintaining strong reasoning and dialogue capabilities.

Abstract: The simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer of large-scale hydraulic robots presents a significant challenge in robotics because of the inherent slow control response and complex fluid dynamics. The complex dynamics result from the multiple interconnected cylinder structure and the difference in fluid rates of the cylinders. These characteristics complicate detailed simulation for all joints, making it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent the complicated actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, allowing rapid processing in RL environments. We compare our model with neural network-based actuator models and demonstrate the advantages of our model in data-limited scenarios. The locomotion policy trained in RL with our model is deployed on a hydraulic quadruped robot, which is over 300 kg. This work is the first demonstration of a successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11143v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep GraphRAG: A Balanced Approach to Hierarchical Retrieval and Adaptive Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11144</link><description>arXiv:2601.11144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) frameworks face a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of global search and the efficiency of local search. Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11144v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do We Always Need Query-Level Workflows?

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on large language models typically solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents through workflows. Existing approaches generates workflows either at task level or query level, but their relative costs and benefits remain unclear. After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \textbf{SCALE}, which means \underline{\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \underline{\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \underline{\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11147v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Modal Attention Network with Dual Graph Learning in Multimodal Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11151</link><description>arXiv:2601.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimedia recommendation systems leverage user-item interactions and multimodal information to capture user preferences, enabling more accurate and personalized recommendations. Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency. Theoretical and empirical analyses confirm its scalability and high practical efficiency, achieving faster convergence on small datasets and superior performance ceilings on large-scale ones. Comprehensive experiments on four public real-world datasets validate an average 5% improvement in key metrics over state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An efficient solver based on low-rank approximation and Neumann matrix series for unsteady diffusion-type partial differential equations with random coefficients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11152</link><description>arXiv:2601.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an efficient numerical solver for unsteady diffusion-type partial differential equations with random coefficients. A major computational challenge in such problems lies in repeatedly handling large-scale linear systems arising from spatial and temporal discretizations under uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose a novel generalized low-rank matrix approximation to represent the stochastic stiffness matrices, and approximate their inverses using the Neumann matrix series expansion. This approach transforms high-dimensional matrix inversion into a sequence of low-dimensional matrix multiplications. Therefore, the solver significantly reduces the computational cost and storage requirements while maintaining high numerical accuracy. The error analysis of the proposed solver is also provided. Finally, we apply the method to two classic uncertainty quantification problems: unsteady stochastic diffusion equations and the associated distributed optimal control problems. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solver.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11152v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Non-uniformly Stable Common Independent Sets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11153</link><description>arXiv:2601.11153v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Unplanned engine failures in helicopters can lead to severe operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs. To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11154v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Randomized Extended Bregman-Kaczmarz Method for Combined Optimization Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11157</link><description>arXiv:2601.11157v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $\kappa$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $\kappa$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa} m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrt{\kappa}$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(\kappa^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $\kappa^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11159v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Clustering High-dimensional Data: Balancing Abstraction and Representation Tutorial at AAAI 2026</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11160</link><description>arXiv:2601.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.
  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.
  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11160v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GMM-COMET: Continual Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation via a Mean Teacher and Gaussian Mixture Model-Based Pseudo-Labeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11161</link><description>arXiv:2601.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Abstract: Standard softmax self-attention excels in vision tasks but incurs quadratic complexity O(N^2), limiting high-resolution deployment. Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Crawling national top-level domains has proven to be highly effective for collecting texts in less-resourced languages. This approach has been recently used for South Slavic languages and resulted in the largest general corpora for this language group: the CLASSLA-web 1.0 corpora. Building on this success, we established a continuous crawling infrastructure for iterative national top-level domain crawling across South Slavic and related webs. We present the first outcome of this crawling infrastructure - the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus collection, with substantially larger web corpora containing 17.0 billion words in 38.1 million texts in seven languages: Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian, and Slovenian. In addition to genre categories, the new version is also automatically annotated with topic labels. Comparing CLASSLA-web 2.0 with its predecessor reveals that only one-fifth of the texts overlap, showing that re-crawling after just two years yields largely new content. However, while the new web crawls bring growing gains, we also notice growing pains - a manual inspection of top domains reveals a visible degradation of web content, as machine-generated sites now contribute a significant portion of texts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Proving Circuit Functional Equivalence in Zero Knowledge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11173</link><description>arXiv:2601.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern integrated circuit ecosystem is increasingly reliant on third-party intellectual property integration, which introduces security risks, including hardware Trojans and security vulnerabilities. Addressing the resulting trust deadlock between IP vendors and system integrators without exposing proprietary designs requires novel privacy-preserving verification techniques. However, existing privacy-preserving hardware verification methods are all simulation-based and fail to offer formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose ZK-CEC, the first privacy-preserving framework for hardware formal verification. By combining formal verification and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), ZK-CEC establishes a foundation for formally verifying IP correctness and security without compromising the confidentiality of the designs.
  We observe that existing zero-knowledge protocols for formal verification are designed to prove statements of public formulas. However, in a privacy-preserving verification context where the formula is secret, these protocols cannot prevent a malicious prover from forging the formula, thereby compromising the soundness of the verification. To address these gaps, we first propose a blueprint for proving the unsatisfiability of a secret design against a public constraint, which is widely applicable to proving properties in software, hardware, and cyber-physical systems. Based on the proposed blueprint, we construct ZK-CEC, which enables a prover to convince the verifier that a secret IP's functionality aligns perfectly with the public specification in zero knowledge, revealing only the length and width of the proof. We implement ZK-CEC and evaluate its performance across various circuits, including arithmetic units and cryptographic components. Experimental results show that ZK-CEC successfully verifies practical designs, such as the AES S-Box, within practical time limits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11173v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TANDEM: Temporal-Aware Neural Detection for Multimodal Hate Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11178</link><description>arXiv:2601.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11178v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Knots to Knobs: Towards Steerable Collaborative Filtering Using Sparse Autoencoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11182</link><description>arXiv:2601.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as pivotal tools for introspection into large language models. SAEs can uncover high-quality, interpretable features at different levels of granularity and enable targeted steering of the generation process by selectively activating specific neurons in their latent activations. Our paper is the first to apply this approach to collaborative filtering, aiming to extract similarly interpretable features from representations learned purely from interaction signals. In particular, we focus on a widely adopted class of collaborative autoencoders (CFAEs) and augment them by inserting an SAE between their encoder and decoder networks. We demonstrate that such representation is largely monosemantic and propose suitable mapping functions between semantic concepts and individual neurons. We also evaluate a simple yet effective method that utilizes this representation to steer the recommendations in a desired direction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11182v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Democratizing planetary-scale analysis: An ultra-lightweight Earth embedding database for accurate and flexible global land monitoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11183</link><description>arXiv:2601.11183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11183v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TimeMar: Multi-Scale Autoregressive Modeling for Unconditional Time Series Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11184</link><description>arXiv:2601.11184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling offers a promising solution to data scarcity and privacy challenges in time series analysis. However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TimeMAR-BC5B.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11184v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Policy-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning Hyperheuristics for Job-Shop Scheduling Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11189</link><description>arXiv:2601.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a policy-based deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic framework for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. The hyper-heuristic agent learns to switch scheduling rules based on the system state dynamically. We extend the hyper-heuristic framework with two key mechanisms. First, action prefiltering restricts decision-making to feasible low-level actions, enabling low-level heuristics to be evaluated independently of environmental constraints and providing an unbiased assessment. Second, a commitment mechanism regulates the frequency of heuristic switching. We investigate the impact of different commitment strategies, from step-wise switching to full-episode commitment, on both training behavior and makespan. Additionally, we compare two action selection strategies at the policy level: deterministic greedy selection and stochastic sampling. Computational experiments on standard JSSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11189v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DOREMI: Optimizing Long Tail Predictions in Document-Level Relation Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11190</link><description>arXiv:2601.11190v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Recent advances in reservoir simulation increasingly utilize hybrid approaches that couple physics-based simulators with machine-learning (ML) components. ML components offer high fidelity to training data and fast inference, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of complex multi-scale or multi-physics phenomena. Modern reservoir simulators rely on automatic differentiation (AD) to support efficient and flexible strategies for nonlinear solvers, inverse problems, and optimization problems. Efficient hybrid modeling therefore requires tight integration of the ML components with the simulator's AD framework.
  We present the first integration of neural networks into the high-performance reservoir simulator OPM Flow. Networks are trained in TensorFlow and imported into OPM, where they are accessed as native AD functions. This presents an efficient framework for hybrid modeling and enables seamless integration in existing simulator workflows.
  As an application, we introduce a novel, data-driven near-well model. Near-well models are essential in reservoir simulation for accurately representing singular pressure gradients around wells. Commonly used are the Peaceman near-well model and its extensions, or local grid refinement around the wells. Peaceman-type models are limited to simplified flow regimes, whereas local grid refinement is computationally expensive. We address these limitations by training a neural network to infer a Peaceman-like well index from fine-scale ensemble simulations of the near-well region. It is then integrated into OPM Flow with the new framework. Tested on relevant examples for CO$_2$ storage, the method offers high fidelity to fine-scale results at low computational cost, demonstrating the potential of the OPM Flow-Neural Network framework for hybrid modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11193v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ATATA: One Algorithm to Align Them All</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11194</link><description>arXiv:2601.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SD-RAG: A Prompt-Injection-Resilient Framework for Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11199</link><description>arXiv:2601.11199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has attracted significant attention due to its ability to combine the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge obtained through efficient retrieval mechanisms over large-scale data collections. Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11199v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FAQ: Mitigating Quantization Error via Regenerating Calibration Data with Family-Aware Quantization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11200</link><description>arXiv:2601.11200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an efficient numerical compression scheme for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices, the representativeness and universality of calibration data remain a core bottleneck in determining the accuracy of quantization parameters. Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Epistemic Control and the Normativity of Machine Learning-Based Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11202</link><description>arXiv:2601.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past few years have witnessed an increasing use of machine learning (ML) systems in science. Paul Humphreys has argued that, because of specific characteristics of ML systems, human scientists are pushed out of the loop of science. In this chapter, I investigate to what extent this is true. First, I express these concerns in terms of what I call epistemic control. I identify two conditions for epistemic control, called tracking and tracing, drawing on works in philosophy of technology. With this new understanding of the problem, I then argue against Humphreys pessimistic view. Finally, I construct a more nuanced view of epistemic control in ML-based science.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Solution Concepts and Existence Results for Hybrid Systems with Continuous-time Inputs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11205</link><description>arXiv:2601.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many scenarios, it is natural to model a plant's dynamical behavior using a hybrid dynamical system influenced by exogenous continuous-time inputs. While solution concepts and analytical tools for existence and completeness are well established for autonomous hybrid systems, corresponding results for hybrid dynamical systems involving continuous-time inputs are generally lacking. This work aims to address this gap. We first formalize notions of a solution for such systems. We then provide conditions that guarantee the existence and forward completeness of solutions. Moreover, we leverage results and ideas from viability theory to present more explicit conditions in terms of various tangent cone formulations.

Abstract: Backdoored and privacy-leaking deep neural networks pose a serious threat to the deployment of machine learning systems in security-critical settings. Existing defenses for backdoor detection and membership inference typically require access to clean reference models, extensive retraining, or strong assumptions about the attack mechanism. In this work, we introduce a novel LoRA-based oracle framework that leverages low-rank adaptation modules as a lightweight, model-agnostic probe for both backdoor detection and membership inference.
  Our approach attaches task-specific LoRA adapters to a frozen backbone and analyzes their optimization dynamics and representation shifts when exposed to suspicious samples. We show that poisoned and member samples induce distinctive low-rank updates that differ significantly from those generated by clean or non-member data. These signals can be measured using simple ranking and energy-based statistics, enabling reliable inference without access to the original training data or modification of the deployed model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VidLeaks: Membership Inference Attacks Against Text-to-Video Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11210</link><description>arXiv:2601.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of powerful Text-to-Video (T2V) models, trained on massive web-scale datasets, raises urgent concerns about copyright and privacy violations. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled tool for auditing such risks, yet existing techniques - designed for static data like images or text - fail to capture the spatio-temporal complexities of video generation. In particular, they overlook the sparsity of memorization signals in keyframes and the instability introduced by stochastic temporal dynamics. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of MIAs against T2V models and introduce a novel framework VidLeaks, which probes sparse-temporal memorization through two complementary signals: 1) Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF), using a Top-K similarity to amplify spatial memorization signals from sparsely memorized keyframes, and 2) Temporal Generative Stability (TGS), which measures semantic consistency across multiple queries to capture temporal leakage. We evaluate VidLeaks under three progressively restrictive black-box settings - supervised, reference-based, and query-only. Experiments on three representative T2V models reveal severe vulnerabilities: VidLeaks achieves AUC of 82.92% on AnimateDiff and 97.01% on InstructVideo even in the strict query-only setting, posing a realistic and exploitable privacy risk. Our work provides the first concrete evidence that T2V models leak substantial membership information through both sparse and temporal memorization, establishing a foundation for auditing video generation systems and motivating the development of new defenses.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention as a way to enable privacy-preserving adaptation over distributed data. Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MultiCaption: Detecting disinformation using multilingual visual claims</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11220</link><description>arXiv:2601.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online disinformation poses an escalating threat to society, driven increasingly by the rapid spread of misleading content across both multimedia and multilingual platforms. While automated fact-checking methods have advanced in recent years, their effectiveness remains constrained by the scarcity of datasets that reflect these real-world complexities. To address this gap, we first present MultiCaption, a new dataset specifically designed for detecting contradictions in visual claims. Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments. We then provide comprehensive experiments using transformer-based architectures, natural language inference models, and large language models, establishing strong baselines for future research. The results show that MultiCaption is more challenging than standard NLI tasks, requiring task-specific finetuning for strong performance. Moreover, the gains from multilingual training and testing highlight the dataset's potential for building effective multilingual fact-checking pipelines without relying on machine translation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Operator learning on domain boundary through combining fundamental solution-based artificial data and boundary integral techniques</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11222</link><description>arXiv:2601.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For linear partial differential equations with known fundamental solutions, this work introduces a novel operator learning framework that relies exclusively on domain boundary data, including solution values and normal derivatives, rather than full-domain sampling. By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time. The framework is naturally extensible to three-dimensional problems and complex geometries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11222v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language of Thought Shapes Output Diversity in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11227</link><description>arXiv:2601.11227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Output diversity is crucial for Large Language Models as it underpins pluralism and creativity. In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective for data augmentation in classification tasks like intent detection. In some cases, they inadvertently produce examples that are ambiguous with regard to untargeted classes. We present DDAIR (Disambiguated Data Augmentation for Intent Recognition) to mitigate this problem. We use Sentence Transformers to detect ambiguous class-guided augmented examples generated by LLMs for intent recognition in low-resource scenarios. We identify synthetic examples that are semantically more similar to another intent than to their target one. We also provide an iterative re-generation method to mitigate such ambiguities. Our findings show that sentence embeddings effectively help to (re)generate less ambiguous examples, and suggest promising potential to improve classification performance in scenarios where intents are loosely or broadly defined.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11234v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bio-inspired fine-tuning for selective transfer learning in image classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11235</link><description>arXiv:2601.11235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced image analysis across diverse domains but often depends on large, annotated datasets for success. Transfer learning addresses this challenge by utilizing pre-trained models to tackle new tasks with limited labeled data. However, discrepancies between source and target domains can hinder effective transfer learning. We introduce BioTune, a novel adaptive fine-tuning technique utilizing evolutionary optimization. BioTune enhances transfer learning by optimally choosing which layers to freeze and adjusting learning rates for unfrozen layers. Through extensive evaluation on nine image classification datasets, spanning natural and specialized domains such as medical imaging, BioTune demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods, including AutoRGN and LoRA, highlighting its adaptability to various data characteristics and distribution changes. Additionally, BioTune consistently achieves top performance across four different CNN architectures, underscoring its flexibility. Ablation studies provide valuable insights into the impact of BioTune's key components on overall performance.

Abstract: Query expansion is a long-standing technique to mitigate vocabulary mismatch in ad hoc Information Retrieval. Pseudo-relevance feedback methods, such as RM3, estimate an expanded query model from the top-ranked documents, but remain vulnerable to topic drift when early results include noisy or tangential content. Recent approaches instead prompt Large Language Models to generate synthetic expansions or query variants. While effective, these methods risk hallucinations and misalignment with collection-specific terminology. We propose a hybrid alternative that preserves the robustness and interpretability of classical PRF while leveraging LLM semantic judgement. Our method inserts an LLM-based filtering stage prior to RM3 estimation: the LLM judges the documents in the initial top-$k$ ranking, and RM3 is computed only over those accepted as relevant. This simple intervention improves over blind PRF and a strong baseline across several datasets and metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Image-Text Knowledge Modeling for Unsupervised Multi-Scenario Person Re-Identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11243</link><description>arXiv:2601.11243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11243v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analysis of Full Order Observer Based Control for Spacecraft Orbit Maneuver Trajectory Under Solar Radiation Pressure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11244</link><description>arXiv:2601.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of modern control theory to improve the precision of spacecraft orbit maneuvers in low Earth orbit under the influence of solar radiation pressure. A full order observer based feedback control framework is developed to estimate system states and compensate for external disturbances during the trajectory correction phase following main engine cut off. The maneuver trajectory is generated using Lambert guidance, while the observer based controller ensures accurate tracking of the target orbit despite SRP perturbations. The effectiveness of the proposed design is assessed through stability, observability, and controllability analyses. Stability is validated by step-response simulations and eigenvalue distributions of the system dynamics. Observability is demonstrated through state matrix rank analysis, confirming complete state estimation. Controllability is verified using state feedback rank conditions and corresponding control performance plots. Comparative simulations highlight that, in contrast to uncontrolled or conventional control cases, the observer based controller achieves improved trajectory accuracy and robust disturbance rejection with moderate control effort. These findings indicate that observer-based feedback control offers a reliable and scalable solution for precision orbital maneuvering in LEO missions subject to environmental disturbances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11244v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language-Agnostic Visual Embeddings for Cross-Script Handwriting Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11248</link><description>arXiv:2601.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11248v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VLAgents: A Policy Server for Efficient VLA Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11250</link><description>arXiv:2601.11250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) has a significant impact on robotics. However, their deployment remains complex due to the fragmented interfaces and the inherent communication latency in distributed setups. To address this, we introduce VLAgents, a modular policy server that abstracts VLA inferencing behind a unified Gymnasium-style protocol. Crucially, its communication layer transparently adapts to the context by supporting both zero-copy shared memory for high-speed simulation and compressed streaming for remote hardware. In this work, we present the architecture of VLAgents and validate it by integrating seven policies -- including OpenVLA and Pi Zero. In a benchmark with both local and remote communication, we further demonstrate how it outperforms the default policy servers provided by OpenVLA, OpenPi, and LeRobot.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at multi-step reasoning but often suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational cost and degrades performance. Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11252v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FTDMamba: Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11254</link><description>arXiv:2601.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11254v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning in Trees: Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11255</link><description>arXiv:2601.11255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-hop question answering (QA). For multi-hop QA tasks, current iterative approaches predominantly rely on LLMs to self-guide and plan multi-step exploration paths during retrieval, leading to substantial challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence across steps from inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation. To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation. Comprehensive experiments show that RT-RAG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM, demonstrating the effectiveness of RT-RAG in complex multi-hop QA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11255v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rate-Distortion-Perception Tradeoff for the Gray-Wyner Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11257</link><description>arXiv:2601.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Gray-Wyner lossy source coding problem and derive the first-order asymptotic optimal rate-distortion-perception region when additional perception constraints are imposed on reproduced source sequences. The optimal trade-off is shown to be governed by a mutual information term involving common information and two conditional rate-distortion-perception functions. The perception constraint requires that the distribution of each reproduced sequence is close to that of the original source sequence, which is motivated by practical applications in image and video compression. Prior studies usually focus on the compression and reconstruction of a single source sequence. In this paper, we generalize the prior results for point-to-point systems to the representative multi-terminal setting of the Gray-Wyner problem with two correlated source sequences. In particular, we integrate the analyses of the distortion and the perception constraints by including the random circular shift operator in the encoding and decoding process directly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowledge is Not Enough: Injecting RL Skills for Continual Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11258</link><description>arXiv:2601.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face the "knowledge cutoff" challenge, where their frozen parametric memory prevents direct internalization of new information. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11258v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Networks for model order reduction of parameterized time-dependent PDEs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11259</link><description>arXiv:2601.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) employing unsupervised learning methods inspired by neural plasticity are expected to be a new framework for artificial intelligence. In this study, we investigated the effect of multiple types of neural plasticity, such as spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) and synaptic scaling, on the learning in a winner-take-all (WTA) network composed of spiking neurons. We implemented a WTA network with multiple types of neural plasticity using Python. The MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets were used for training and testing. We varied the number of neurons, the time constant of STDP, and the normalization method used in synaptic scaling to compare classification accuracy. The results demonstrated that synaptic scaling based on the L2 norm was the most effective in improving classification performance. By implementing L2-norm-based synaptic scaling and setting the number of neurons in both excitatory and inhibitory layers to 400, the network achieved classification accuracies of 88.84 % on the MNIST dataset and 68.01 % on the Fashion-MNIST dataset after one epoch of training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Music Cover Retrieval Using Lyrics-Aligned Audio Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11262</link><description>arXiv:2601.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music Cover Retrieval, also known as Version Identification, aims to recognize distinct renditions of the same underlying musical work, a task central to catalog management, copyright enforcement, and music retrieval. State-of-the-art approaches have largely focused on harmonic and melodic features, employing increasingly complex audio pipelines designed to be invariant to musical attributes that often vary widely across covers. While effective, these methods demand substantial training time and computational resources. By contrast, lyrics constitute a strong invariant across covers, though their use has been limited by the difficulty of extracting them accurately and efficiently from polyphonic audio. Early methods relied on simple frameworks that limited downstream performance, while more recent systems deliver stronger results but require large models integrated within complex multimodal architectures. We introduce LIVI (Lyrics-Informed Version Identification), an approach that seeks to balance retrieval accuracy with computational efficiency. First, LIVI leverages supervision from state-of-the-art transcription and text embedding models during training to achieve retrieval accuracy on par with--or superior to--harmonic-based systems. Second, LIVI remains lightweight and efficient by removing the transcription step at inference, challenging the dominance of complexity-heavy pipelines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sample-Near-Optimal Agnostic Boosting with Improved Running Time</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11265</link><description>arXiv:2601.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boosting is a powerful method that turns weak learners, which perform only slightly better than random guessing, into strong learners with high accuracy. While boosting is well understood in the classic setting, it is less so in the agnostic case, where no assumptions are made about the data. Indeed, only recently was the sample complexity of agnostic boosting nearly settled arXiv:2503.09384, but the known algorithm achieving this bound has exponential running time. In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11265v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Skill-Aware Diffusion for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11266</link><description>arXiv:2601.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust generalization in robotic manipulation is crucial for robots to adapt flexibly to diverse environments. Existing methods usually improve generalization by scaling data and networks, but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information. Observing that tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns, we propose Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff), which explicitly incorporates skill-level information to improve generalization. SADiff learns skill-specific representations through a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, and conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow. A skill-retrieval transformation strategy further exploits skill-specific trajectory priors to refine the mapping from 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions. Furthermore, we introduce IsaacSkill, a high-fidelity dataset containing fundamental robotic skills for comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11269v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rank4Gen: RAG-Preference-Aligned Document Set Selection and Ranking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11273</link><description>arXiv:2601.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the RAG paradigm, the information retrieval module provides context for generators by retrieving and ranking multiple documents to support the aggregation of evidence. However, existing ranking models are primarily optimized for query--document relevance, which often misaligns with generators' preferences for evidence selection and citation, limiting their impact on response quality. Moreover, most approaches do not account for preference differences across generators, resulting in unstable cross-generator performance. We propose \textbf{Rank4Gen}, a generator-aware ranker for RAG that targets the goal of \emph{Ranking for Generators}. Rank4Gen introduces two key preference modeling strategies: (1) \textbf{From Ranking Relevance to Response Quality}, which optimizes ranking with respect to downstream response quality rather than query--document relevance; and (2) \textbf{Generator-Specific Preference Modeling}, which conditions a single ranker on different generators to capture their distinct ranking preferences. To enable such modeling, we construct \textbf{PRISM}, a dataset built from multiple open-source corpora and diverse downstream generators. Experiments on five challenging and recent RAG benchmarks demonstrate that RRank4Gen achieves strong and competitive performance for complex evidence composition in RAG.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From SERPs to Sound: How Search Engine Result Pages and AI-generated Podcasts Interact to Influence User Attitudes on Controversial Topics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11282</link><description>arXiv:2601.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to search engine result pages (SERPs), AI-generated podcasts represent a relatively new and relatively more passive modality of information consumption, delivering narratives in a naturally engaging format. As these two media increasingly converge in everyday information-seeking behavior, it is essential to explore how their interaction influences user attitudes, particularly in contexts involving controversial, value-laden, and often debated topics. Addressing this need, we aim to understand how information mediums of present-day SERPs and AI-generated podcasts interact to shape the opinions of users. To this end, through a controlled user study (N=483), we investigated user attitudinal effects of consuming information via SERPs and AI-generated podcasts, focusing on how the sequence and modality of exposure shape user opinions. A majority of users in our study corresponded to attitude change outcomes, and we found an effect of sequence on attitude change. Our results further revealed a role of viewpoint bias and the degree of topic controversiality in shaping attitude change, although we found no effect of individual moderators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11282v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Metabolomic Biomarker Discovery for ADHD Diagnosis Using Interpretable Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11283</link><description>arXiv:2601.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with limited objective diagnostic tools, highlighting the urgent need for objective, biology-based diagnostic frameworks in precision psychiatry. We integrate urinary metabolomics with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify biochemical signatures associated with ADHD. Targeted metabolomic profiles from 52 ADHD and 46 control participants were analyzed using a Closest Resemblance (CR) classifier with embedded feature selection. The CR model outperformed Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, achieving an AUC &gt; 0.97 based on a reduced panel of 14 metabolites. These metabolites including dopamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and citrulline map to dopaminergic neurotransmission and amino acid metabolism pathways, offering mechanistic insight into ADHD pathophysiology. The CR classifier's transparent decision boundaries and low computational cost support integration into targeted metabolomic assays and future point of care diagnostic platforms. Overall, this work demonstrates a translational framework combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning to advance objective, biologically informed diagnostic strategies for ADHD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11283v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Can You Tell Me?": Designing Copilots to Support Human Judgement in Online Information Seeking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11284</link><description>arXiv:2601.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are transforming information seeking, but their fluent, authoritative responses risk overreliance and discourage independent verification and reasoning. Rather than replacing the cognitive work of users, GenAI systems should be designed to support and scaffold it. Therefore, this paper introduces an LLM-based conversational copilot designed to scaffold information evaluation rather than provide answers and foster digital literacy skills. In a pre-registered, randomised controlled trial (N=261) examining three interface conditions including a chat-based copilot, our mixed-methods analysis reveals that users engaged deeply with the copilot, demonstrating metacognitive reflection. However, the copilot did not significantly improve answer correctness or search engagement, largely due to a "time-on-chat vs. exploration" trade-off and users' bias toward positive information. Qualitative findings reveal tension between the copilot's Socratic approach and users' desire for efficiency. These results highlight both the promise and pitfalls of pedagogical copilots, and we outline design pathways to reconcile literacy goals with efficiency demands.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] XChoice: Explainable Evaluation of AI-Human Alignment in LLM-based Constrained Choice Decision Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11286</link><description>arXiv:2601.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present XChoice, an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making. Moving beyond outcome agreement such as accuracy and F1 score, XChoice fits a mechanism-based decision model to human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters that capture the relative importance of decision factors, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing these parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups. We demonstrate XChoice on Americans' daily time allocation using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) as human ground truth, revealing heterogeneous alignment across models and activities and salient misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. We further validate robustness of XChoice via an invariance analysis and evaluate targeted mitigation with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) intervention. Overall, XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11286v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Seek and You Shall Find: Design &amp; Evaluation of a Context-Aware Interactive Search Companion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11287</link><description>arXiv:2601.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many users struggle with effective online search and critical evaluation, especially in high-stakes domains like health, while often overestimating their digital literacy. Thus, in this demo, we present an interactive search companion that seamlessly integrates expert search strategies into existing search engine result pages. Providing context-aware tips on clarifying information needs, improving query formulation, encouraging result exploration, and mitigating biases, our companion aims to foster reflective search behaviour while minimising cognitive burden. A user study demonstrates the companion's successful encouragement of more active and exploratory search, leading users to submit 75 % more queries and view roughly twice as many results, as well as performance gains in difficult tasks. This demo illustrates how lightweight, contextual guidance can enhance search literacy and empower users through micro-learning opportunities. While the vision involves real-time LLM adaptivity, this study utilises a controlled implementation to test the underlying intervention strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11287v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient On-Board Processing of Oblique UAV Video for Rapid Flood Extent Mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11290</link><description>arXiv:2601.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (&lt; 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11290v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Joint Antenna Rotation and IRS Beamforming for Multi-User Uplink Communications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11291</link><description>arXiv:2601.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) enhances wireless coverage through directional gain steering, yet suffers from performance degradation under physical blockages. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) establishes reflective paths to bypass obstacles, but suffers from angular mismatch when deployed in the side-lobe region of base station (BS) antennas. To address this issue, we propose a new RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system, in which the BS antennas are capable of flexibly adjusting their 3D orientations to align their boresights with the IRS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the antenna 3D rotations, receive beamforming and IRS phase shifts. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively update the antenna rotations via projected gradient ascent (PGA), compute the receive beamforming via a closed-form solution, and optimize the IRS phase shifts via fractional programming (FP). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system yields significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11291v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OpenACM: An Open-Source SRAM-Based Approximate CiM Compiler</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11292</link><description>arXiv:2601.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of data-intensive AI workloads has exacerbated the ``memory wall'' bottleneck. Digital Compute-in-Memory (DCiM) using SRAM offers a scalable solution, but its vast design space makes manual design impractical, creating a need for automated compilers. A key opportunity lies in approximate computing, which leverages the error tolerance of AI applications for significant energy savings. However, existing DCiM compilers focus on exact arithmetic, failing to exploit this optimization. This paper introduces OpenACM, the first open-source, accuracy-aware compiler for SRAM-based approximate DCiM architectures. OpenACM bridges the gap between application error tolerance and hardware automation. Its key contribution is an integrated library of accuracy-configurable multipliers (exact, tunable approximate, and logarithmic), enabling designers to make fine-grained accuracy-energy trade-offs. The compiler automates the generation of the DCiM architecture, integrating a transistor-level customizable SRAM macro with variation-aware characterization into a complete, open-source physical design flow based on OpenROAD and the FreePDK45 library. This ensures full reproducibility and accessibility, removing dependencies on proprietary tools. Experimental results on representative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate that OpenACM achieves energy savings of up to 64\% with negligible loss in application accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping automated fact-checking (AFC) by enabling unified, end-to-end verification pipelines rather than isolated components. While large proprietary models achieve strong performance, their closed weights, complexity, and high costs limit sustainability. Fine-tuning smaller open weight models for individual AFC tasks can help but requires multiple specialized models resulting in high costs. We propose \textbf{multi-task learning (MTL)} as a more efficient alternative that fine-tunes a single model to perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection jointly. Using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b), we explore three MTL strategies: classification heads, causal language modeling heads, and instruction-tuning, and evaluate them across model sizes, task orders, and standard non-LLM baselines. While multitask models do not universally surpass single-task baselines, they yield substantial improvements, achieving up to \textbf{44\%}, \textbf{54\%}, and \textbf{31\%} relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings. Finally, we also provide practical, empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners apply MTL with LLMs for automated fact-checking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11293v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automation and Reuse Practices in GitHub Actions Workflows: A Practitioner's Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11299</link><description>arXiv:2601.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GitHub natively supports workflow automation through GitHub Actions. Yet, workflow maintenance is often considered a burden for software developers, who frequently face difficulties in writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining workflows. Little knowledge exists concerning the automation and reuse practices favoured by workflow practitioners. We therefore surveyed 419 practitioners to elucidate good and bad workflow development practices and to identify opportunities for supporting workflow maintenance. Specifically, we investigate the tasks that practitioners tend to automate using GitHub Actions, their preferred workflow creation mechanisms, and the non-functional characteristics they prioritise. We also examine the practices and challenges associated with GitHub's workflow reuse mechanisms. We observe a tendency to focus automation efforts on core CI/CD tasks, with less emphasis on crucial areas like security analysis and performance monitoring. Practitioners strongly rely on reusable Actions, but reusable workflows see less frequent adoption. Furthermore, we observed challenges with Action versioning and maintenance. Copy-pasting remains a common practice to have more control and avoid the complexity of depending on reusable components. These insights suggest the need for improved tooling, enhanced support for a wide range of automation tasks, and better mechanisms for discovering, managing, and trusting reusable workflow components.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11299v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAMannot: A Memory-Efficient, Local, Open-source Framework for Interactive Video Instance Segmentation based on SAM2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11301</link><description>arXiv:2601.11301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation via Stage-Wise Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11310</link><description>arXiv:2601.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol.

Abstract: Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Membership Inference on LLMs in the Wild</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11314</link><description>arXiv:2601.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) act as a crucial auditing tool for the opaque training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing techniques predominantly rely on inaccessible model internals (e.g., logits) or suffer from poor generalization across domains in strict black-box settings where only generated text is available. In this work, we propose SimMIA, a robust MIA framework tailored for this text-only regime by leveraging an advanced sampling strategy and scoring mechanism. Furthermore, we present WikiMIA-25, a new benchmark curated to evaluate MIA performance on modern proprietary LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art results in the black-box setting, rivaling baselines that exploit internal model information.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11314v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constructing Orthonormal Rational Function Vectors with an application in Rational Approximation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11317</link><description>arXiv:2601.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two algorithms for constructing orthonormal bases of rational function vectors with respect to a discrete inner product, and discuss how to use them for a rational approximation problem. Building on the pencil-based formulation of the inverse generalized eigenvalue problem by Van Buggenhout et al.\ (2022), we extend it to rational vectors of arbitrary length $k$, where the recurrence relations are represented by a pair of $k$-Hessenberg matrices, i.e., matrices with possibly $k$ nonzero subdiagonals. An updating algorithm based on similarity transformations using rotations and a Krylov-type algorithm related to the rational Arnoldi method are derived. The performance is demonstrated on the rational approximation of $\sqrt{z}$ on $[0,1]$, where the optimal lightning + polynomial convergence rate of Herremans, Huybrechs, and Trefethen (2023) is successfully recovered. This illustrates the robustness of the proposed methods for handling exponentially clustered poles near singularities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11317v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Vision Language Models with Logic Reasoning for Situational Awareness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11322</link><description>arXiv:2601.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11322v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Composite and Staged Trust Evaluation for Multi-Hop Collaborator Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11323</link><description>arXiv:2601.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop collaboration offers new perspectives for enhancing task execution efficiency by increasing available distributed collaborators for resource sharing. Consequently, selecting trustworthy collaborators becomes critical for realizing effective multi-hop collaboration. However, evaluating device trust requires the consideration of multiple factors, including relatively stable factors, such as historical interaction data, and dynamic factors, such as varying resources and network conditions. This differentiation makes it challenging to achieve the accurate evaluation of composite trust factors using one identical evaluation approach. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a composite and staged trust evaluation (CSTE) mechanism, where stable and dynamic factors are separately evaluated at different stages and then integrated for a final trust decision. First, a device interaction graph is constructed from stable historical interaction data to represent direct trust relationships between devices. A graph neural network framework is then used to propagate and aggregate these trust relationships to produce the historical trustworthiness of devices. In addition, a task-specific trust evaluation method is developed to assess the dynamic resources of devices based on task requirements, which generates the task-specific resource trustworthiness of devices. After these evaluations, CSTE integrates their results to identify devices within the network topology that satisfy the minimum trust thresholds of tasks. These identified devices then establish a trusted topology. Finally, within this trusted topology, an A* search algorithm is employed to construct a multi-hop collaboration path that satisfies the task requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that CSTE outperforms the comparison algorithms in identifying paths with the highest average trust values.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GENPACK: KPI-Guided Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Industrial 3D Bin Packing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11325</link><description>arXiv:2601.11325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is a longstanding challenge in operations research and logistics. Classical heuristics and constructive methods can generate packings quickly, but often fail to address industrial constraints such as stability, balance, and handling feasibility. Metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (GAs) provide flexibility and the ability to optimize across multiple objectives; however, pure GA approaches frequently struggle with efficiency, parameter sensitivity, and scalability to industrial order sizes. This gap is especially evident when scaling to real-world pallet dimensions, where even state-of-the-art algorithms often fail to achieve robust, deployable solutions. We propose a KPI-driven GA-based pipeline for industrial 3D-BPP that integrates key performance indicators directly into a multi-objective fitness function. The methodology combines a layer-based chromosome representation with domain-specific operators and constructive heuristics to balance efficiency and feasibility. On the BED-BPP benchmark of 1,500 real-world orders, our Hybrid-GA pipeline consistently outperforms heuristic- and learning-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 35% higher space utilization and 15 to 20% stronger surface support, with lower variance across orders. These improvements come at a modest runtime cost but remain feasible for batch-scale deployment, yielding stable, balanced, and space-efficient packings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11325v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning on the Edge for Sustainable IoT Networks: A Systematic Literature Review</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11326</link><description>arXiv:2601.11326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has become integral to modern technology, enhancing daily life and industrial processes through seamless connectivity. However, the rapid expansion of IoT systems presents significant sustainability challenges, such as high energy consumption and inefficient resource management. Addressing these issues is critical for the long-term viability of IoT networks. Machine learning (ML), with its proven success across various domains, offers promising solutions for optimizing IoT operations. ML algorithms can learn directly from raw data, uncovering hidden patterns and optimizing processes in dynamic environments. Executing ML at the edge of IoT networks can further enhance sustainability by reducing bandwidth usage, enabling real-time decision-making, and improving data privacy. Additionally, testing ML models on actual hardware is essential to ensure satisfactory performance under real-world conditions, as it captures the complexities and constraints of real-world IoT deployments. Combining ML at the edge and actual hardware testing, therefore, increases the reliability of ML models to effectively improve the sustainability of IoT systems. The present systematic literature review explores how ML can be utilized to enhance the sustainability of IoT networks, examining current methodologies, benefits, challenges, and future opportunities. Through our analysis, we aim to provide insights that will drive future innovations in making IoT networks more sustainable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can Small Agent Collaboration Beat a Single Big LLM?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11327</link><description>arXiv:2601.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report studies whether small, tool-augmented agents can match or outperform larger monolithic models on the GAIA benchmark. Using Qwen3 models (4B-32B) within an adapted Agentic-Reasoning framework, we isolate the effects of model scale, explicit thinking (no thinking, planner-only, or full), and tool use (search, code, mind-map). Tool augmentation provides the largest and most consistent gains. Using tools, 4B models can outperform 32B models without tool access on GAIA in our experimental setup. In contrast, explicit thinking is highly configuration- and difficulty-dependent: planner-only thinking can improve decomposition and constraint tracking, while unrestricted full thinking often degrades performance by destabilizing tool orchestration, leading to skipped verification steps, excessive tool calls, non-termination, and output-format drift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11327v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProjecTA: A Semi-Humanoid Robotic Teaching Assistant with In-Situ Projection for Guided Tours</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11328</link><description>arXiv:2601.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic teaching assistants (TAs) often use body-mounted screens to deliver content. In nomadic, walk-and-talk learning, such as tours in makerspaces, these screens can distract learners from real-world objects, increasing extraneous cognitive load. HCI research lacks empirical comparisons of potential alternatives, such as robots with in-situ projection versus screen-based counterparts; little knowledge has been derived for designing such alternatives. We introduce ProjecTA, a semi-humanoid, gesture-capable TA that guides learners while projecting near-object overlays coordinated with speech and gestures. In a mixed-method study (N=24) in a university makerspace, ProjecTA significantly reduced extraneous load and outperformed its screen-based counterpart in perceived usability, usefulness of visual display, and cross-modal complementarity. Qualitative analyses revealed how ProjecTA's coordinated projections, gestures, and speech anchored explanations in place and time, enhancing understanding in ways a screen could not. We derive key design implications for future robotic TAs leveraging spatial projection to support mobile learning in physical environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] F-Actor: Controllable Conversational Behaviour in Full-Duplex Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11329</link><description>arXiv:2601.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken conversational systems require more than accurate speech generation to have human-like conversations: to feel natural and engaging, they must produce conversational behaviour that adapts dynamically to the context. Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation. We propose a single-stage training protocol and systematically analyze design choices. Both the model and training code will be released to enable reproducible research on controllable full-duplex speech systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Idea First, Code Later: Disentangling Problem Solving from Code Generation in Evaluating LLMs for Competitive Programming</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11332</link><description>arXiv:2601.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly succeed on competitive programming problems, yet existing evaluations conflate algorithmic reasoning with code-level implementation. We argue that competitive programming is fundamentally a problem-solving task and propose centering natural-language editorials in both solution generation and evaluation. Generating an editorial prior to code improves solve rates for some LLMs, with substantially larger gains when using expertly written gold editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation. We introduce a dataset of 83 ICPC-style problems with gold editorials and full test suites, and evaluate 19 LLMs, arguing that future benchmarks should explicitly separate problem solving from implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11332v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Information Theoretic Perspective on Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11334</link><description>arXiv:2601.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An information-theoretic framework is introduced to analyze last-layer embedding, focusing on learned representations for regression tasks. We define representation-rate and derive limits on the reliability with which input-output information can be represented as is inherently determined by the input-source entropy. We further define representation capacity in a perturbed setting, and representation rate-distortion for a compressed output. We derive the achievable capacity, the achievable representation-rate, and their converse. Finally, we combine the results in a unified setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distributed Control Barrier Functions for Safe Multi-Vehicle Navigation in Heterogeneous USV Fleets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11335</link><description>arXiv:2601.11335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision avoidance in heterogeneous fleets of uncrewed vessels is challenging because the decision-making processes and controllers often differ between platforms, and it is further complicated by the limitations on sharing trajectories and control values in real-time. This paper presents a pragmatic approach that addresses these issues by adding a control filter on each autonomous vehicle that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts, including crewed vessels. This distributed safety control filter is developed using control barrier function (CBF) theory and the application is clearly described to ensure explainability of these safety-critical methods. This work compares the worst-case CBF approach with a Collision Regulations (COLREGS) behavior-based approach in simulated encounters. Real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human operated vessel were performed to confirm the approach is effective across a range of platforms and is robust to uncooperative behavior from human operators. Results show that combining both CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors achieves the best safety and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11335v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beer-Lambert Autoencoder for Unsupervised Stain Representation Learning and Deconvolution in Multi-immunohistochemical Brightfield Histology Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11336</link><description>arXiv:2601.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K&gt;3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has significantly enhanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models. Unfortunately, current models generate reasoning steps sequentially without foresight, often becoming trapped in suboptimal reasoning paths with redundant steps. In contrast, we introduce Neural Chain-of-Thought Search (NCoTS), a framework that reformulates reasoning as a dynamic search for the optimal thinking strategy. By quantitatively characterizing the solution space, we reveal the existence of sparse superior reasoning paths that are simultaneously more accurate and concise than standard outputs. Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that optimizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22%.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11342v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Much Would a Clinician Edit This Draft?

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in drafting responses to patient portal messages, yet their integration into clinical workflows raises various concerns, including whether they would actually save clinicians time and effort in their portal workload. We investigate LLM alignment with individual clinicians through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient message response drafting task. We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients. Theme-driven adaptation strategies yield improvements across most themes. Our findings underscore the necessity of adapting LLMs to individual clinician preferences to enable reliable and responsible use in patient-clinician communication workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11344v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FEATHer: Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster for Time-Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11350</link><description>arXiv:2601.11350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental in industrial domains like manufacturing and smart factories. As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11350v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Offline Reinforcement-Learning-Based Power Control for Application-Agnostic Energy Efficiency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11352</link><description>arXiv:2601.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AstroReason-Bench: Evaluating Unified Agentic Planning across Heterogeneous Space Planning Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11354</link><description>arXiv:2601.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as generalist planners capable of reasoning and acting across diverse tasks. However, existing agent benchmarks largely focus on symbolic or weakly grounded environments, leaving their performance in physics-constrained real-world domains underexplored. We introduce AstroReason-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic planning in Space Planning Problems (SPP), a family of high-stakes problems with heterogeneous objectives, strict physical constraints, and long-horizon decision-making. AstroReason-Bench integrates multiple scheduling regimes, including ground station communication and agile Earth observation, and provides a unified agent-oriented interaction protocol. Evaluating on a range of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source agentic LLM systems, we find that current agents substantially underperform specialized solvers, highlighting key limitations of generalist planning under realistic constraints. AstroReason-Bench offers a challenging and diagnostic testbed for future agentic research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11354v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing Building Heat Resilience Using UAV and Street-View Imagery with Coupled Global Context Vision Transformer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11357</link><description>arXiv:2601.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11357v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cutting Corners on Uncertainty: Zonotope Abstractions for Stream-based Runtime Monitoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11358</link><description>arXiv:2601.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stream-based monitoring assesses the health of safety-critical systems by transforming input streams of sensor measurements into output streams that determine a verdict. These inputs are often treated as accurate representations of the physical state, although real sensors introduce calibration and measurement errors. Such errors propagate through the monitor's computations and can distort the final verdict. Affine arithmetic with symbolic slack variables can track these errors precisely, but independent measurement noise introduces a fresh slack variable upon each measurement event, causing the monitor's state representation to grow without bound over time. Therefore, any bounded-memory monitoring algorithm must unify slack variables at runtime in a way that generates a sound approximation.
  This paper introduces zonotopes as an abstract domain for online monitoring of RLola specifications. We demonstrate that zonotopes precisely capture the affine state of the monitor and that their over-approximation produces a sound bounded-memory monitor. We present a comparison of different zonotope over-approximation strategies in the context of runtime monitoring, evaluating their performance and false-positive rates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11358v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Think-Clip-Sample: Slow-Fast Frame Selection for Video Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11359</link><description>arXiv:2601.11359v1 Announce Type: new

Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RITA: A Tool for Automated Requirements Classification and Specification from Online User Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11362</link><description>arXiv:2601.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context and motivation. Online user feedback is a valuable resource for requirements engineering, but its volume and noise make analysis difficult. Existing tools support individual feedback analysis tasks, but their capabilities are rarely integrated into end-to-end support. Problem. The lack of end-to-end integration limits the practical adoption of existing RE tools and makes it difficult to assess their real-world usefulness. Solution. To address this challenge, we present RITA, a tool that integrates lightweight open-source large language models into a unified workflow for feedback-driven RE. RITA supports automated request classification, non-functional requirement identification, and natural-language requirements specification generation from online feedback via a user-friendly interface, and integrates with Jira for seamless transfer of requirements specifications to development tools. Results and conclusions. RITA exploits previously evaluated LLM-based RE techniques to efficiently transform raw user feedback into requirements artefacts, helping bridge the gap between research and practice.

Abstract: It has been ten years since the term ''Immersive Analytics'' (IA) was coined and research interest in the topic remains strong. Researchers in this field have produced practical and conceptual knowledge concerning the use of emerging immersive spatial display and interaction technologies for sense-making tasks through a number of papers, surveys, and books. However, a lack of truly physically and psychologically ergonomic techniques, as well as standardized human-centric validation protocols for these, remains a significant barrier to wider acceptance of practical IA systems in ubiquitous applications. Building upon a series of workshops on immersive analytics at various conferences, this workshop aims to explore new approaches and establish standard practices for evaluating immersive analytics systems from a human factors perspective. We will gather immersive analytics researchers and practitioners to look closely at these human factors -- including cognitive and physical functions as well as behaviour and performance -- to see how they inform the design and deployment of immersive analytics techniques and applications and to inform future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Institutional AI: Governing LLM Collusion in Multi-Agent Cournot Markets via Public Governance Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11369</link><description>arXiv:2601.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent LLM ensembles can converge on coordinated, socially harmful equilibria. This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure. These results suggest that multi-agent alignment may benefit from being framed as an institutional design problem, where governance graphs can provide a tractable abstraction for alignment-relevant collective behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11369v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Minimizing the Cost of EFx Allocations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11372</link><description>arXiv:2601.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness while limiting costs, such as transportation or storage, is an important challenge in resource allocation, yet most work has focused on cost minimization without fairness or fairness without explicit cost considerations. We introduce and formally define the minCost-EFx Allocation problem, where the objective is to compute an allocation that is envy-free up to any item (EFx) and has minimum cost. We investigate the algorithmic complexity of this problem, proving that it is NP-hard already with two agents. On the positive side, we show that the problem admits a polynomial kernel with respect to the number of items, implying that a core source of intractability lies in the number of items. Building on this, we identify parameter-restricted settings that are tractable, including cases with bounded valuations and a constant number of agents, or a limited number of item types under restricted cost models. Finally, we turn to cost approximation, proving that for any $\rho&gt;1$ the problem is not $\rho$-approximable in polynomial time (unless $P=NP$), while also identifying restricted cost models where costs are agent-specific and independent of the actual items received, which admit better approximation guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11372v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Polar Orbit Decoding: Universal Parallel Soft Decoding via Automorphism Orbits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11373</link><description>arXiv:2601.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary linear block codes (BLBCs) form the foundation of modern communication systems, yet no single code family simultaneously optimizes all performance aspects. This leads to the widely used multi-code architecture in the standard, significantly increasing the hardware complexity since multiple decoders are required in each piece of equipment. A universal decoding framework based on polar transformations has recently been proposed to unify BLBC decoding under polar-style decoders, but its parallelization has not yet been discussed. In this work, we propose Polar Orbit Decoding (POD), a universal parallel decoding framework for BLBCs. We identify that the automorphisms of BLBCs generate an orbit of permutations that induce diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after the polar transformations. By decoding over this automorphism orbit in parallel, POD achieves substantial latency-performance tradeoffs without requiring frozen-set readaptation or extra exhaustive permutation searches. Moreover, to enable efficient orbit traversal in the implementation, we represent the automorphism group in a base and strong generating set (BSGS) form using Schreier-Sims algorithms, making offline systematic computation accessible in polynomial time. Simulation results on extended BCH and extended Golay codes demonstrate that POD can achieve maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing the decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11373v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reward Modeling for Scientific Writing Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11374</link><description>arXiv:2601.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific writing is an expert-domain task that demands deep domain knowledge, task-specific requirements and reasoning capabilities that leverage the domain knowledge to satisfy the task specifications. While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities. Our multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks enable fine-grained assessment and robustness to dynamic criteria and scoring rubrics. Experimental analysis shows that our training regime strongly improves LLM-based scientific writing evaluation. Our models generalize effectively across tasks and to previously unseen scientific writing evaluation settings, allowing a single trained evaluator to be reused without task-specific retraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11374v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating LLM Behavior in Hiring: Implicit Weights, Fairness Across Groups, and Alignment with Human Preferences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11379</link><description>arXiv:2601.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in recruitment applications, where decisions require reasoning over unstructured text, balancing multiple criteria, and inferring fit and competence from indirect productivity signals. Yet, it is still uncertain how LLMs assign importance to each attribute and whether such assignments are in line with economic principles, recruiter preferences or broader societal norms. We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM's decision logic in recruitment, by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit. We identify which attributes the LLM prioritizes and analyze how these weights vary across project contexts and demographic subgroups. Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions. Our findings reveal that the LLM weighs core productivity signals, such as skills and experience, but interprets certain features beyond their explicit matching value. While showing minimal average discrimination against minority groups, intersectional effects reveal that productivity signals carry different weights between demographic groups.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11379v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] X-raying the arXiv: A Large-Scale Analysis of arXiv Submissions' Source Files</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11385</link><description>arXiv:2601.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: arXiv is the largest open-access repository for scientific literature. When submitting a paper, authors upload the manuscript's source files, from which the final PDF is compiled. These source files are also publicly downloadable, potentially exposing data unrelated to the published paper -- such as figures, documents, or comments -- that may unintentionally reveal confidential information or simply waste storage space. We thus ask ourselves: "What can be found within the source files of arXiv submissions?"
  We present a longitudinal analysis of ~600,000 submissions appeared on arXiv between 2015--2025. For each submission, we examine the uploaded source files to quantify and characterize data not required for producing the respective PDF. On average, 27% of the data in each submission are unnecessary, totaling &gt;580 GB of redundant content across our dataset. Qualitative inspection reveals the presence of offensive/inappropriate text (e.g., "WTF does this mean?") and experimental details that could disclose ongoing research. We have contacted arXiv's leadership team, as well as the authors of affected papers to alert them of these issues. Finally, we propose recommendations and an automated tool to detect and analyze arXiv submissions residual data at scale, aiming to improve data hygiene in the arXiv's ecosystem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11385v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hyperparameter Optimization of Constraint Programming Solvers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11389</link><description>arXiv:2601.11389v1 Announce Type: new

In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.
  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.
  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided Composed Image Retrieval with Fine-Grained Probabilistic Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11393</link><description>arXiv:2601.11393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11393v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Mini Wheelbot Dataset: High-Fidelity Data for Robot Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11394</link><description>arXiv:2601.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of robust learning-based control algorithms for unstable systems requires high-quality, real-world data, yet access to specialized robotic hardware remains a significant barrier for many researchers. This paper introduces a comprehensive dynamics dataset for the Mini Wheelbot, an open-source, quasi-symmetric balancing reaction wheel unicycle. The dataset provides 1 kHz synchronized data encompassing all onboard sensor readings, state estimates, ground-truth poses from a motion capture system, and third-person video logs. To ensure data diversity, we include experiments across multiple hardware instances and surfaces using various control paradigms, including pseudo-random binary excitation, nonlinear model predictive control, and reinforcement learning agents. We include several example applications in dynamics model learning, state estimation, and time-series classification to illustrate common robotics algorithms that can be benchmarked on our dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11394v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SUG-Occ: An Explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Framework for Real-Time 3D Occupancy Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11396</link><description>arXiv:2601.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11396v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Space Inference via Paired Autoencoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11397</link><description>arXiv:2601.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11397v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Help Seeking for Digital Privacy, Safety, and Security</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11398</link><description>arXiv:2601.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of navigating digital privacy, safety, and security threats often falls directly on users. This leads to users seeking help from family and peers, platforms and advice guides, dedicated communities, and even large language models (LLMs). As a precursor to improving resources across this ecosystem, our community needs to understand what help seeking looks like in the wild. To that end, we blend qualitative coding with LLM fine-tuning to sift through over one billion Reddit posts from the last four years to identify where and for what users seek digital privacy, safety, or security help. We isolate three million relevant posts with 93% precision and recall and automatically annotate each with the topics discussed (e.g., security tools, privacy configurations, scams, account compromise, content moderation, and more). We use this dataset to understand the scope and scale of help seeking, the communities that provide help, and the types of help sought. Our work informs the development of better resources for users (e.g., user guides or LLM help-giving agents) while underscoring the inherent challenges of supporting users through complex combinations of threats, platforms, mitigations, context, and emotions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11398v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wetland mapping from sparse annotations with satellite image time series and temporal-aware segment anything model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11400</link><description>arXiv:2601.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11400v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Factored Value Functions for Graph-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11401</link><description>arXiv:2601.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11401v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SME-YOLO: A Real-Time Detector for Tiny Defect Detection on PCB Surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11402</link><description>arXiv:2601.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) directly compromise product reliability and safety. However, achieving high-precision detection is challenging because PCB defects are typically characterized by tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on YOLOv11n, named SME-YOLO (Small-target Multi-scale Enhanced YOLO). First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects. Second, the original upsampling module is replaced by the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB). By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, SME-YOLO improves mAP by 2.2% and Precision by 4%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ACoT-VLA: Action Chain-of-Thought for Vision-Language-Action Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11404</link><description>arXiv:2601.11404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11404v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Solving the Fisher nonlinear differential equations via Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Retraining Study and Comparative Analysis with the Finite Difference Method</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11406</link><description>arXiv:2601.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a groundbreaking paradigm in scientific computing, seamlessly integrating the robust framework of deep learning with fundamental physical laws. This paper meticulously applies the standard PINN framework to solve the challenging one-dimensional nonlinear Fisher-KPP equation, a critical model in reaction-diffusion dynamics describing phenomena such as population spread and flame propagation. We detail a comprehensive methodology, encompassing the neural network architecture, the physics-informed loss function, and an in-depth investigation into retraining strategies aimed at optimizing model performance. Our approach is rigorously validated through a direct comparison of the PINN solution against both the known analytical solution and a numerical solution derived from the Finite Difference Method (FDM). Through this work, we elucidate the intricate balance between model complexity, training efficiency, and accuracy. Results highlight the PINN's remarkable capability in accurately approximating the solution to this complex PDE, while also shedding light on the critical aspects and challenges of model retraining, particularly concerning the optimizer's state. This study provides a thorough quantitative error analysis, demonstrating the efficacy of PINNs as a viable and competitive alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving nonlinear differential equations, and discusses their broader applications across various scientific domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11406v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Channel Autoencoders for Wideband Communications leveraging Walsh-Hadamard interleaving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11407</link><description>arXiv:2601.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Qihe: A General-Purpose Static Analysis Framework for Verilog</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11408</link><description>arXiv:2601.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decades, static analysis has thrived in software, facilitating applications in bug detection, security, and program understanding. These advanced analyses are largely underpinned by general-purpose static analysis frameworks, which offer essential infrastructure to streamline their development. Conversely, hardware lacks such a framework, which overshadows the promising opportunities for sophisticated static analysis in hardware, hindering achievements akin to those witnessed in software. We thus introduce Qihe, the first general-purpose static analysis framework for Verilog -- a highly challenging endeavor given the absence of precedents in hardware. Qihe features an analysis-oriented front end, a Verilog-specific IR, and a suite of diverse fundamental analyses that capture essential hardware-specific characteristics -- such as bit-vector arithmetic, register synchronization, and digital component concurrency -- and enable the examination of intricate hardware data and control flows. These fundamental analyses are designed to support a wide array of hardware analysis clients. To validate Qihe's utility, we further developed a set of clients spanning bug detection, security, and program understanding. Our preliminary experimental results are highly promising; for example, Qihe uncovered 9 previously unknown bugs in popular real-world hardware projects (averaging 1.5K+ GitHub stars), all of which were confirmed by developers; moreover, Qihe successfully identified 18 bugs beyond the capabilities of existing static analyses for Verilog bug detection (i.e., linters), and detected 16 vulnerabilities in real-world hardware programs. By open-sourcing Qihe, which comprises over 100K lines of code, we aim to inspire further innovation and applications of sophisticated static analysis for hardware, aspiring to foster a similarly vibrant ecosystem that software analysis enjoys.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11408v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Topology-Guaranteed Image Segmentation: Enforcing Connectivity, Genus, and Width Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11409</link><description>arXiv:2601.11409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11409v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] New Adaptive Mechanism for Large Neighborhood Search using Dual Actor-Critic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11414</link><description>arXiv:2601.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11414v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sociotechnical Challenges of Machine Learning in Healthcare and Social Welfare</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11417</link><description>arXiv:2601.11417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sociotechnical challenges of machine learning in healthcare and social welfare are mismatches between how a machine learning tool functions and the structure of care practices. While prior research has documented many such issues, existing accounts often attribute them either to designers' limited social understanding or to inherent technical constraints, offering limited support for systematic description and comparison across settings. In this paper, we present a framework for conceptualizing sociotechnical challenges of machine learning grounded in qualitative fieldwork, a review of longitudinal deployment studies, and co-design workshops with healthcare and social welfare practitioners. The framework comprises (1) a categorization of eleven sociotechnical challenges organized along an ML-enabled care pathway, and (2) a process-oriented account of the conditions through which these challenges emerge across design and use. By providing a parsimonious vocabulary and an explanatory lens focused on practice, this work supports more precise analysis of how machine learning tools function and malfunction within real-world care delivery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11417v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Virtual Network Embedding polytope</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11419</link><description>arXiv:2601.11419v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Recently, with the rapid development of robot learning and imitation learning, numerous datasets and methods have emerged. However, these datasets and their task designs often lack systematic consideration and principles. This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models.

Abstract: We develop a learning-based framework for constructing shrinking disturbance-invariant tubes under state- and input-dependent uncertainty, intended as a building block for tube Model Predictive Control (MPC), and certify safety via a lifted, isotone (order-preserving) fixed-point map. Gaussian Process (GP) posteriors become $(1-\alpha)$ credible ellipsoids, then polytopic outer sets for deterministic set operations. A two-time-scale scheme separates learning epochs, where these polytopes are frozen, from an inner, outside-in iteration that converges to a compact fixed point $Z^\star\!\subseteq\!\mathcal G$; its state projection is RPI for the plant. As data accumulate, disturbance polytopes tighten, and the associated tubes nest monotonically, resolving the circular dependence between the set to be verified and the disturbance model while preserving hard constraints. A double-integrator study illustrates shrinking tube cross-sections in data-rich regions while maintaining invariance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11426v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Isotropy-Optimized Contrastive Learning for Semantic Course Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11427</link><description>arXiv:2601.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a semantic course recommendation system for students using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach built upon BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

To address this limitation, we propose a contrastive learning framework with data augmentation and isotropy regularization that produces more discriminative embeddings. Our system processes student text queries and recommends Top-N relevant courses from a curated dataset of over 500 engineering courses across multiple faculties. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model achieves improved embedding separation and more accurate course recommendations compared to vanilla BERT baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Forcing and Diagnosing Failure Modes of Fourier Neural Operators Across Diverse PDE Families</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11428</link><description>arXiv:2601.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Relational Linearity is a Predictor of Hallucinations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11429</link><description>arXiv:2601.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination is a central failure mode in large language models (LLMs). We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: "Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $\Delta\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11429v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The unreasonable effectiveness of pattern matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11432</link><description>arXiv:2601.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an astonishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to make sense of "Jabberwocky" language in which most or all content words have been randomly replaced by nonsense strings, e.g., translating "He dwushed a ghanc zawk" to "He dragged a spare chair". This result addresses ongoing controversies regarding how to best think of what LLMs are doing: are they a language mimic, a database, a blurry version of the Web? The ability of LLMs to recover meaning from structural patterns speaks to the unreasonable effectiveness of pattern-matching. Pattern-matching is not an alternative to "real" intelligence, but rather a key ingredient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11432v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440</link><description>arXiv:2601.11440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual Spread for Precise Massive Editing in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11441</link><description>arXiv:2601.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various domains, yet they face critical safety concerns. Model editing has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. Existing model editing methods often focus on optimizing an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. While effective, these approaches can be computationally expensive and may cause conflicts. In contrast, we shift our attention to Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual SprEad of the information matrix, which reduces noisy gradients and enables more stable edits from a different perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method HORSE through a clear theoretical comparison with several popular methods and extensive experiments conducted on two datasets across multiple LLMs. The results show that HORSE maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predict the Retrieval!

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing large language models' question-answering capabilities through the integration of external knowledge. However, when adapting RAG systems to specialized domains, challenges arise from distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we propose TTARAG, a test-time adaptation method that dynamically updates the language model's parameters during inference to improve RAG system performance in specialized domains. Our method introduces a simple yet effective approach where the model learns to predict retrieved content, enabling automatic parameter adjustment to the target domain. Through extensive experiments across six specialized domains, we demonstrate that TTARAG achieves substantial performance improvements over baseline RAG systems.

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11444v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IMS: Intelligent Hardware Monitoring System for Secure SoCs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11447</link><description>arXiv:2601.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modern Systems-on-Chip (SoC), the Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol exhibits security vulnerabilities, enabling partial or complete denial-of-service (DoS) through protocol-violation attacks. The recent countermeasures lack a dedicated real-time protocol semantic analysis and evade protocol compliance checks. This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with &lt;=3% latency overhead, and throughput of &gt;2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency. This demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight, security monitoring for resource-constrained edge environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11447v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PRISM-CAFO: Prior-conditioned Remote-sensing Infrastructure Segmentation and Mapping for CAFOs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11451</link><description>arXiv:2601.11451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (1) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria, (2) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier, and (3) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%.

Abstract: The shift from traditional synchronous generator (SG) based power generation to generation driven by power electronic devices introduces new dynamic phenomena and considerations for the control of large-scale power systems. In this paper, two aspects of all-inverter power systems are investigated: greater localization of system disturbance response and greater system controllability. The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system. This investigation utilizes reduced-order linear time-invariant models of both SGs and inverters that are shown to capture the frequency dynamics of interest in both all-SG and all-inverter systems, allowing for the efficient use of both frequency and time domain analysis methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11453v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Indoor Neutral-Host Networks Over Shared Spectrum and Shared Infrastructure: A Comparison Study of Real-World Deployments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11457</link><description>arXiv:2601.11457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor high-capacity connectivity is frequently constrained by significant building penetration loss and the inherent uplink power limitations of a typical outdoor macro-cell deployment. While Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) must optimize spectrum across low-band (&lt;1 GHz) and mid-band (1-7 GHz) frequencies, uplink performance remains disproportionately degraded due to link budget asymmetry. Neutral-host (NH) networking provides a scalable alternative by transparently offloading MNO subscribers via spectrum sharing and shared infrastructure. We present a multi-site measurement study comparing Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)-enabled NH networks against public MNO 4G/5G macro deployments and Wi-Fi. Our results show: (i) significant building penetration loss with up to 15.5 dB in low-bands and 17.9 dB in mid-bands, resulting in a ~10 dB RSRP deficit for MNO mid-bands compared to low-bands; (ii) NH networks provide a 30 dB higher median indoor RSRP with indoor NH normalized downlink throughput matches MNO outdoor performance, while its uplink performance exceeds MNO levels in both indoor and outdoor settings; (iii) NH proximity enables superior uplink efficiency, utilizing 64-QAM for 56% of transmissions (versus &lt;6% for MNOs) and reducing median UE transmit power by 5 dB; (iv) MNOs rely on low-band spectrum for indoor uplink transmissions, while the NH deployment maintains high-performance mid-band connectivity; and (v) NH outperforms MNOs in end-to-end throughput but trails Wi-Fi in uplink throughput and latency due to packet routing overhead to the MNO core.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11457v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interactive Narrative Analytics: Bridging Computational Narrative Extraction and Human Sensemaking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11459</link><description>arXiv:2601.11459v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11460v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MHA2MLA-VLM: Enabling DeepSeek's Economical Multi-Head Latent Attention across Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11464</link><description>arXiv:2601.11464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11464v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring LLM Features in Predictive Process Monitoring for Small-Scale Event-Logs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11468</link><description>arXiv:2601.11468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11468v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Low-Rank Key Value Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11471</link><description>arXiv:2601.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.
  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Scenario Rollouts for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11475</link><description>arXiv:2601.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11475v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Health Facility Location in Ethiopia: Leveraging LLMs to Integrate Expert Knowledge into Algorithmic Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11479</link><description>arXiv:2601.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tensor field tomography with attenuation and refraction: adjoint operators for the dynamic case and numerical experiments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11483</link><description>arXiv:2601.11483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with tensor field tomography in a fairly general setting, that takes refraction, attenuation and time-dependence of tensor fields into account. The mathematical model is given by attenuated ray transforms of the fields along geodesic curves corresponding to a Riemannian metric that is defined by the index of refraction. The data are given at the boundary tangent bundle of the domain and it is well-known that they can be characterized as boundary data of a transport equation turning tensor field tomography into an inverse source problem. This way the adjoint of the forward mapping can be computed using the integral representation or, equivalently, associated to a dual transport equation. The article offers and proves two different representations for the adjoint mappings both in the dynamic and static case. The numerical implementation is demonstrated and evaluated for static fields using the damped Landweber method with Nesterov acceleration applied to both, the integral and PDE-based formulations. The transport equations are solved using a viscosity approximation. The error analysis reveals that the integral representation significantly outperforms PDE-based methods in terms of computational efficiency while achieving comparable reconstruction accuracy. The impact of noise and deviations from straight-line trajectories are investigated confirming improved accuracy if refraction is taken into account. We conclude that the inclusion of refraction to the forward model pays in spite of increased numerical cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11483v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Space-Optimal, Computation-Optimal, Topology-Agnostic, Throughput-Scalable Causal Delivery through Hybrid Buffering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11487</link><description>arXiv:2601.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Message delivery respecting causal ordering (causal delivery) is one of the most classic and widely useful abstraction for inter-process communication in a distributed system. Most approaches tag messages with causality information and buffer them at the receiver until they can be safely delivered. Except for specific approaches that exploit communication topology, therefore not generally applicable, they incur a metadata overhead which is prohibitive for a large number of processes. Much less used are the approaches that enforce causal order by buffering messages at the sender, until it is safe to release them to the network, as the classic algorithm has too many drawbacks. In this paper, first we discuss the limitations of sender-only buffering approaches and introduce the Sender Permission to Send (SPS) enforcement strategy, showing that SPS + FIFO implies Causal. We analyze a recent sender-buffering algorithm, Cykas, which follows SPS + FIFO, albeit very conservatively, pointing out throughput scalability and liveness issues. Then, we introduce a novel SPS + FIFO based algorithm, which adopts a new hybrid approach: enforcing causality by combining sender-buffering to enforce SPS and receiver-buffering to enforce FIFO. The algorithm overcomes limitations of sender-only buffering, and achieves effectively constant metadata size per message. By a careful choice of data-structures, the algorithm is also computationally-optimal, with amortized effectively constant processing overhead. As far as we know, there is no other topology-agnostic causal delivery algorithm with these properties.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11487v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CTest-Metric: A Unified Framework to Assess Clinical Validity of Metrics for CT Report Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11488</link><description>arXiv:2601.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the generative AI era, where even critical medical tasks are increasingly automated, radiology report generation (RRG) continues to rely on suboptimal metrics for quality assessment. Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 "disagreement" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11488v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Extractive summarization on a CMOS Ising machine</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11491</link><description>arXiv:2601.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extractive summarization (ES) aims to generate a concise summary by selecting a subset of sentences from a document while maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11491v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BoxMind: Closed-loop AI strategy optimization for elite boxing validated in the 2024 Olympics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11492</link><description>arXiv:2601.11492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competitive sports require sophisticated tactical analysis, yet combat disciplines like boxing remain underdeveloped in AI-driven analytics due to the complexity of action dynamics and the lack of structured tactical representations. To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals. BoxMind establishes a replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging the gap between computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11492v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient error estimators for Generalized Nystr\"om</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11493</link><description>arXiv:2601.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms in numerical linear algebra have proven to be effective in ameliorating issues of scalability when working with large matrices, efficiently producing accurate low-rank approximations. A key remaining challenge, however, is to efficiently assess the approximation accuracy of randomized methods without additional expensive matrix accesses. Recent work has addressed this issue by deriving fast leave-one-out error estimators for the randomized SVD and Nystr\"om decomposition, enabling accurate error estimation with no additional matrix accesses. In this work, we extend the leave-one-out framework to the generalized Nystr\"om decomposition, an approach that can be applied to general rectangular matrices. We do this by deriving three new leave-one-out error estimators and validating their effectiveness through numerical experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11493v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Poisoned Apple Effect: Strategic Manipulation of Mediated Markets via Technology Expansion of AI Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11496</link><description>arXiv:2601.11496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of AI agents into economic markets fundamentally alters the landscape of strategic interaction. We investigate the economic implications of expanding the set of available technologies in three canonical game-theoretic settings: bargaining (resource division), negotiation (asymmetric information trade), and persuasion (strategic information transmission). We find that simply increasing the choice of AI delegates can drastically shift equilibrium payoffs and regulatory outcomes, often creating incentives for regulators to proactively develop and release technologies. Conversely, we identify a strategic phenomenon termed the "Poisoned Apple" effect: an agent may release a new technology, which neither they nor their opponent ultimately uses, solely to manipulate the regulator's choice of market design in their favor. This strategic release improves the releaser's welfare at the expense of their opponent and the regulator's fairness objectives. Our findings demonstrate that static regulatory frameworks are vulnerable to manipulation via technology expansion, necessitating dynamic market designs that adapt to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11496v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convergence Properties of Good Quantum Codes for Classical Communication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11498</link><description>arXiv:2601.11498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important part of the information theory folklore had been about the output statistics of codes that achieve the capacity and how the empirical distributions compare to the output distributions induced by the optimal input in the channel capacity problem. Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case. We also extend non-vanishing error probability results to the quantum case on block codes, by using the second-order converses for such codes based on hypercontractivity results for the quantum generalized depolarizing semi-groups.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11498v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Probability of First Success in Differential Evolution: Hazard Identities and Tail Bounds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11499</link><description>arXiv:2601.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study first-hitting times in Differential Evolution (DE) through a conditional hazard frame work. Instead of analyzing convergence via Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments, we ex press the survival probability of a measurable target set $A$ as a product of conditional first-hit probabilities (hazards) $p_t=\Prob(E_t\mid\mathcal F_{t-1})$. This yields distribution-free identities for survival and explicit tail bounds whenever deterministic lower bounds on the hazard hold on the survival event.
  For the L-SHADE algorithm with current-to-$p$best/1 mutation, we construct a checkable algorithmic witness event $\mathcal L_t$ under which the conditional hazard admits an explicit lower bound depending only on sampling rules, population size, and crossover statistics. This separates theoretical constants from empirical event frequencies and explains why worst-case constant-hazard bounds are typically conservative.
  We complement the theory with a Kaplan--Meier survival analysis on the CEC2017 benchmark suite . Across functions and budgets, we identify three distinct empirical regimes: (i) strongly clustered success, where hitting times concentrate in short bursts; (ii) approximately geometric tails, where a constant-hazard model is accurate; and (iii) intractable cases with no observed hits within the evaluation horizon. The results show that while constant-hazard bounds provide valid tail envelopes, the practical behavior of L-SHADE is governed by burst-like transitions rather than homogeneous per-generati on success probabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11499v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QUPID: A Partitioned Quantum Neural Network for Anomaly Detection in Smart Grid</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11500</link><description>arXiv:2601.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart grid infrastructures have revolutionized energy distribution, but their day-to-day operations require robust anomaly detection methods to counter risks associated with cyber-physical threats and system faults potentially caused by natural disasters, equipment malfunctions, and cyber attacks. Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Coding Schemes for the Noisy Torn Paper Channel</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11501</link><description>arXiv:2601.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make DNA a suitable medium for archival data storage, it is essential to consider the decay process of the strands observed in DNA storage systems. This paper studies the decay process as a probabilistic noisy torn paper channel (TPC), which first corrupts the bits of the transmitted sequence in a probabilistic manner by substitutions, then breaks the sequence into a set of noisy unordered substrings. The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels. Both approaches achieve reconstruction rates exceeding $99\%$ with no false decodings observed, primarily limited by computational resources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11501v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MetaboNet: The Largest Publicly Available Consolidated Dataset for Type 1 Diabetes Management</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11505</link><description>arXiv:2601.11505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Industry Influence in High-Profile Social Media Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11507</link><description>arXiv:2601.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To what extent is social media research independent from industry influence? Leveraging openly available data, we show that half of the research published in top journals has disclosable ties to industry in the form of prior funding, collaboration, or employment. However, the majority of these ties go undisclosed in the published research. These trends do not arise from broad scientific engagement with industry, but rather from a select group of scientists who maintain long-lasting relationships with industry. Undisclosed ties to industry are common not just among authors, but among reviewers and academic editors during manuscript evaluation. Further, industry-tied research garners more attention within the academy, among policymakers, on social media, and in the news. Finally, we find evidence that industry ties are associated with a topical focus away from impacts of platform-scale features. Together, these findings suggest industry influence in social media research is extensive, impactful, and often opaque. Going forward there is a need to strengthen disclosure norms and implement policies to ensure the visibility of independent research, and the integrity of industry supported research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11507v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReScene4D: Temporally Consistent Semantic Instance Segmentation of Evolving Indoor 3D Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11508</link><description>arXiv:2601.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11508v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Applying Formal Methods Tools to an Electronic Warfare Codebase (Experience report)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11510</link><description>arXiv:2601.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While using formal methods offers advantages over unit testing, their steep learning curve can be daunting to developers and can be a major impediment to widespread adoption. To support integration into an industrial software engineering workflow, a tool must provide useful information and must be usable with relatively minimal user effort. In this paper, we discuss our experiences associated with identifying and applying formal methods tools on an electronic warfare (EW) system with stringent safety requirements and present perspectives on formal methods tools from EW software engineers who are proficient in development yet lack formal methods training. In addition to a difference in mindset between formal methods and unit testing approaches, some formal methods tools use terminology or annotations that differ from their target programming language, creating another barrier to adoption. Input/output contracts, objects in memory affected by a function, and loop invariants can be difficult to grasp and use. In addition to usability, our findings include a comparison of vulnerabilities detected by different tools. Finally, we present suggestions for improving formal methods usability including better documentation of capabilities, decreased manual effort, and improved handling of library code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11510v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Capacity Constraints Make Admissions Processes Less Predictable</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11513</link><description>arXiv:2601.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often used to make predictions about admissions process outcomes, such as for colleges or jobs. However, such decision processes differ substantially from the conventional machine learning paradigm. Because admissions decisions are capacity-constrained, whether a student is admitted depends on the other applicants who apply. We show how this dependence affects predictive performance even in otherwise ideal settings. Theoretically, we introduce two concepts that characterize the relationship between admission function properties, machine learning representation, and generalization to applicant pool distribution shifts: instability, which measures how many existing decisions can change when a single new applicant is introduced; and variability, which measures the number of unique students whose decisions can change. Empirically, we illustrate our theory on individual-level admissions data from the New York City high school matching system, showing that machine learning performance degrades as the applicant pool increasingly differs from the training data. Furthermore, there are larger performance drops for schools using decision rules that are more unstable and variable. Our work raises questions about the reliability of predicting individual admissions probabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11513v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ShapeR: Robust Conditional 3D Shape Generation from Casual Captures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11514</link><description>arXiv:2601.11514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11514v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Building Production-Ready Probes For Gemini</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11516</link><description>arXiv:2601.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier language model capabilities are improving rapidly. We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.
  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.
  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do explanations generalize across large reasoning models?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11517</link><description>arXiv:2601.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) produce a textual chain of thought (CoT) in the process of solving a problem, which serves as a potentially powerful tool to understand the problem by surfacing a human-readable, natural-language explanation. However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency. Taken together, these results prescribe caution when using LRM explanations to yield new insights and outline a framework for characterizing LRM explanation generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Long Is a Piece of String?

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11518v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Empirical Coordination over Markov Channel with Independent Source</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11520</link><description>arXiv:2601.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study joint source-channel coding over Markov channels through the empirical coordination framework. More specifically, we aim at determining the empirical distributions of source and channel symbols that can be induced by a coding scheme. We consider strictly causal encoders that generate channel inputs, without access to the past channel states, henceforth driving the current Markov state evolution. Our main result is the single-letter inner and outer bounds of the set of achievable joint distributions, coordinating all the symbols in the network. To establish the inner bound, we introduce a new notion of typicality, the input-driven Markov typicality, and develop its fundamental properties. Contrary to the classical block-Markov coding schemes that rely on blockwise independence for discrete memoryless channels, our analysis directly exploits the Markov channel structure and improves beyond the independence-based arguments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11520v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniX: Unifying Autoregression and Diffusion for Chest X-Ray Understanding and Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11522</link><description>arXiv:2601.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

Abstract: We study the allocation of indivisible items that form an undirected graph and investigate the worst-case welfare loss when requiring that each agent must receive a connected subgraph. Our focus is on both egalitarian and utilitarian welfare. Specifically, we introduce the concept of egalitarian (resp., utilitarian) price of connectivity, which captures the worst-case ratio between the optimal egalitarian (resp., utilitarian) welfare among all allocations and that among connected allocations. We provide tight or asymptotically tight bounds on the price of connectivity for several large classes of graphs in the case of two agents -- including graphs with vertex connectivity $1$ or $2$ and complete bipartite graphs -- as well as for paths, stars, and cycles in the general case where the number of agents can be arbitrary.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.03467v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative AI Purpose-built for Social and Mental Health: A Real-World Pilot</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11689</link><description>arXiv:2511.11689v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) chatbots built for mental health could deliver safe, personalized, and scalable mental health support. We evaluate a foundation model designed for mental health. Adults completed mental health measures while engaging with the chatbot between May 15, 2025 and September 15, 2025. Users completed an opt-in consent, demographic information, mental health symptoms, social connection, and self-identified goals. Measures were repeated every two weeks up to 6 weeks, and a final follow-up at 10 weeks. Analyses included effect sizes, and growth mixture models to identify participant groups and their characteristic engagement, severity, and demographic factors. Users demonstrated significant reductions in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 that were sustained at follow-up. Significant improvements in Hope, Behavioral Activation, Social Interaction, Loneliness, and Perceived Social Support were observed throughout and maintained at 10 week follow-up. Engagement was high and predicted outcomes. Working alliance was comparable to traditional care and predicted outcomes. Automated safety guardrails functioned as designed, with 76 sessions flagged for risk and all handled according to escalation policies. This single arm naturalistic observational study provides initial evidence that a GAI foundation model for mental health can deliver accessible, engaging, effective, and safe mental health support. These results lend support to findings from early randomized designs and offer promise for future study of mental health GAI in real world settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11689v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Drivers' Drowsiness Detection and Analysis through Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12438</link><description>arXiv:2511.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long road trip is fun for drivers. However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness. Our proposed and implemented DCNNs embedded drowsiness detection model successfully react with NTHU-DDD dataset and Yawn-Eye-Dataset with drowsiness detection classification accuracy of 99.6% and 97% respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EvidFuse: Writing-Time Evidence Learning for Consistent Text-Chart Data Reporting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05487</link><description>arXiv:2601.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven reports communicate decision-relevant insights by tightly interleaving narrative text with charts grounded in underlying tables. However, current LLM-based systems typically generate narratives and visualizations in staged pipelines, following either a text-first-graph-second or a graph-first-text-second paradigm. These designs often lead to chart-text inconsistency and insight freezing, where the intermediate evidence space becomes fixed and the model can no longer retrieve or construct new visual evidence as the narrative evolves, resulting in shallow and predefined analysis. To address the limitations, we propose \textbf{EvidFuse}, a training-free multi-agent framework that enables writing-time text-chart interleaved generation for data-driven reports. EvidFuse decouples visualization analysis from long-form drafting via two collaborating components: a \textbf{Data-Augmented Analysis Agent}, equipped with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-derived knowledge and access to raw tables, and a \textbf{Real-Time Evidence Construction Writer} that plans an outline and drafts the report while intermittently issuing fine-grained analysis requests. This design allows visual evidence to be constructed and incorporated exactly when the narrative requires it, directly constraining subsequent claims and enabling on-demand expansion of the evidence space. Experiments demonstrate that EvidFuse attains the top rank in both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations on chart quality, chart-text alignment, and report-level usefulness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05487v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MPCI-Bench: A Benchmark for Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity Evaluation of Language Model Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08235</link><description>arXiv:2601.08235v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As language-model agents evolve from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that handle personal data, evaluating their adherence to social norms becomes increasingly critical, often through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). However, existing CI benchmarks are largely text-centric and primarily emphasize negative refusal scenarios, overlooking multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information. We will open-source MPCI-Bench to facilitate future research on agentic CI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08235v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DSA-Tokenizer: Disentangled Semantic-Acoustic Tokenization via Flow Matching-based Hierarchical Fusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09239</link><description>arXiv:2601.09239v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech tokenizers serve as the cornerstone of discrete Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). Existing tokenizers either prioritize semantic encoding, fuse semantic content with acoustic style inseparably, or achieve incomplete semantic-acoustic disentanglement. To achieve better disentanglement, we propose DSA-Tokenizer, which explicitly disentangles speech into discrete semantic and acoustic tokens via distinct optimization constraints. Specifically, semantic tokens are supervised by ASR to capture linguistic content, while acoustic tokens focus on mel-spectrograms restoration to encode style. To eliminate rigid length constraints between the two sequences, we introduce a hierarchical Flow-Matching decoder that further improve speech generation quality. Furthermore, We employ a joint reconstruction-recombination training strategy to enforce this separation. DSA-Tokenizer enables high fidelity reconstruction and flexible recombination through robust disentanglement, facilitating controllable generation in speech LLMs. Our analysis highlights disentangled tokenization as a pivotal paradigm for future speech modeling. Audio samples are avaialble at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/DSA_Tokenizer_demo/.

Abstract: Most Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems require dividing airtime across their two modes. However, the specific impact of this decision on sensing performance remains unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we therefore investigate the impact on a gesture recognition system using a Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) ISAC system. With our dataset of power per beam pair gathered with two mmWave devices performing constant beam sweeps while test subjects performed distinct gestures, we train a gesture classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. We then subsample these measurements, emulating reduced sensing airtime, showing that a sensing airtime of 25 % only reduces classification accuracy by 0.15 percentage points from full-time sensing. Alongside this high-quality sensing at low airtime, mmWave systems are known to provide extremely high data throughputs, making mmWave ISAC a prime enabler for applications such as truly wireless Extended Reality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10733v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SSC-UNet: UNet with Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Phonocardiography Noise Reduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10735</link><description>arXiv:2601.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) remains a significant global health concern affecting approximately 1\% of births worldwide. Phonocardiography has emerged as a supplementary tool to diagnose CHD cost-effectively. However, the performance of these diagnostic models highly depends on the quality of the phonocardiography, thus, noise reduction is particularly critical. Supervised UNet effectively improves noise reduction capabilities, but limited clean data hinders its application. The complex time-frequency characteristics of phonocardiography further complicate finding the balance between effectively removing noise and preserving pathological features. In this study, we proposed a self-supervised phonocardiography noise reduction model based on Noise2Noise to enable training without clean data. Augmentation and contrastive learning are applied to enhance its performance. We obtained an average SNR of 12.98 dB after filtering under 10~dB of hospital noise. Classification sensitivity after filtering was improved from 27\% to 88\%, indicating its promising pathological feature retention capabilities in practical noisy environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differentiating through binarized topology changes: Second-order subpixel-smoothed projection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10737</link><description>arXiv:2601.10737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in topology optimization (TopOpt) is that manufacturable structures, being inherently binary, are non-differentiable, creating a fundamental tension with gradient-based optimization. The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10737v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UBiGTLoc: A Unified BiLSTM-Graph Transformer Localization Framework for IoT Sensor Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10743</link><description>arXiv:2601.10743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor nodes localization in wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks is crucial for the effective operation of diverse applications, such as smart cities and smart agriculture. Existing sensor nodes localization approaches heavily rely on anchor nodes within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Anchor nodes are sensor nodes equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers and thus, have known locations. These anchor nodes operate as references to localize other sensor nodes. However, the presence of anchor nodes may not always be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Additionally, localization accuracy can be compromised by fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs while relying solely on cost-effective RSSI data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sensor Placement for Urban Traffic Interpolation: A Data-Driven Evaluation to Inform Policy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10747</link><description>arXiv:2601.10747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data on citywide street-segment traffic volumes are essential for urban planning and sustainable mobility management. Yet such data are available only for a limited subset of streets due to the high costs of sensor deployment and maintenance. Traffic volumes on the remaining network are therefore interpolated based on existing sensor measurements. However, current sensor locations are often determined by administrative priorities rather than by data-driven optimization, leading to biased coverage and reduced estimation performance. This study provides a large-scale, real-world benchmarking of easily implementable, data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of permanent and temporary traffic sensors, using segment-level data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts). It compares spatial placement strategies based on network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, and active learning. In addition, the study examines temporal deployment schemes for temporary sensors. The findings highlight that spatial placement strategies that emphasize even spatial coverage and employ active learning achieve the lowest prediction errors. With only 10 sensors, they reduce the mean absolute error by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan compared to alternatives. Temporal deployment choices further improve performance: distributing measurements evenly across weekdays reduces error by an additional 7% in Berlin and 21% in Manhattan. Together, these spatial and temporal principles allow temporary deployments to closely approximate the performance of optimally placed permanent deployments. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that cities can substantially improve data usefulness by adopting data-driven sensor placement strategies, while retaining flexibility in choosing between temporary and permanent deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AnyECG: Evolved ECG Foundation Model for Holistic Health Profiling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10748</link><description>arXiv:2601.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) has demonstrated the ability to detect diverse pathologies, but most existing models focus on single disease identification, neglecting comorbidities and future risk prediction. Although ECGFounder expanded cardiac disease coverage, a holistic health profiling model remains needed.
  Methods: We constructed a large multicenter dataset comprising 13.3 million ECGs from 2.98 million patients. Using transfer learning, ECGFounder was fine-tuned to develop AnyECG, a foundation model for holistic health profiling. Performance was evaluated using external validation cohorts and a 10-year longitudinal cohort for current diagnosis, future risk prediction, and comorbidity identification.
  Results: AnyECG demonstrated systemic predictive capability across 1172 conditions, achieving an AUROC greater than 0.7 for 306 diseases. The model revealed novel disease associations, robust comorbidity patterns, and future disease risks. Representative examples included high diagnostic performance for hyperparathyroidism (AUROC 0.941), type 2 diabetes (0.803), Crohn disease (0.817), lymphoid leukemia (0.856), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.773).
  Conclusion: The AnyECG foundation model provides substantial evidence that AI-ECG can serve as a systemic tool for concurrent disease detection and long-term risk prediction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10748v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive algorithm for microsensor in sustainable environmental monitoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10780</link><description>arXiv:2601.10780v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: We propose a methodology to infer collision operators from phase space data of plasma dynamics. Our approach combines a differentiable kinetic simulator, whose core component in this work is a differentiable Fokker-Planck solver, with a gradient-based optimisation method to learn the collisional operators that best describe the phase space dynamics. We test our method using data from two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations of spatially uniform thermal plasmas, and learn the collision operator that captures the self-consistent electromagnetic interaction between finite-size charged particles over a wide variety of simulation parameters. We demonstrate that the learned operators are more accurate than alternative estimates based on particle tracks, while making no prior assumptions about the relevant time-scales of the processes and significantly reducing memory requirements. We find that the retrieved operators, obtained in the non-relativistic regime, are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions derived for electrostatic scenarios. Our results show that differentiable simulators offer a powerful and computational efficient approach to infer novel operators for a wide rage of problems, such as electromagnetically dominated collisional dynamics and stochastic wave-particle interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10885v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On spectral interference of the short-time Fourier transform and its nonlinear variations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10910</link><description>arXiv:2601.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral interference, the frequency counterpart of the beating phenomenon in the time domain, can severely distort time-frequency representations (TFRs) in physical applications. We study this phenomenon for the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a Gaussian window and for nonlinear refinements based on the reassignment method, with an emphasis on the synchrosqueezing transform (SST). Working with a two-component harmonic model, we quantify when STFT can (and cannot) resolve two nearby frequencies: a sharp transition occurs at a critical gap that scales inversely to kernel bandwidth and depends explicitly on the amplitude ratio. Below this threshold, the spectrogram ridges undergo bifurcation and form repeating time-frequency bubbles, which we describe asymptotically and, in the balanced-amplitude case, approximate closely by ellipses. We then analyze the STFT phase, showing a canonical winding behavior, and relate the complex-valued SST reassignment map to a holomorphic structure via the Bargmann transform. In the two-component setting the reassignment rule admits an explicit Mobius-geometry description, sending frequency lines to circular arcs in the complex plane. Finally, viewing SST and reassignment through a measure mapping perspective, we derive small-kernel asymptotics that explain when reassignment sharpens energy and when it produces distorted or misleading TFRs; we also introduce a generalized synchrosqueezing framework that isolates the role of STFT weighting and clarifies how alternative choices can mitigate interference in certain regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10910v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Specular differentiation in normed vector spaces and its application to nonsmooth convex optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10950</link><description>arXiv:2601.10950v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: This study investigates the detection and classification of depressive and non-depressive states using deep learning approaches. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that substantially affects quality of life, and early diagnosis can greatly enhance treatment effectiveness and patient care. However, conventional diagnostic methods rely heavily on self-reported assessments, which are often subjective and may lack reliability. Consequently, there is a strong need for objective and accurate techniques to identify depressive states. In this work, a deep learning based framework is proposed for the early detection of depression using EEG signals. EEG data, which capture underlying brain activity and are not influenced by external behavioral factors, can reveal subtle neural changes associated with depression. The proposed approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to jointly extract spatial and temporal features from EEG recordings. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm is then applied to select the most informative features, followed by classification using a fully connected neural network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high performance in accurately identifying depressive states, with an overall accuracy of 98.74%. By effectively integrating temporal and spatial information and employing optimized feature selection, this method shows strong potential as a reliable tool for clinical applications. Overall, the proposed framework not only enables accurate early detection of depression but also has the potential to support improved treatment strategies and patient outcomes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stabilizer Code-Generic Universal Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10964</link><description>arXiv:2601.10964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10964v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Memorize Early, Then Query: Inlier-Memorization-Guided Active Outlier Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10993</link><description>arXiv:2601.10993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) aims to identify abnormal instances, known as outliers or anomalies, by learning typical patterns of normal data, or inliers. Performing OD under an unsupervised regime-without any information about anomalous instances in the training data-is challenging. A recently observed phenomenon, known as the inlier-memorization (IM) effect, where deep generative models (DGMs) tend to memorize inlier patterns during early training, provides a promising signal for distinguishing outliers. However, existing unsupervised approaches that rely solely on the IM effect still struggle when inliers and outliers are not well-separated or when outliers form dense clusters. To address these limitations, we incorporate active learning to selectively acquire informative labels, and propose IMBoost, a novel framework that explicitly reinforces the IM effect to improve outlier detection. Our method consists of two stages: 1) a warm-up phase that induces and promotes the IM effect, and 2) a polarization phase in which actively queried samples are used to maximize the discrepancy between inlier and outlier scores. In particular, we propose a novel query strategy and tailored loss function in the polarization phase to effectively identify informative samples and fully leverage the limited labeling budget. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the IMBoost consistently decreases inlier risk while increasing outlier risk throughout training, thereby amplifying their separation. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that IMBoost not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art active OD methods but also requires substantially less computational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10993v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contextual Distributionally Robust Optimization with Causal and Continuous Structure: An Interpretable and Tractable Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11016</link><description>arXiv:2601.11016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a framework for contextual distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that considers the causal and continuous structure of the underlying distribution by developing interpretable and tractable decision rules that prescribe decisions using covariates. We first introduce the causal Sinkhorn discrepancy (CSD), an entropy-regularized causal Wasserstein distance that encourages continuous transport plans while preserving the causal consistency. We then formulate a contextual DRO model with a CSD-based ambiguity set, termed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO), and derive its strong dual reformulation where the worst-case distribution is characterized as a mixture of Gibbs distributions. To solve the corresponding infinite-dimensional policy optimization, we propose the Soft Regression Forest (SRF) decision rule, which approximates optimal policies within arbitrary measurable function spaces. The SRF preserves the interpretability of classical decision trees while being fully parametric, differentiable, and Lipschitz smooth, enabling intrinsic interpretation from both global and local perspectives. To solve the Causal-SDRO with parametric decision rules, we develop an efficient stochastic compositional gradient algorithm that converges to an $\varepsilon$-stationary point at a rate of $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$, matching the convergence rate of standard stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we validate our method through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11016v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KOCOBrain: Kuramoto-Guided Graph Network for Uncovering Structure-Function Coupling in Adolescent Prenatal Drug Exposure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11018</link><description>arXiv:2601.11018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exposure to psychoactive substances during pregnancy, such as cannabis, can disrupt neurodevelopment and alter large-scale brain networks, yet identifying their neural signatures remains challenging. We introduced KOCOBrain: KuramotO COupled Brain Graph Network; a unified graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional connectomes via Kuramoto-based phase dynamics and cognition-aware attention. The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario. Applied to the ABCD cohort, KOCOBrain improved prenatal drug exposure prediction over relevant baselines and revealed interpretable structure-function patterns that reflect disrupted brain network coordination associated with early exposure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convolutions Need Registers Too: HVS-Inspired Dynamic Attention for Video Quality Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11045</link><description>arXiv:2601.11045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) estimates perceptual quality without a reference video, which is often challenging. While recent techniques leverage saliency or transformer attention, they merely address global context of the video signal by using static maps as auxiliary inputs rather than embedding context fundamentally within feature extraction of the video sequence. We present Dynamic Attention with Global Registers for Video Quality Assessment (DAGR-VQA), the first framework integrating register-token directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal, dynamic saliency prediction. By embedding learnable register tokens as global context carriers, our model enables dynamic, HVS-inspired attention, producing temporally adaptive saliency maps that track salient regions over time without explicit motion estimation. Our model integrates dynamic saliency maps with RGB inputs, capturing spatial data and analyzing it through a temporal transformer to deliver a perceptually consistent video quality assessment. Comprehensive tests conducted on the LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC datasets show that the performance is highly competitive, surpassing the majority of top baselines. Research on ablation studies demonstrates that the integration of register tokens promotes the development of stable and temporally consistent attention mechanisms. Achieving an efficiency of 387.7 FPS at 1080p, DAGR-VQA demonstrates computational performance suitable for real-time applications like multimedia streaming systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11045v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Visual question answering-based image-finding generation for pulmonary nodules on chest CT from structured annotations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11075</link><description>arXiv:2601.11075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretation of imaging findings based on morphological characteristics is important for diagnosing pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) images. In this study, we constructed a visual question answering (VQA) dataset from structured data in an open dataset and investigated an image-finding generation method for chest CT images, with the aim of enabling interactive diagnostic support that presents findings based on questions that reflect physicians' interests rather than fixed descriptions. In this study, chest CT images included in the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) datasets were used. Regions of interest surrounding the pulmonary nodules were extracted from these images, and image findings and questions were defined based on morphological characteristics recorded in the database. A dataset comprising pairs of cropped images, corresponding questions, and image findings was constructed, and the VQA model was fine-tuned on it. Language evaluation metrics such as BLEU were used to evaluate the generated image findings. The VQA dataset constructed using the proposed method contained image findings with natural expressions as radiological descriptions. In addition, the generated image findings showed a high CIDEr score of 3.896, and a high agreement with the reference findings was obtained through evaluation based on morphological characteristics. We constructed a VQA dataset for chest CT images using structured information on the morphological characteristics from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Methods for generating image findings in response to these questions have also been investigated. Based on the generated results and evaluation metric scores, the proposed method was effective as an interactive diagnostic support system that can present image findings according to physicians' interests.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11075v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generation of Chest CT pulmonary Nodule Images by Latent Diffusion Models using the LIDC-IDRI Dataset</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11085</link><description>arXiv:2601.11085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed to support diagnosis, but their performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to collect the large amount of CT images for specific cases, such as small cell carcinoma with low epidemiological incidence or benign tumors that are difficult to distinguish from malignant ones. This leads to the challenge of data imbalance. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a method to automatically generate chest CT nodule images that capture target features using latent diffusion models (LDM) and verified its effectiveness. Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we created pairs of nodule images and finding-based text prompts based on physician evaluations. For the image generation models, we used Stable Diffusion version 1.5 (SDv1) and 2.0 (SDv2), which are types of LDM. Each model was fine-tuned using the created dataset. During the generation process, we adjusted the guidance scale (GS), which indicates the fidelity to the input text. Both quantitative and subjective evaluations showed that SDv2 (GS = 5) achieved the best performance in terms of image quality, diversity, and text consistency. In the subjective evaluation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the generated images and real images, confirming that the quality was equivalent to real clinical images. We proposed a method for generating chest CT nodule images based on input text using LDM. Evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high-quality images that successfully capture specific medical features.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Split-and-Conquer: Distributed Factor Modeling for High-Dimensional Matrix-Variate Time Series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11091</link><description>arXiv:2601.11091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional, large-scale, heterogeneous matrix-variate time series data using a factor model. The data are first partitioned column-wise (or row-wise) and allocated to node servers, where each node estimates the row (or column) loading matrix via two-dimensional tensor PCA. These local estimates are then transmitted to a central server and aggregated, followed by a final PCA step to obtain the global row (or column) loading matrix estimator. Given the estimated loading matrices, the corresponding factor matrices are subsequently computed. Unlike existing distributed approaches, our framework preserves the latent matrix structure, thereby improving computational efficiency and enhancing information utilization. We also discuss row- and column-wise clustering procedures for settings in which the group memberships are unknown. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to unit-root nonstationary matrix-variate time series. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are derived for the diverging dimension of the data in each computing unit and the sample size $T$. Simulation results assess the computational efficiency and estimation accuracy of the proposed framework, and real data applications further validate its predictive performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KANHedge: Efficient Hedging of High-Dimensional Options Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based BSDE Solver</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11097</link><description>arXiv:2601.11097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional option pricing and hedging present significant challenges in quantitative finance, where traditional PDE-based methods struggle with the curse of dimensionality. The BSDE framework offers a computationally efficient alternative to PDE-based methods, and recently proposed deep BSDE solvers, generally utilizing conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), build upon this framework to provide a scalable alternative to numerical BSDE solvers. In this research, we show that although such MLP-based deep BSDEs demonstrate promising results in option pricing, there remains room for improvement regarding hedging performance. To address this issue, we introduce KANHedge, a novel BSDE-based hedger that leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within the BSDE framework. Unlike conventional MLP approaches that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable B-spline activation functions that provide enhanced function approximation capabilities for continuous derivatives. We comprehensively evaluate KANHedge on both European and American basket options across multiple dimensions and market conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while KANHedge and MLP achieve comparable pricing accuracy, KANHedge provides improved hedging performance. Specifically, KANHedge achieves considerable reductions in hedging cost metrics, demonstrating enhanced risk control capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simple Models, Rich Representations: Visual Decoding from Primate Intracortical Neural Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11108</link><description>arXiv:2601.11108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural activity gives rise to perception is a central challenge in neuroscience. We address the problem of decoding visual information from high-density intracortical recordings in primates, using the THINGS Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset. We systematically evaluate the effects of model architecture, training objectives, and data scaling on decoding performance. Results show that decoding accuracy is mainly driven by modeling temporal dynamics in neural signals, rather than architectural complexity. A simple model combining temporal attention with a shallow MLP achieves up to 70% top-1 image retrieval accuracy, outperforming linear baselines as well as recurrent and convolutional approaches. Scaling analyses reveal predictable diminishing returns with increasing input dimensionality and dataset size. Building on these findings, we design a modular generative decoding pipeline that combines low-resolution latent reconstruction with semantically conditioned diffusion, generating plausible images from 200 ms of brain activity. This framework provides principles for brain-computer interfaces and semantic neural decoding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11108v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bond Polytope under Vertex- and Edge-sums</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11119</link><description>arXiv:2601.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cut in a graph $G$ is called a {\em bond} if both parts of the cut induce connected subgraphs in $G$, and the {\em bond polytope} is the convex hull of all bonds. Computing the maximum weight bond is an NP-hard problem even for planar graphs. However, the problem is solvable in linear time on $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, and in more general, on graphs of bounded treewidth, essentially due to clique-sum decomposition into simpler graphs.
  We show how to obtain the bond polytope of graphs that are $1$- or $2$-sum of graphs $G_1$ and $ G_2$ from the bond polytopes of $G_1,G_2$. Using this we show that the extension complexity of the bond polytope of $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs is linear. Prior to this work, a linear size description of the bond polytope was known only for $3$-connected planar $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, essentially only for wheel graphs.
  We also describe an elementary linear time algorithm for the \MaxBond problem on $(K_5\setminus e)$-minor-free graphs. Prior to this work, a linear time algorithm in this setting was known. However, the hidden constant in the big-Oh notation was large because the algorithm relies on the heavy machinery of linear time algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth, used as a black box.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11119v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Artificial Intelligence and the US Economy: An Accounting Perspective on Investment and Production</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11196</link><description>arXiv:2601.11196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has moved to the center of policy, market, and academic debates, but its macroeconomic footprint is still only partly understood. This paper provides an overview on how the current AI wave is captured in US national accounts, combining a simple macro-accounting framework with a stylized description of the AI production process. We highlight the crucial role played by data centers, which constitute the backbone of the AI ecosystem and have attracted formidable investment in 2025, as they are indispensable for meeting the rapidly increasing worldwide demand for AI services. We document that the boom in IT and AI-related capital expenditure in the first three quarters of the year has given an outsized boost to aggregate demand, while its contribution to GDP growth is smaller once the high import content of AI hardware is netted out. Furthermore, simple calculations suggest that, at current utilization rates and pricing, the production of services originating in new AI data centers could contribute to GDP over the turn of the next quarters on a scale comparable to that of investment spending to date. Short reinvestment cycles and uncertainty about future AI demand, while not currently acting as a macroeconomic drag, can nevertheless fuel macroeconomic risks over the medium term.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Model-free policy gradient for discrete-time mean-field control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11217</link><description>arXiv:2601.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study model-free policy learning for discrete-time mean-field control (MFC) problems with finite state space and compact action space. In contrast to the extensive literature on value-based methods for MFC, policy-based approaches remain largely unexplored due to the intrinsic dependence of transition kernels and rewards on the evolving population state distribution, which prevents the direct use of likelihood-ratio estimators of policy gradients from classical single-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error. Numerical experiments on representative mean-field control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11217v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-Shot Detection of Elastic Transient Morphology Across Physical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11415</link><description>arXiv:2601.11415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test whether a representation learned from interferometric strain transients in gravitational-wave observatories can act as a frozen morphology-sensitive operator for unseen sensors, provided the target signals preserve coherent elastic transient structure. Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels.
  On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer.
  Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Statistical Robustness of Interval CVaR Based Regression Models under Perturbation and Contamination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11420</link><description>arXiv:2601.11420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness under perturbation and contamination is a prominent issue in statistical learning. We address the robust nonlinear regression based on the so-called interval conditional value-at-risk (In-CVaR), which is introduced to enhance robustness by trimming extreme losses. While recent literature shows that the In-CVaR based statistical learning exhibits superior robustness performance than classical robust regression models, its theoretical robustness analysis for nonlinear regression remains largely unexplored. We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and Huber losses. Moreover, we analyze the qualitative robustness of the In-CVaR based estimator under perturbation. We show that under several minor assumptions, the In-CVaR based estimator is qualitatively robust in terms of the Prokhorov metric if and only if the largest portion of losses is trimmed. Overall, this study analyzes robustness properties of In-CVaR based nonlinear regression models under both perturbation and contamination, which illustrates the advantages of In-CVaR risk measure over conditional value-at-risk and expectation for robust regression in both theory and numerical experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Near-Optimal Decentralized Stochastic Nonconvex Optimization with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11435</link><description>arXiv:2601.11435v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for future gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, enabling beamforming with greatly reduced hardware and computational cost. However, channel estimation for MiLAC-aided systems remains an open problem. Conventional least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation rely on intensive digital computation, which undermines the benefits offered by MiLACs. In this letter, we propose efficient LS and MMSE channel estimation schemes for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. By designing training precoders and combiners implemented by MiLACs, both LS and MMSE estimation are performed fully in the analog domain, achieving identical performance to their digital counterparts while significantly reducing computational complexity, transmit RF chains, analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) resolution requirements, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Numerical results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed schemes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smooth SCAD: A Raised Cosine SCAD Type Thresholding Rule for Wavelet Denoising</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11461</link><description>arXiv:2601.11461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a smooth variant of the SCAD thresholding rule for wavelet denoising by replacing its piecewise linear transition with a raised cosine. The resulting shrinkage function is odd, continuous on R, and continuously differentiable away from the main threshold, yet retains the hallmark SCAD properties of sparsity for small coefficients and near unbiasedness for large ones. This smoothness places the rule within the continuous thresholding class for which Stein's unbiased risk estimate is valid. As a result, unbiased risk computation, stable data-driven threshold selection, and the asymptotic theory of Kudryavtsev and Shestakov apply.
  A corresponding nonconvex prior is obtained whose posterior mode coincides with the estimator, yielding a transparent Bayesian interpretation. We give an explicit SURE risk expression, discuss the oracle scale of the optimal threshold, and describe both global and level-dependent adaptive versions. The smooth SCAD rule therefore offers a tractable refinement of SCAD, combining low bias, exact sparsity, and analytical convenience in a single wavelet shrinkage procedure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11461v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Probabilistic Approach to Trajectory-Based Optimal Experimental Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11473</link><description>arXiv:2601.11473v1 Announce Type: cross

In this approach a discrete path optimization problem is defined on a static navigation mesh, and trajectories are modeled as random variables governed by a parametric Markov policy. The discrete path optimization problem is then replaced with an equivalent stochastic optimization problem over the policy parameters, resulting in an optimal probability model that samples estimates of the optimal discrete path. This approach enables exploration of the utility function's distribution tail and treats the utility function of the design as a black box, making it applicable to linear and nonlinear inverse problems and beyond experimental design. Numerical verification and analysis are carried out by using a parameter identification problem widely used in model-based optimal experimental design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11473v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EqVIO: An Equivariant Filter for Visual Inertial Odometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01980</link><description>arXiv:2205.01980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is the problem of estimating a robot's trajectory by combining information from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera, and is of great interest to the robotics community. This paper develops a novel Lie group symmetry for the VIO problem and applies the recently proposed equivariant filter. The proposed symmetry is compatible with the invariance of the VIO reference frame, leading to improved filter consistency. The bias-free IMU dynamics are group-affine, ensuring that filter linearisation errors depend only on the bias estimation error and measurement noise. Furthermore, visual measurements are equivariant with respect to the symmetry, enabling the application of the higher-order equivariant output approximation to reduce approximation error in the filter update equation. As a result, the equivariant filter (EqF) based on this Lie group is a consistent estimator for VIO with lower linearisation error in the propagation of state dynamics and a higher order equivariant output approximation than standard formulations. Experimental results on the popular EuRoC and UZH FPV datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms other state-of-the-art VIO algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2205.01980v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constructive Equivariant Observer Design for Inertial Velocity-Aided Attitude</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03564</link><description>arXiv:2209.03564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial Velocity-Aided Attitude (VAA), the estimation of the velocity and attitude of a vehicle using gyroscope, accelerometer, and inertial-frame velocity (e.g. GPS velocity) measurements, is an important problem in the control of Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems (RPAS). Existing solutions provide limited stability guarantees, relying on local linearisation, high gain design, or assuming specific trajectories such as constant acceleration of the vehicle. This paper proposes a novel non-linear observer for inertial VAA with almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable error dynamics. The approach exploits Lie group symmetries of the system dynamics to construct a globally valid correction term. To the authors' knowledge, this construction is the first observer to provide almost global convergence for the inertial VAA problem. The observer performance is verified in simulation, where it is shown that the estimation error converges to zero even with an extremely poor initial condition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2209.03564v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Simple Unified Uncertainty-Guided Framework for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07541</link><description>arXiv:2306.07541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to learning an agent fully relying on a data-driven paradigm. However, constrained by the limited quality of the offline dataset, its performance is often sub-optimal. Therefore, it is desired to further finetune the agent via extra online interactions before deployment. Unfortunately, offline-to-online RL can be challenging due to two main challenges: constrained exploratory behavior and state-action distribution shift. In view of this, we propose a Simple Unified uNcertainty-Guided (SUNG) framework, which naturally unifies the solution to both challenges with the tool of uncertainty. Specifically, SUNG quantifies uncertainty via a VAE-based state-action visitation density estimator. To facilitate efficient exploration, SUNG presents a practical optimistic exploration strategy to select informative actions with both high value and high uncertainty. Moreover, SUNG develops an adaptive exploitation method by applying conservative offline RL objectives to high-uncertainty samples and standard online RL objectives to low-uncertainty samples to smoothly bridge offline and online stages. SUNG achieves state-of-the-art online finetuning performance when combined with different offline RL methods, across various environments and datasets in D4RL benchmark.

Abstract: Underground gas storage (UGS) is a critical technology for managing seasonal gas consumption peaks, increasingly important in the face of market uncertainties. However, safety concerns arise when reactivating pre-existing faults in faulted basins, where human activities may trigger seismic events. Typically, faults are reactivated when shear stress exceeds a critical frictional threshold, but unexpected fault reactivations have been observed during cushion gas injection (CGI) and UGS cycles in the Netherlands, even when the stress regime suggests stability. This two-part study introduces a novel simulation framework to better understand the mechanisms behind fault reactivation in complex settings such as the Rotliegend formation in the Netherlands. A 3D mathematical model coupling frictional contact mechanics in faulted porous rocks with fluid flow allows for predictive analysis of fault behavior. The effect of the storage of different fluids for various purposes, such as the long-term sequestration of CO2, the regular injection and extraction cycles of CH4, and the highly irregular cycles of H2, is investigated with respect to fault activation hazard. The ultimate goal is to define a safe operational bandwidth for UGS activities in faulted reservoirs. Part I of this work presents this comprehensive simulation tool where a slip-weakening constitutive law is introduced to model fault behavior. The approach is designed to address the complex geological setting that characterizes the Rotliegend formation, where multiple factors influence the behavior of fault systems. We succeed in explaining and modeling the occurrence of unexpected fault reactivations. The analysis shows that reactivation during primary production (PP) causes stress redistribution, leading to a new deformed equilibrated configuration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2308.02198v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feature Propagation on Knowledge Graphs using Cellular Sheaves</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03773</link><description>arXiv:2309.03773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many inference tasks on knowledge graphs, including relation prediction, operate on knowledge graph embeddings -- vector representations of the vertices (entities) and edges (relations) that preserve task-relevant structure encoded within the underlying combinatorial object. Such knowledge graph embeddings can be modeled as an approximate global section of a cellular sheaf, an algebraic structure over the graph. Using the diffusion dynamics encoded by the corresponding sheaf Laplacian, we optimally propagate known embeddings of a subgraph to inductively represent new entities introduced into the knowledge graph at inference time. We implement this algorithm via an efficient iterative scheme and show that on a number of large-scale knowledge graph embedding benchmarks, our method is competitive with -- and in some scenarios outperforms -- more complex models derived explicitly for inductive knowledge graph reasoning tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2309.03773v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProSGNeRF: Progressive Dynamic Neural Scene Graph with Frequency Modulated Foundation Model in Urban Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09076</link><description>arXiv:2312.09076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit neural representation has demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction on various scenes. However, existing approaches either struggle to model fast-moving objects or are incapable of handling large-scale camera ego-motions in urban environments. This leads to low-quality synthesized views of the large-scale urban scenes. In this paper, we aim to jointly solve the problems caused by large-scale scenes and fast-moving vehicles, which are more practical and challenging. To this end, we propose a progressive scene graph network architecture to learn the local scene representations of dynamic objects and global urban scenes. The progressive learning architecture dynamically allocates a new local scene graph trained on frames within a temporal window, with the window size automatically determined, allowing us to scale up the representation to arbitrarily large scenes. Besides, according to our observations, the training views of dynamic objects are relatively sparse according to rapid movements, which leads to a significant decline in reconstruction accuracy for dynamic objects. Therefore, we utilize a foundation model network to encode the latent code. Specifically, we leverage the generalization capability of the visual foundation model DINOv2 to extract appearance and shape codes, and train the network on a large-scale urban scene object dataset to enhance its prior modeling ability for handling sparse-view dynamic inputs. In parallel, we introduce a frequency-modulated module that regularizes the frequency spectrum of objects, thereby addressing the challenge of modeling sparse image inputs from a frequency-domain perspective. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis accuracy, object manipulation, and scene roaming ability in various scenes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2312.09076v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Shares What?

Abstract: Security conferences are important venues for information sharing, where academics and practitioners share knowledge about new attacks and state-of-the-art defenses. Despite their importance, researchers have not systematically examined who shares information and which security topics are discussed. To address this gap, our paper characterizes the speakers, sponsors, and topics presented at prestigious academic and industry security conferences. We compile a longitudinal dataset containing 9,728 abstracts and 1,686 sponsors across four academic and six industry conferences. Our findings show limited information sharing between industry and academia. Conferences vary significantly in how equitably talks and authorship are distributed across individuals. The topics of academic and industry abstracts display consistent coverage of techniques within the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK framework. Top-tier academic conferences, as well as DEFCON and Black Hat, address the governance, response, and recovery functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework inconsistently. Commercial information security and insurance conferences (RSA, Gartner, Advisen and NetDiligence) more consistently cover the framework. Prevention and detection were the most common topics in the sample period, with no clear temporal trends.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.17989v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Value Improved Actor Critic Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01423</link><description>arXiv:2406.01423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To learn approximately optimal acting policies for decision problems, modern Actor Critic algorithms rely on deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to parameterize the acting policy and greedification operators to iteratively improve it. The reliance on DNNs suggests an improvement that is gradient based, which is per step much less greedy than the improvement possible by greedier operators such as the greedy update used by Q-learning algorithms. On the other hand, slow changes to the policy can also be beneficial for the stability of the learning process, resulting in a tradeoff between greedification and stability. To better address this tradeoff, we propose to decouple the acting policy from the policy evaluated by the critic. This allows the agent to separately improve the critic's policy (e.g. value improvement) with greedier updates while maintaining the slow gradient-based improvement to the parameterized acting policy. We investigate the convergence of this approach using the popular analysis scheme of generalized Policy Iteration in the finite-horizon domain. Empirically, incorporating value-improvement into the popular off-policy actor-critic algorithms TD3 and SAC significantly improves or matches performance over their respective baselines, across different environments from the DeepMind continuous control domain, with negligible compute and implementation cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.01423v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zeroing neural dynamics solving time-variant complex conjugate matrix equation $X(\tau)F(\tau)-A(\tau)\overline{X}(\tau)=C(\tau)$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12783</link><description>arXiv:2406.12783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex conjugate matrix equations (CCME) are important in computation and antilinear systems. Existing research mainly focuses on the time-invariant version, while studies on the time-variant version and its solution using artificial neural networks are still lacking. This paper introduces zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) to solve the earliest time-variant CCME. Firstly, the vectorization and Kronecker product in the complex field are defined uniformly. Secondly, Con-CZND1 and Con-CZND2 models are proposed, and their convergence and effectiveness are theoretically proved. Thirdly, numerical experiments confirm their effectiveness and highlight their differences. The results show the advantages of ZND in the complex field compared with that in the real field, and further refine the related theory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.12783v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Balanced Edge Pruning for Graph Anomaly Detection with Noisy Labels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05934</link><description>arXiv:2407.05934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is widely applied in many areas, such as financial fraud detection and social spammer detection. Anomalous nodes in the graph not only impact their own communities but also create a ripple effect on neighbors throughout the graph structure. Detecting anomalous nodes in complex graphs has been a challenging task. While existing GAD methods assume all labels are correct, real-world scenarios often involve inaccurate annotations. These noisy labels can severely degrade GAD performance because, with anomalies representing a minority class, even a small number of mislabeled instances can disproportionately interfere with detection models. Cutting edges to mitigate the negative effects of noisy labels is a good option; however, it has both positive and negative influences and also presents an issue of weak supervision. To perform effective GAD with noisy labels, we propose REinforced Graph Anomaly Detector (REGAD) by pruning the edges of candidate nodes potentially with mistaken labels. Moreover, we design the performance feedback based on strategically crafted confident labels to guide the cutting process, ensuring optimal results. Specifically, REGAD contains two novel components. (i) A tailored policy network, which involves two-step actions to remove negative effect propagation step by step. (ii) A policy-in-the-loop mechanism to identify suitable edge removal strategies that control the propagation of noise on the graph and estimate the updated structure to obtain reliable pseudo labels iteratively. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that REGAD outperforms all baselines under different noisy ratios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.05934v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FiCo-ITR: bridging fine-grained and coarse-grained image-text retrieval for comparative performance analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20114</link><description>arXiv:2407.20114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of Image-Text Retrieval (ITR), recent advancements have leveraged large-scale Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) for Fine-Grained (FG) instance-level retrieval, achieving high accuracy at the cost of increased computational complexity. For Coarse-Grained (CG) category-level retrieval, prominent approaches employ Cross-Modal Hashing (CMH) to prioritise efficiency, albeit at the cost of retrieval performance. Due to differences in methodologies, FG and CG models are rarely compared directly within evaluations in the literature, resulting in a lack of empirical data quantifying the retrieval performance-efficiency tradeoffs between the two. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the FiCo-ITR library, which standardises evaluation methodologies for both FG and CG models, facilitating direct comparisons. We conduct empirical evaluations of representative models from both subfields, analysing precision, recall, and computational complexity across varying data scales. Our findings offer new insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs between recent representative FG and CG models, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. These findings provide the foundation necessary to make more informed decisions regarding model selection for specific retrieval tasks and highlight avenues for future research into hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of both FG and CG approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.20114v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unexpected fault activation due to underground gas storage in produced reservoirs. Part II: Definition of safe operational bandwidths</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01049</link><description>arXiv:2408.01049v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underground gas storage is a versatile tool for managing energy resources and addressing pressing environmental concerns. While natural gas is stored in geological formations since the early 20th century, hydrogen has recently been considered as a potential candidate toward a more flexible and sustainable energy infrastructure. Furthermore, these formations can additionally capture gases that contribute to climate change, such as CO2. When such operations are implemented in faulted basins, however, safety concerns may arise due to the potential reactivation of pre-existing faults, which could trigger (micro)-seismicity events. In the Netherlands, it has been recently noted that fault reactivation can occur "unexpectedly" during the life of an underground gas storage (UGS) site, even when stress conditions are not expected to cause a failure. The present two-part work aims to develop a modeling framework to investigate the physical mechanisms causing such occurrences in previously produced gas reservoirs and define a safe operational bandwidth for pore pressure variation for UGS operations in the faulted reservoirs of the Upper Rotliegend Group, the Netherlands. This paper investigates in detail the mechanisms and crucial factors that result in fault reactivation at various stages of a UGS. The mathematical and numerical model described in Part I is used, also considering how the presence of stored gases may influence the mechanical properties of the reservoir and caprock, in particular the Young modulus. The study investigates the hazard of fault activation caused by the storage of different fluids for various purposes, such as long-term CO2 sequestration, CH4 and H2 injection and extraction cycles, and N2 injection as cushion gas. The results show how geological configuration, geomechanical properties, and reservoir operating conditions may increase the hazard of fault reactivation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.01049v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Effects of Collaboration on the Performance of Interactive Theme Discovery Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09030</link><description>arXiv:2408.09030v5 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Generating random bit streams is required in various applications, most notably cyber-security. Ensuring high-quality and robust randomness is crucial to mitigate risks associated with predictability and system compromise. True random numbers provide the highest unpredictability levels. However, potential biases in the processes exploited for the random number generation must be carefully monitored. This paper reports the implementation and characterization of an on-line procedure for the detection of anomalies in a true random bit stream. It is based on the NIST Adaptive Proportion and Repetition Count tests, complemented by statistical analysis relying on the Monobit and RUNS. The procedure is firmware implemented and performed simultaneously with the bit stream generation, and providing as well an estimate of the entropy of the source. The experimental validation of the approach is performed upon the bit streams generated by a quantum, silicon-based entropy source.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.05543v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Better Language Models Exhibit Higher Visual Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07173</link><description>arXiv:2410.07173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How well do text-only large language models (LLMs) align with the visual world? We present a systematic evaluation of this question by incorporating frozen representations of various language models into a discriminative vision-language framework and measuring zero-shot generalization to novel concepts. We find that decoder-based models exhibit stronger visual alignment than encoders, even when controlling for model and dataset size. Moreover, language modeling performance correlates with visual generalization, suggesting that advances in unimodal LLMs can simultaneously improve vision models. Leveraging these insights, we propose ShareLock, a lightweight method for fusing frozen vision and language backbones. ShareLock achieves robust performance across tasks while drastically reducing the need for paired data and compute. With just 563k image-caption pairs and under one GPU-hour of training, it reaches 51% accuracy on ImageNet. In cross-lingual settings, ShareLock dramatically outperforms CLIP, achieving 38.7% top-1 accuracy on Chinese image classification versus CLIP's 1.4%.

Abstract: We propose a scalable preconditioned primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). We multiply the PDE with a dual test function to obtain an inf-sup problem whose loss functional involves lower-order differential operators. The Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm is then leveraged for this saddle point problem. By introducing suitable precondition operators to the proximal steps in the PDHG algorithm, we obtain an alternative natural gradient ascent-descent optimization scheme for updating the neural network parameters. We apply the Krylov subspace method (MINRES) to evaluate the natural gradients efficiently. Such treatment readily handles the inversion of precondition matrices via matrix-vector multiplication. An \textit{a posteriori} convergence analysis is established for the time-continuous version of the proposed algorithm for general linear PDEs. By incorporating appropriate boundary loss terms, we further obtain a refined \textit{a priori} convergence result for elliptic equations in divergence form. The algorithm is tested on various types of PDEs with dimensions ranging from $1$ to $50$, including linear and nonlinear elliptic equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Monge-Amp\`ere equations stemming from the $L^2$ optimal transport problems. We compare the performance of the proposed method with several commonly used deep learning algorithms such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the DeepRitz method and weak adversarial networks (WANs) using either the Adam or the L-BFGS optimizer. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method performs efficiently and robustly and converges more stably with higher accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.06278v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FOF-X: Towards Real-time Detailed Human Reconstruction from a Single Image</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05961</link><description>arXiv:2412.05961v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce FOF-X for real-time reconstruction of detailed human geometry from a single image. Balancing real-time speed against high-quality results is a persistent challenge, mainly due to the high computational demands of existing 3D representations. To address this, we propose Fourier Occupancy Field (FOF), an efficient 3D representation by learning the Fourier series. The core of FOF is to factorize a 3D occupancy field into a 2D vector field, retaining topology and spatial relationships within the 3D domain while facilitating compatibility with 2D convolutional neural networks. Such a representation bridges the gap between 3D and 2D domains, enabling the integration of human parametric models as priors and enhancing the reconstruction robustness. Based on FOF, we design a new reconstruction framework, FOF-X, to avoid the performance degradation caused by texture and lighting. This enables our real-time reconstruction system to better handle the domain gap between training images and real images. Additionally, in FOF-X, we enhance the inter-conversion algorithms between FOF and mesh representations with a Laplacian constraint and an automaton-based discontinuity matcher, improving both quality and robustness. We validate the strengths of our approach on different datasets and real-captured data, where FOF-X achieves new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a growing field that demands accurate and trustworthy models of legal concepts and restrictions for navigating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In addition, any implementation of AAM needs to face the challenges posed by inherently dynamic and uncertain human-inhabited spaces robustly. Nevertheless, the employment of UAS beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to significantly enhance today's logistics and emergency response capabilities. Hence, we propose Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a novel neuro-symbolic approach to navigating UAS within legal frameworks. ProMis is an interpretable and adaptable system architecture that links uncertain geospatial data and noisy perception with declarative, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) to reason over the agent's state space and its legality. To inform planning with legal restrictions and uncertainty in mind, ProMis yields Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML). These scalar fields quantify the belief that the HPLP is satisfied across the agent's state space. Extending prior work on ProMis' reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models. Hence, our experiments underpin the application of ProMis with multi-modal input data and how our method applies to many AAM scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.01439v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Prototype Rehearsal for Continual ECG Arrhythmia Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07555</link><description>arXiv:2501.07555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) methods aim to learn from a sequence of tasks while avoiding the challenge of forgetting previous knowledge. We present DREAM-CL, a novel CL method for ECG arrhythmia detection that introduces dynamic prototype rehearsal memory. DREAM-CL selects representative prototypes by clustering data based on learning behavior during each training session. Within each cluster, we apply a smooth sorting operation that ranks samples by training difficulty, compressing extreme values and removing outliers. The more challenging samples are then chosen as prototypes for the rehearsal memory, ensuring effective knowledge retention across sessions. We evaluate our method on time-incremental, class-incremental, and lead-incremental scenarios using two widely used ECG arrhythmia datasets, Chapman and PTB-XL. The results demonstrate that DREAM-CL outperforms the state-of-the-art in CL for ECG arrhythmia detection. Detailed ablation and sensitivity studies are performed to validate the different design choices of our method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.07555v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Representing Molecules with Algebraic Data Types: Beyond SMILES and SELFIES</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633</link><description>arXiv:2501.13633v5 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning attack introduces significant security risks to the fine-tuning services. Main-stream defenses aim to vaccinate the model such that the later harmful fine-tuning attack is less effective. However, our evaluation results show that such defenses are fragile--with a few fine-tuning steps, the model still can learn the harmful knowledge. To this end, we do further experiment and find that an embarrassingly simple solution--adding purely random perturbations to the fine-tuned model, can recover the model from harmful behaviors, though it leads to a degradation in the model's fine-tuning performance. To address the degradation of fine-tuning performance, we further propose Panacea, which optimizes an adaptive perturbation that will be applied to the model after fine-tuning. Panacea maintains model's safety alignment performance without compromising downstream fine-tuning performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on different harmful ratios, fine-tuning tasks and mainstream LLMs, where the average harmful scores are reduced by up-to 21.2%, while maintaining fine-tuning performance. As a by-product, we analyze the adaptive perturbation and show that different layers in various LLMs have distinct safety affinity, which coincide with finding from several previous study.

Abstract: Stereotype biases in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) perpetuate harmful societal prejudices, undermining the fairness and equity of AI applications. As LMMs grow increasingly influential, addressing and mitigating inherent biases related to stereotypes, harmful generations, and ambiguous assumptions in real-world scenarios has become essential. However, existing datasets evaluating stereotype biases in LMMs often lack diversity, rely on synthetic images, and often have single-actor images, leaving a gap in bias evaluation for real-world visual contexts. To address the gap in bias evaluation using real images, we introduce the BBQ-Vision (BBQ-V), the most comprehensive framework for assessing stereotype biases across nine diverse categories and 50 sub-categories with real and multi-actor images. BBQ-V benchmark contains 14,144 image-question pairs and rigorously evaluates LMMs through carefully curated, visually grounded scenarios, challenging them to reason accurately about visual stereotypes. It offers a robust evaluation framework featuring real-world visual samples, image variations, and open-ended question formats. BBQ-V enables a precise and nuanced assessment of a model's reasoning capabilities across varying levels of difficulty. Through rigorous testing of 19 state-of-the-art open-source (general-purpose and reasoning) and closed-source LMMs, we highlight that these top-performing models are often biased on several social stereotypes, and demonstrate that the thinking models induce more bias in the reasoning chains. This benchmark represents a significant step toward fostering fairness in AI systems and reducing harmful biases, laying the groundwork for more equitable and socially responsible LMMs. Our dataset and evaluation code are publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.08779v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thompson Sampling for Repeated Newsvendor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09900</link><description>arXiv:2502.09900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of Thompson Sampling (TS) for online learning with censored feedback, focusing primarily on the classic repeated newsvendor model--a foundational framework in inventory management--and demonstrating how our techniques can be naturally extended to a broader class of problems. We first model demand using a Weibull distribution and initialize TS with a Gamma prior to dynamically adjust order quantities. Our analysis establishes optimal (up to logarithmic factors) frequentist regret bounds for TS without imposing restrictive prior assumptions. More importantly, it yields novel and highly interpretable insights on how TS addresses the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the repeated newsvendor setting. Specifically, our results show that when past order quantities are sufficiently large to overcome censoring, TS accurately estimates the unknown demand parameters, leading to near-optimal ordering decisions. Conversely, when past orders are relatively small, TS automatically increases future order quantities to gather additional demand information. Then, we extend our analysis to general parametric distribution family and provide proof for Bayesian regret. Extensive numerical simulations further demonstrate that TS outperforms more conservative and widely-used approaches such as online convex optimization, upper confidence bounds, and myopic Bayesian dynamic programming.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.09900v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Known Fakes: Generalized Detection of AI-Generated Images via Post-hoc Distribution Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10803</link><description>arXiv:2502.10803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of highly realistic AI-generated images poses serious security threats such as misinformation and identity fraud. Detecting generated images in open-world settings is particularly challenging when they originate from unknown generators, as existing methods typically rely on model-specific artifacts and require retraining on new fake data, limiting their generalization and scalability. In this work, we propose Post-hoc Distribution Alignment (PDA), a generalized and model-agnostic framework for detecting AI-generated images under unknown generative threats. Specifically, PDA reformulates detection as a distribution alignment task by regenerating test images through a known generative model. When real images are regenerated, they inherit model-specific artifacts and align with the known fake distribution. In contrast, regenerated unknown fakes contain incompatible or mixed artifacts and remain misaligned. This difference allows an existing detector, trained on the known generative model, to accurately distinguish real images from unknown fakes without requiring access to unseen data or retraining. Extensive experiments across 16 state-of-the-art generative models, including GANs, diffusion models, and commercial text-to-image APIs (e.g., Midjourney), demonstrate that PDA achieves average detection accuracy of 96.69%, outperforming the best baseline by 10.71%. Comprehensive ablation studies and robustness analyses further confirm PDA's generalizability and resilience to distribution shifts and image transformations. Overall, our work provides a practical and scalable solution for real-world AI-generated image detection where new generative models emerge continuously.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.10803v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Southern Newswires: A Large-Scale Study of Mid-Century Wire Content Beyond the Front Page</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11866</link><description>arXiv:2502.11866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes the construction of a large-scale corpus of historical wire articles from U.S. Southern newspapers, spanning 1960-1975 and covering multiple wire services (e.g., Associated Press, United Press International, Newspaper Enterprise Association). Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on front-page content, the corpus captures wire-sourced articles across the entire newspaper, offering broader insight into mid-century Southern news coverage. The analysis incorporates both raw OCR text and a version processed through an LLM-based text correction pipeline designed to reduce OCR noise and improve suitability for quantitative text analysis. Multiple versions of the same wire dispatch are retained, allowing for the study of editorial differences in language and framing across newspapers. Articles are classified by wire service, enabling comparative analysis of editorial patterns across agencies. Together, these features provide a detailed perspective on how Southern newspapers transmitted national and international news during a transformative period in American history.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.11866v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Theorem Prover as a Judge for Synthetic Data Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13137</link><description>arXiv:2502.13137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for synthetic data in mathematical reasoning has increased due to its potential to enhance the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, ensuring the validity of intermediate reasoning steps remains a significant challenge, affecting data quality. While formal verification via theorem provers effectively validates LLM reasoning, the autoformalisation of mathematical proofs remains error-prone. In response, we introduce iterative autoformalisation, an approach that iteratively refines theorem prover formalisation to mitigate errors, thereby increasing the execution rate on the Lean prover from 60% to 87%. Building upon that, we introduce Theorem Prover as a Judge (TP-as-a-Judge), a method that employs theorem prover formalisation to rigorously assess LLM intermediate reasoning, effectively integrating autoformalisation with synthetic data generation. Finally, we present Reinforcement Learning from Theorem Prover Feedback (RLTPF), a framework that replaces human annotation with theorem prover feedback in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Across multiple LLMs, applying TP-as-a-Judge and RLTPF improves benchmarks with only 3,508 samples, achieving 5.56% accuracy gain on Mistral-7B for MultiArith, 6.00% on Llama-2-7B for SVAMP, and 3.55% on Llama-3.1-8B for AQUA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.13137v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TriDF: Triplane-Accelerated Density Fields for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Novel View Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13347</link><description>arXiv:2503.13347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote sensing novel view synthesis (NVS) offers significant potential for 3D interpretation of remote sensing scenes, with important applications in urban planning and environmental monitoring. However, remote sensing scenes frequently lack sufficient multi-view images due to acquisition constraints. While existing NVS methods tend to overfit when processing limited input views, advanced few-shot NVS methods are computationally intensive and perform sub-optimally in remote sensing scenes. This paper presents TriDF, an efficient hybrid 3D representation for fast remote sensing NVS from as few as 3 input views. Our approach decouples color and volume density information, modeling them independently to reduce the computational burden on implicit radiance fields and accelerate reconstruction. We explore the potential of the triplane representation in few-shot NVS tasks by mapping high-frequency color information onto this compact structure, and the direct optimization of feature planes significantly speeds up convergence. Volume density is modeled as continuous density fields, incorporating reference features from neighboring views through image-based rendering to compensate for limited input data. Additionally, we introduce depth-guided optimization based on point clouds, which effectively mitigates the overfitting problem in few-shot NVS. Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing scenes demonstrate that our hybrid representation achieves a 30x speed increase compared to NeRF-based methods, while simultaneously improving rendering quality metrics over advanced few-shot methods (7.4% increase in PSNR and 3.4% in SSIM).

Abstract: Developers play a central role in determining how machine learning systems are explained in practice, yet they are rarely trained to design explanations for non-technical audiences. Despite this, transparency and explainability requirements are increasingly codified in regulation and organizational policy. It remains unclear how such policies influence developer behavior or the quality of the explanations they produce. We report results from two controlled experiments with 194 participants, typical developers without specialized training in human-centered explainable AI, who designed explanations for an ML-powered diabetic retinopathy screening tool. In the first experiment, differences in policy purpose and level of detail had little effect: policy guidance was often ignored and explanation quality remained low. In the second experiment, stronger enforcement increased formal compliance, but explanations largely remained poorly suited to medical professionals and patients. We further observed that across both experiments, developers repeatedly produced explanations that were technically flawed or difficult to interpret, framed for developers rather than end users, reliant on medical jargon, or insufficiently grounded in the clinical decision context and workflow, with developer-centric framing being the most prevalent. These findings suggest that policy and policy enforcement alone are insufficient to produce meaningful end-user explanations and that responsible AI frameworks may overestimate developers' ability to translate high-level requirements into human-centered designs without additional training, tools, or implementation support.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.15512v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Industrial-scale Product Configuration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00013</link><description>arXiv:2504.00013v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Smart contracts power decentralized financial (DeFi) services but are vulnerable to security exploits that can lead to significant financial losses. Existing security measures often fail to adequately protect these contracts due to the composability of DeFi protocols and the increasing sophistication of attacks. Through a large-scale empirical study of historical transactions from the 37 hacked DeFi protocols, we discovered that while benign transactions typically exhibit a limited number of unique control flows, in stark contrast, attack transactions consistently introduce novel, previously unobserved control flows. Building on these insights, we developed CrossGuard, a novel framework that enforces control flow integrity onchain to secure smart contracts. Crucially, CrossGuard does not require prior knowledge of specific hacks. Instead, configured only once at deployment, it enforces control flow whitelisting policies and applies simplification heuristics at runtime. This approach monitors and prevents potential attacks by reverting all transactions that do not adhere to the established control flow whitelisting rules. Our evaluation demonstrates that CrossGuard effectively blocks 35 of the 37 analyzed attacks when configured only once at contract deployment, maintaining a low false positive rate of 0.26% and minimal additional gas costs. These results underscore the efficacy of applying control flow integrity to smart contracts, significantly enhancing security beyond traditional methods and addressing the evolving threat landscape in the DeFi ecosystem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.05509v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Security Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts: A Systematic Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05968</link><description>arXiv:2504.05968v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart contracts are a secure and trustworthy application that plays a vital role in decentralized applications in various fields such as insurance,the internet, and gaming. However, in recent years, smart contract security breaches have occurred frequently, and due to their financial properties, they have caused huge economic losses, such as the most famous security incident "The DAO" which caused a loss of over $60 million in Ethereum. This has drawn a lot of attention from all sides. Writing a secure smart contract is now a critical issue. This paper focuses on Ether smart contracts and explains the main components of Ether, smart contract architecture and mechanism. The environment used in this paper is the Ethernet environment, using remix online compilation platform and Solidity language, according to the four security events of American Chain, The DAO, Parity and KotET, the principles of integer overflow attack, reentrant attack, access control attack and denial of service attack are studied and analyzed accordingly, and the scenarios of these vulnerabilities are reproduced, and the measures to prevent them are given. Finally, preventive measures are given. In addition, the principles of short address attack, early transaction attack and privileged function exposure attack are also introduced in detail, and security measures are proposed. As vulnerabilities continue to emerge, their classification will also evolve. The analysis and research of the current vulnerabilities are also to lay a solid foundation for avoiding more vulnerabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.05968v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepSeek-R1 Thoughtology: Let's think about LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07128</link><description>arXiv:2504.07128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models like DeepSeek-R1 mark a fundamental shift in how LLMs approach complex problems. Instead of directly producing an answer for a given input, DeepSeek-R1 creates detailed multi-step reasoning chains, seemingly "thinking" about a problem before providing an answer. This reasoning process is publicly available to the user, creating endless opportunities for studying the reasoning behaviour of the model and opening up the field of Thoughtology. Starting from a taxonomy of DeepSeek-R1's basic building blocks of reasoning, our analyses on DeepSeek-R1 investigate the impact and controllability of thought length, management of long or confusing contexts, cultural and safety concerns, and the status of DeepSeek-R1 vis-\`a-vis cognitive phenomena, such as human-like language processing and world modelling. Our findings paint a nuanced picture. Notably, we show DeepSeek-R1 has a 'sweet spot' of reasoning, where extra inference time can impair model performance. Furthermore, we find a tendency for DeepSeek-R1 to persistently ruminate on previously explored problem formulations, obstructing further exploration. We also note strong safety vulnerabilities of DeepSeek-R1 compared to its non-reasoning counterpart, which can also compromise safety-aligned LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.07128v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Let the Void Be Void: Robust Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning via Selective Non-Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12569</link><description>arXiv:2504.12569v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL) leverages unlabeled data containing both in-distribution (ID) and unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, aiming simultaneously to improve closed-set accuracy and detect novel OOD instances. Existing methods either discard valuable information from uncertain samples or force-align every unlabeled sample into one or a few synthetic "catch-all" representations, resulting in geometric collapse and overconfidence on only seen OODs. To address the limitations, we introduce selective non-alignment, adding a novel "skip" operator into conventional pull and push operations of contrastive learning. Our framework, SkipAlign, selectively skips alignment (pulling) for low-confidence unlabeled samples, retaining only gentle repulsion against ID prototypes. This approach transforms uncertain samples into a pure repulsion signal, resulting in tighter ID clusters and naturally dispersed OOD features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkipAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting unseen OOD data without sacrificing ID classification accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.12569v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ThinkFL: Self-Refining Failure Localization for Microservice Systems via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18776</link><description>arXiv:2504.18776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As modern microservice systems grow increasingly popular and complex-often consisting of hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained, interdependent components-they are becoming more susceptible to frequent and subtle failures. Ensuring system reliability therefore hinges on accurate and efficient failure localization. Traditional failure localization approaches based on small models lack the flexibility to adapt to diverse failure scenarios, while recent LLM-based methods suffer from two major limitations: they often rely on rigid invocation workflows that constrain the model's ability to dynamically explore optimal localization paths, and they require resource-intensive inference, making them cost-prohibitive for real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we explore the use of reinforcement fine-tuning to equip lightweight LLMs with reasoning and self-refinement capabilities, significantly improving the cost-effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based failure localization. We begin with an empirical study to identify three key capabilities essential for accurate localization. Building on these insights, we propose a progressive multi-stage GRPO fine-tuning framework, which integrates a multi-factor failure localization grader and a recursion-of-thought actor module. The resulting model, ThinkFL, not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs and baseline methods in localization accuracy but also reduces end-to-end localization latency from minutes to seconds, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.18776v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Precision to Perception: User-Centred Evaluation of Keyword Extraction Algorithms for Internet-Scale Contextual Advertising</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21667</link><description>arXiv:2504.21667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keyword extraction is a foundational task in natural language processing, underpinning countless real-world applications. One of these is contextual advertising, where keywords help predict the topical congruence between ads and their surrounding media contexts to enhance advertising effectiveness. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have improved keyword extraction capabilities but also introduced concerns about computational cost. Moreover, although the end-user experience is of vital importance, human evaluation of keyword extraction performances remains under-explored. This study provides a comparative evaluation of prevalent keyword extraction algorithms with different levels of complexity represented by~TF-IDF, KeyBERT, and Llama~2. To evaluate their effectiveness, a mixed-methods approach is employed, combining quantitative benchmarking with qualitative assessments from 855 participants through four survey-based experiments. The findings demonstrate that KeyBERT achieves an effective balance between user preferences and computational efficiency, compared to the other algorithms. We observe a clear overall preference for gold-standard keywords, but there is a misalignment between algorithmic benchmark performance and user ratings. This reveals a long-overlooked gap between traditional precision-focused metrics and user-perceived algorithm efficiency. The study underscores the importance of human-in-the-loop evaluation methodologies and proposes analytical tools to facilitate their implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.21667v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Lower Bounds for Two-Step Consensus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03627</link><description>arXiv:2505.03627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seminal result by Lamport shows that at least $\max\{2e+f+1,2f+1\}$ processes are required to implement partially synchronous consensus that tolerates $f$ process failures and can furthermore decide in two message delays under $e$ failures. This lower bound is matched by the classical Fast Paxos protocol. However, more recent practical protocols, such as Egalitarian Paxos, provide two-step decisions with fewer processes, seemingly contradicting the lower bound. We show that this discrepancy arises because the classical bound requires two-step decisions under a wide range of scenarios, not all of which are relevant in practice. We propose a more pragmatic condition for which we establish tight bounds on the number of processes required. Interestingly, these bounds depend on whether consensus is implemented as an atomic object or a decision task. For consensus as an object, $\max\{2e+f-1,2f+1\}$ processes are necessary and sufficient for two-step decisions, while for a task the tight bound is $\max\{2e+f, 2f+1\}$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.03627v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data Standards in Audiology: A Mixed-Methods Exploration of Community Perspectives and Implementation Considerations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04728</link><description>arXiv:2505.04728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: This study addresses conceptual issues around data standardisation in audiology, and outlines steps toward achieving it. It reports a survey of the computational audiology community on their current understanding, needs, and preferences concerning data standards. Based on survey findings and a panel discussion, recommendations are made concerning moving forward with standardisation in audiology.
  Design: Mixed-methods: 1) review of existing standardisation efforts; 2) a survey of the computational audiology community; 3) expert panel discussion in a dedicated session at the 2024 Virtual Conference of Computational Audiology. Sample: Survey: 82 members of the global community; Panel discussion: five experts.
  Results: A prerequisite for any global audiology database are agreed data standards. Although many are familiar with the general idea, few know of existing initiatives, or have actively participated in them. Ninety percent of respondents expressed willingness to follow or contribute to standardisation efforts. The panel discussed relevant initiatives (e.g. OMOP, openEHR, Noah) and explored both challenges (around harmonisation) and opportunities (alignment with other medical fields and conversion among approaches).
  Conclusions: Combining conceptual discussion with stakeholder views, the study offers guidance for implementing interoperable data standards in audiology. It highlights community support, key issues to address, and suggests paths for future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.04728v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProteinGuide: On-the-fly property guidance for protein sequence generative models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04823</link><description>arXiv:2505.04823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequence generative models are transforming protein engineering. However, no principled framework exists for conditioning these models on auxiliary information, such as experimental data, without additional training of a generative model. Herein, we present ProteinGuide, a method for such "on-the-fly" conditioning, amenable to a broad class of protein generative models including Masked Language Models (e.g. ESM3), any-order auto-regressive models (e.g. ProteinMPNN) as well as diffusion and flow matching models (e.g. MultiFlow). ProteinGuide stems from our unifying view of these model classes under a single statistical framework. As proof of principle, we perform several in silico experiments. We first guide pre-trained generative models to design proteins with user-specified properties, such as higher stability or activity. Next, we design for optimizing two desired properties that are in tension with each other. Finally, we apply our method in the wet lab, using ProteinGuide to increase the editing activity of an adenine base editor in vivo with data from only a single pooled library of 2,000 variants. We find that a single round of ProteinGuide achieves a higher editing efficiency than was previously achieved using seven rounds of directed evolution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.04823v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AC-PKAN: Attention-Enhanced and Chebyshev Polynomial-Based Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08687</link><description>arXiv:2505.08687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently shown promise for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Yet their original formulation is computationally and memory intensive, motivating the introduction of Chebyshev Type-I-based KANs (Chebyshev1KANs). Although Chebyshev1KANs have outperformed the vanilla KANs architecture, our rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that they still suffer from rank collapse, ultimately limiting their expressive capacity. To overcome these limitations, we enhance Chebyshev1KANs by integrating wavelet-activated MLPs with learnable parameters and an internal attention mechanism. We prove that this design preserves a full-rank Jacobian and is capable of approximating solutions to PDEs of arbitrary order. Furthermore, to alleviate the loss instability and imbalance introduced by the Chebyshev polynomial basis, we externally incorporate a Residual Gradient Attention (RGA) mechanism that dynamically re-weights individual loss terms according to their gradient norms and residual magnitudes. By jointly leveraging internal and external attention, we present AC-PKAN, a novel architecture that constitutes an enhancement to weakly supervised Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and extends the expressive power of KANs. Experimental results from nine benchmark tasks across three domains show that AC-PKAN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as PINNsFormer, establishing it as a highly effective tool for solving complex real-world engineering problems in zero-data or data-sparse regimes. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.08687v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARC-AGI-2: A New Challenge for Frontier AI Reasoning Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11831</link><description>arXiv:2505.11831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI), introduced in 2019, established a challenging benchmark for evaluating the general fluid intelligence of artificial systems via a set of unique, novel tasks only requiring minimal prior knowledge. While ARC-AGI has spurred significant research activity over the past five years, recent AI progress calls for benchmarks capable of finer-grained evaluation at higher levels of cognitive complexity. We introduce ARC-AGI-2, an upgraded version of the benchmark. ARC-AGI-2 preserves the input-output pair task format of its predecessor, ensuring continuity for researchers. It incorporates a newly curated and expanded set of tasks specifically designed to provide a more granular signal to assess abstract reasoning and problem-solving abilities at higher levels of fluid intelligence. To contextualize the difficulty and characteristics of ARC-AGI-2, we present extensive results from human testing, providing a robust baseline that highlights the benchmark's accessibility to human intelligence, yet difficulty for current AI systems. ARC-AGI-2 aims to serve as a next-generation tool for rigorously measuring progress towards more general and human-like AI capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.11831v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lost in Benchmarks?

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) via benchmarks is widespread, yet inconsistencies between different leaderboards and poor separability among top models raise concerns about their ability to accurately reflect authentic model capabilities. This paper provides a critical analysis of benchmark effectiveness, examining mainstream prominent LLM benchmarks using results from diverse models. We first propose Pseudo-Siamese Network for Item Response Theory (PSN-IRT), an enhanced Item Response Theory framework that incorporates a rich set of item parameters within an IRT-grounded architecture. PSN-IRT can be utilized for accurate and reliable estimations of item characteristics and model abilities. Based on PSN-IRT, we conduct extensive analysis on 11 LLM benchmarks comprising 41,871 items, revealing significant and varied shortcomings in their measurement quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that leveraging PSN-IRT is able to construct smaller benchmarks while maintaining stronger alignment with human preference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.15055v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modelling the Spread of New Information on X</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15370</link><description>arXiv:2505.15370v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been considerable interest in modelling the spread of information on X (formerly Twitter) using machine learning models. Here, we consider the problem of predicting the reposting of new information, i.e., when a user propagates information about a topic previously unseen by the user. In existing work, information and users are randomly assigned to a test or training set, ensuring that both sets are drawn from the same distribution. In the spread of new information, the problem becomes an out-of-distribution classification task.
  Our experimental results reveal that while existing algorithms, which predominantly use features derived from the content of posts, perform well when the training and test distributions are the same, they perform much worse when the test set is out-of-distribution, i.e., when the topic of the testing data is absent from the training data. We then show that if the post features are supplemented or replaced with features derived from user profiles and past behaviours, the out-of-distribution prediction is greatly improved, with the F1 score increasing from 0.117 to 0.705. Our experimental results suggest that a significant component of reposting behaviour for previously unseen topics can be predicted from user profiles and past behaviours, and is largely content-agnostic.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.15370v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DecoupledESC: Enhancing Emotional Support Generation via Strategy-Response Decoupled Preference Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16995</link><description>arXiv:2505.16995v2 Announce Type: replace

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) shows promise in reducing such errors through pairwise preference learning, its effectiveness in ESC tasks is limited by two key challenges: (1) Entangled data structure: Existing ESC data inherently entangles psychological strategies and response content, making it difficult to construct high-quality preference pairs; and (2) Optimization ambiguity: Applying vanilla DPO to such entangled pairwise data leads to ambiguous training objectives. To address these issues, we introduce Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) to construct high-quality preference data, forming the IPM-PrefDial dataset. Building upon this data, we propose a Decoupled ESC framework inspired by Gross's Extended Process Model of Emotion Regulation, which decomposes the ESC task into two sequential subtasks: strategy planning and empathic response generation. Each was trained via SFT and subsequently enhanced by DPO to align with the psychological preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Decoupled ESC framework outperforms joint optimization baselines, reducing preference bias and improving response quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.16995v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An insight on some properties of high order nonstandard linear multistep methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17606</link><description>arXiv:2505.17606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, nonstandard multistep methods are considered. It is shown that under some (sufficient and necessary) conditions, these methods attain the same order as their standard counterparts - to prove this statement, a nonstandard version of Taylor's series is constructed. The preservation of some qualitative properties (boundedness, the linear combination of the components, and a property similar to monotonicity) is also proven for all step sizes. The methods are applied to a one-dimensional equation and a system of equations, in which the numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.17606v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RCCDA: Adaptive Model Updates in the Presence of Concept Drift under a Constrained Resource Budget</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24149</link><description>arXiv:2505.24149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms deployed in real-world environments are often faced with the challenge of adapting models to concept drift, where the task data distributions are shifting over time. The problem becomes even more difficult when model performance must be maintained under adherence to strict resource constraints. Existing solutions often depend on drift-detection methods that produce high computational overhead for resource-constrained environments, and fail to provide strict guarantees on resource usage or theoretical performance assurances. To address these shortcomings, we propose RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while ensuring compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy, we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight greedy-optimal policy that provably limits update frequency and cost. Experimental results on four domain generalization datasets demonstrate that our policy outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while adhering to strict resource constraints under several schedules of concept drift, making our solution uniquely suited for real-time ML deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.24149v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robot-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Embodied Reasoning in Robotics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00070</link><description>arXiv:2506.00070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown great promise in advancing robotics by combining embodied reasoning with robot control. A common approach involves training on embodied reasoning tasks related to robot control using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, SFT datasets are often heuristically constructed and not explicitly optimized for improving robot control. Furthermore, SFT often leads to issues such as catastrophic forgetting and reduced generalization performance. To address these limitations, we introduce Robot-R1, a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance embodied reasoning specifically for robot control. Robot-R1 learns to predict the next keypoint state required for task completion, conditioned on the current scene image and environment metadata derived from expert demonstrations. Inspired by the DeepSeek-R1 learning approach, Robot-R1 samples reasoning-based responses and reinforces those that lead to more accurate predictions. To rigorously evaluate Robot-R1, we also introduce a new benchmark that demands the diverse embodied reasoning capabilities for the task. Our experiments show that models trained with Robot-R1 outperform SFT methods on embodied reasoning tasks. Despite having only 7B parameters, Robot-R1 even surpasses GPT-4o on reasoning tasks related to low-level action control, such as spatial and movement reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.00070v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chandomitra: Towards Generating Structured Sanskrit Poetry from Natural Language Inputs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00815</link><description>arXiv:2506.00815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text Generation has achieved remarkable performance using large language models. It has also been recently well-studied that these large language models are capable of creative generation tasks but prominently for high-resource languages. This prompts a fundamental question: Is there a way to utilize these (large) language models for structured poetry generation in a low-resource language, such as Sanskrit? We present Chandomitra, an English input to structured Sanskrit Poetry translation dataset, specifically adhering to the Anushtubh meter. We benchmark various open and closed models, and scrutinize specialized techniques such as constrained decoding and instruction fine-tuning, for the proposed task. Our constrained decoding methodology achieves 99.86% syntactic accuracy in generating metrically valid Sanskrit poetry, outperforming GPT-4o (1-shot: 31.24%). Our best-performing instruction-tuned model, on the other hand, performs better in semantic coherence with the English input, at the expense of slightly lower syntactic accuracy. Human evaluation further reveals that instruction fine-tuned model is better able to capture the poetic aspects. Data and Code are available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.00815v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ThinkEval: Practical Evaluation of Knowledge Leakage in LLM Editing using Thought-based Knowledge Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01386</link><description>arXiv:2506.01386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust model-editing techniques are essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in practical applications, as they enable cost-effective ways to deal with challenges such as privacy breaches, bias mitigation and misinformation spread. For example, an LLM-based healthcare assistance may need to update out-dated or incorrect knowledge to prevent harmful recommendations. However, many editing techniques focus on isolated facts, which critically fail to prevent indirect knowledge leakage -- the unintended reconstruction of edited-out information through persistent causal links and contextual relationships. To assist users in selecting the right editing technique, we develop and present ThinkEval, a framework to systematically quantify indirect knowledge leakage and ripple effects in model-editing. ThinkEval builds and employs specialized knowledge graphs to analyze the causal structure of facts before and after editing. To support this approach, we present KnowGIC, a benchmark dataset comprising multi-step reasoning paths that precisely measure these complex knowledge transformation effects. We evaluate five editing techniques: AlphaEdit, RECT, ROME, MEMIT, and PRUNE across multiple LLMs. Our results show that these techniques struggle to balance indirect fact suppression with the preservation of related knowledge, compromising the contextual integrity of a model's knowledge. Our dataset is available at: https://github.com/manitbaser/KnowGIC.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.01386v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tug-of-war between idioms' figurative and literal interpretations in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01723</link><description>arXiv:2506.01723v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their non-compositional figurative interpretations, which often strongly diverge from the idiom's literal interpretation. In this paper, we employ causal tracing to systematically analyze how pretrained causal transformers deal with this ambiguity. We localize three mechanisms: (i) Early sublayers and specific attention heads retrieve an idiom's figurative interpretation, while suppressing its literal interpretation. (ii) When disambiguating context precedes the idiom, the model leverages it from the earliest layer and later layers refine the interpretation if the context conflicts with the retrieved interpretation. (iii) Then, selective, competing pathways carry both interpretations: an intermediate pathway prioritizes the figurative interpretation and a parallel direct route favors the literal interpretation, ensuring that both readings remain available. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in autoregressive transformers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.01723v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fodor and Pylyshyn's Legacy: Still No Human-like Systematic Compositionality in Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01820</link><description>arXiv:2506.01820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong meta-learning capabilities for systematic compositionality are emerging as an important skill for navigating the complex and changing tasks of today's world. However, in presenting models for robust adaptation to novel environments, it is important to refrain from making unsupported claims about the performance of meta-learning systems that ultimately do not stand up to scrutiny. While Fodor and Pylyshyn famously posited that neural networks inherently lack this capacity as they are unable to model compositional representations or structure-sensitive operations, and thus are not a viable model of the human mind, Lake and Baroni recently presented meta-learning as a pathway to compositionality. In this position paper, we critically revisit this claim and highlight limitations in the proposed meta-learning framework for compositionality. Our analysis shows that modern neural meta-learning systems can only perform such tasks, if at all, under a very narrow and restricted definition of a meta-learning setup. We therefore claim that `Fodor and Pylyshyn's legacy' persists, and to date, there is no human-like systematic compositionality learned in neural networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.01820v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stabilization of Linear Switched Systems with Long Constant Input Delay via Average or Averaging Predictor Feedbacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03908</link><description>arXiv:2506.03908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop delay-compensating feedback laws for linear switched systems with time-dependent switching. Because the future values of the switching signal, which are needed for constructing an exact predictor-feedback law, may be unavailable at current time, the key design challenge is how to construct a proper predictor state. We resolve this challenge constructing two alternative, average predictor-based feedback laws. The first is viewed as a predictor-feedback law for a particular average system, properly modified to provide exact state predictions over a horizon that depends on a minimum dwell time of the switching signal (when it is available). The second is, essentially, a modification of an average of predictor feedbacks, each one corresponding to the fixed-mode predictor-feedback law. We establish that under the control laws introduced, the closed-loop systems are (uniformly) exponentially stable, provided that the differences among system's matrices and among (nominal stabilizing) controller's gains are sufficiently small, with a size that is inversely proportional to the delay length. Since no restriction is imposed on the delay, such a limitation is inherent to the problem considered (in which the future switching signal values are unavailable), and thus, it cannot be removed. The stability proof relies on multiple Lyapunov functionals constructed via backstepping and derivation of solutions' estimates for quantifying the difference between average and exact predictor states. We present consistent numerical simulation results, which illustrate the necessity of employing the average predictor-based laws and demonstrate the performance improvement when the knowledge of a minimum dwell time is properly utilized for improving state prediction accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.03908v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human-AI Alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models with Speech-Language Pathologists in Parent-Child Interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05879</link><description>arXiv:2506.05879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative development, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert guidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise, demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to support parent-child interaction analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.05879v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physiological-model-based neural network for modeling the metabolic-heart rate relationship during physical activities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10144</link><description>arXiv:2506.10144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake (VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical activities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10144v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SDialog: A Python Toolkit for End-to-End Agent Building, User Simulation, Dialog Generation, and Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10622</link><description>arXiv:2506.10622v3 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance, ranging from simple to complex tasks. However, while large proprietary models (e.g., models with over 100B parameters) achieve remarkable results across diverse tasks, they are often accessible through costly APIs, making frequent use too costly for many applications. In contrast, small open-source models (e.g., models with fewer than 3B parameters) are freely available and easy to deploy locally, but their performance on complex tasks remains limited. This trade-off raises a natural question: how can small and large models efficiently collaborate to combine their complementary strengths? To bridge this trade-off, we propose COPE, a test-time collaboration framework. A planner model first generates a plan that serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a downstream executor model. Small and large models take turns acting as planner and executor, exchanging plans in a multi-stage cascade to collaboratively solve tasks. Through comprehensive experiments on benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, open-ended tasks, and agent tasks, we demonstrate that COPE achieves performance comparable to large proprietary models, while drastically reducing the inference API cost. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for cost-efficient inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.11578v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] T$^2$-RAGBench: Text-and-Table Benchmark for Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12071</link><description>arXiv:2506.12071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since many real-world documents combine textual and tabular data, robust Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for effectively accessing and analyzing such content to support complex reasoning tasks. Therefore, this paper introduces $\textbf{$T^2$-RAGBench}$, a benchmark comprising $\textbf{23,088}$ question-context-answer triples, designed to evaluate RAG methods on real-world text-and-table data. Unlike typical QA datasets that operate under $\textit{Oracle Context}$ settings, $\textbf{$T^2$-RAGBench}$ challenges models to first retrieve the correct context before conducting numerical reasoning. Existing QA datasets containing text-and-table data typically contain context-dependent questions, which may yield multiple correct answers depending on the provided context. To address this, we transform SOTA datasets into a context-independent format, validated by experts as 91.3% context-independent questions, enabling reliable RAG evaluation. Our comprehensive evaluation identifies $\textit{Hybrid BM25}$ , a technique that combines dense and sparse vectors, as the most effective approach for text-and-table data. However, results demonstrate that $\textbf{$T^2$-RAGBench}$ remains challenging even for SOTA LLMs and RAG methods. Further ablation studies examine the impact of embedding models and corpus size on retrieval performance. $\textbf{$T^2$-RAGBench}$ provides a realistic and rigorous benchmark for existing RAG methods on text-and-table data.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, yet generating coherent image sequences for visual storytelling remains challenging. A key challenge is effectively leveraging all previous text-image pairs, referred to as history text-image pairs, which provide contextual information for maintaining consistency across frames. Existing auto-regressive methods condition on all past image-text pairs but require extensive training, while training-free subject-specific approaches ensure consistency but lack adaptability to narrative prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-modal history adapter for text-to-image diffusion models, \textbf{ViSTA}. It consists of (1) a multi-modal history fusion module to extract relevant history features and (2) a history adapter to condition the generation on the extracted relevant features. We also introduce a salient history selection strategy during inference, where the most salient history text-image pair is selected, improving the quality of the conditioning. Furthermore, we propose to employ a Visual Question Answering-based metric TIFA to assess text-image alignment in visual storytelling, providing a more targeted and interpretable assessment of generated images. Evaluated on the StorySalon and FlintStonesSV dataset, our proposed ViSTA model is not only consistent across different frames, but also well-aligned with the narrative text descriptions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.12198v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Makes a Good Speech Tokenizer for LLM-Centric Speech Generation?

Abstract: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of speech tokenizer designs in LLM-centric SLMs, augmented by speech heads and speaker modeling. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.12537v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MIST: Towards Multi-dimensional Implicit BiaS Evaluation of LLMs for Theory of Mind</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14161</link><description>arXiv:2506.14161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the model's ability to infer the mental states of others, with failures in this ability often manifesting as systemic implicit biases. Assessing this challenge is difficult, as traditional direct inquiry methods are often met with refusal to answer and fail to capture its subtle and multidimensional nature. Therefore, we propose MIST, which reconceptualizes the content model of stereotypes into multidimensional failures of ToM, specifically in the domains of competence, sociability, and morality. The framework introduces two indirect tasks. The Word Association Bias Test (WABT) assesses implicit lexical associations, while the Affective Attribution Test (AAT) measures implicit emotional tendencies, aiming to uncover latent stereotypes without triggering model avoidance. Through extensive experimentation on eight state-of-the-art LLMs, our framework demonstrates the ability to reveal complex bias structures and improved robustness. All data and code will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.14161v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Synthetic Benchmark for Collaborative 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction in V2X-Enabled Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17004</link><description>arXiv:2506.17004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric details and semantic categories. However, its effectiveness is inherently constrained in single-vehicle setups by occlusions, restricted sensor range, and narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the completeness and accuracy of predictions. Despite its potential, research on collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction is hindered by the lack of dedicated datasets. To bridge this gap, we design a high-resolution semantic voxel sensor in CARLA to produce dense and comprehensive annotations. We further develop a baseline model that performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention aggregation. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial extent on collaborative prediction. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our baseline, with increasing gains observed as range expands.

Abstract: Embodied carbon footprint modeling has become an area of growing interest due to its significant contribution to carbon emissions in computing. However, the deterministic nature of the existing models fail to account for the spatial and temporal variability in the semiconductor supply chain. The absence of uncertainty modeling limits system designers' ability to make informed, carbon-aware decisions. We introduce CarbonClarity, a probabilistic framework designed to model embodied carbon footprints through distributions that reflect uncertainties in energy-per-area, gas-per-area, yield, and carbon intensity across different technology nodes. Our framework enables a deeper understanding of how design choices, such as chiplet architectures and new vs. old technology node selection, impact emissions and their associated uncertainties. For example, we show that the gap between the mean and 95th percentile of embodied carbon per cm$^2$ can reach up to 1.6X for the 7nm technology node. Additionally, we demonstrate through case studies that: (i) CarbonClarity is a valuable resource for device provisioning, help maintaining performance under a tight carbon budget; and (ii) chiplet technology and mature nodes not only reduce embodied carbon but also significantly lower its associated uncertainty, achieving an 18% reduction in the 95th percentile compared to monolithic designs for the mobile application.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01145v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Intensity-based Inversion Method for Quantitative Quasi-Static Elastography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01207</link><description>arXiv:2507.01207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the intensity-based inversion method (IIM) for quantitative material parameter estimation in quasi-static elastography. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the material parameters of a given sample from two internal measurements, one obtained before and one after applying some form of deformation. These internal measurements can be obtained via any imaging modality of choice, for example ultrasound, optical coherence or photo-acoustic tomography. Compared to two-step approaches to elastography, which first estimate internal displacement fields or strains and then reconstruct the material parameters from them, the IIM is a one-step approach which computes the material parameters directly from the internal measurements. To do so, the IIM combines image registration together with a model-based, regularized parameter reconstruction approach. This combination has the advantage of avoiding some approximations and derivative computations typically found in two-step approaches, and results in the IIM being generally more stable to measurement noise. In the paper, we provide a full convergence analysis of the IIM within the framework of inverse problems, and detail its application to linear elastography. Furthermore, we discuss the numerical implementation of the IIM and provide numerical examples simulating an optical coherence elastography (OCE) experiment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01207v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal-SAM-LLM: Large Language Models as Causal Reasoners for Robust Medical Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03585</link><description>arXiv:2507.03585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains. This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.03585v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StellarF: A Physics-Informed LoRA Framework for Stellar Flare Forecasting with Historical &amp; Statistical Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10986</link><description>arXiv:2507.10986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar flare forecasting represents a critical frontier in astrophysics, offering profound insights into stellar activity mechanisms and exoplanetary habitability assessments. Yet the inherent unpredictability of flare activity, rooted in stellar diversity and evolutionary stages, underpins the field's core challenges: (1) sparse, incomplete, noisy lightcurve data from traditional observations; (2) ineffective multi-scale flare evolution capture via single representations; (3) poor physical interpretability in data-driven models lacking physics-informed priors. To address these challenges, we propose StellarF, a physics-informed framework synergizing general Al with astrophysical domain knowledge via three core components: a unified preprocessing pipeline for lightcurve refinement (missing-value imputation, temporal patch partitioning, adaptive sample filtering); a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-finetuned large language model (LLM) backbone enhanced by first-order difference augmentation, flare statistical information, and flare historical record modules for multimodal fusion instead of only simple representations; and a novel physics-informed loss embedding a minimum rising rate prior, appended to the cross-entropy loss, to align with flare physics. Extensive experiments on Kepler and TESS datasets show StellarF achieves state-of-the-art performance across key metrics, setting new benchmarks for flare forecasting. This work bridges general AI with astrophysics, offering a practical, physically interpretable paradigm for transient event forecasting in time-domain astronomy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.10986v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Distributed Generative AI Approach for Heterogeneous Multi-Domain Environments under Data Sharing constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12979</link><description>arXiv:2507.12979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning has gained attention for its ability to enable multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables utilizing distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experiments show that our approach demonstrates significant improvements across key metrics, where it achieves an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 60% in multi-domain non-IID settings), 1.1x -- 3x higher image generation scores for the MNIST family datasets, and 2x -- 70x lower FID scores for higher resolution datasets.

Abstract: With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular, the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models, analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

Abstract: Interest in the role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, considering the new opportunities they offer for teaching, learning, and assessment. In this paper, we examine the impact of LLMs on educational NLP in the context of two main application scenarios: {\em assistance} and {\em assessment}, grounding them along the four dimensions -- reading, writing, speaking, and tutoring. We then present the new directions enabled by LLMs, and the key challenges to address.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) aims to convert human speech content into corresponding text. In conversational scenarios, effectively utilizing context can enhance its accuracy. Large Language Models' (LLMs) exceptional long-context understanding and reasoning abilities enable LLM-based ASR (LLM-ASR) to leverage historical context for recognizing conversational speech, which has a high degree of contextual relevance. However, existing conversational LLM-ASR methods use a fixed number of preceding utterances or the entire conversation history as context, resulting in significant ASR confusion and computational costs due to massive irrelevant and redundant information. This paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval-and-selection method named MARS that augments conversational LLM-ASR by enabling it to retrieve and select the most relevant acoustic and textual historical context for the current utterance. Specifically, multi-modal retrieval obtains a set of candidate historical contexts, each exhibiting high acoustic or textual similarity to the current utterance. Multi-modal selection calculates the acoustic and textual similarities for each retrieved candidate historical context and, by employing our proposed near-ideal ranking method to consider both similarities, selects the best historical context. Evaluations on the Interspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge dataset show that the LLM-ASR, when trained on only 1.5K hours of data and equipped with the MARS, outperforms the state-of-the-art top-ranking system trained on 179K hours of data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.01166v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01687</link><description>arXiv:2508.01687v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR--Post-hoc Attribution Rules--a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g. LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define human-readable intervals that indicate where and when decision-relevant segments occur and can enhance model transparency by localizing threshold-based conditions on the raw series. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations--a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon--into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR may improve interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks by providing concise, human-readable rules aligned with model predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.01687v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] U-PINet: Physics-Informed Hierarchical Learning for Radar Cross Section Prediction via 3D Electromagnetic Scattering Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03774</link><description>arXiv:2508.03774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional computational electromagnetics (CEM) solvers can deliver high fidelity radar cross section (RCS) signatures by first solving the induced surface currents on 3-dimensional (3D) targets and then evaluating the scattered fields via radiation integrals. However, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for repeated queries and large-scale 3D scenarios. Recent purely data-driven networks improve efficiency, yet they often bypass this scattering mechanism, which may compromise physical consistency and generalization. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose U-PINet, a fully end-to-end, physics-informed hierarchical network for efficient RCS prediction via 3D electromagnetic scattering reconstruction. Once the scattering quantities are reconstructed, scattered fields and RCS can be evaluated for arbitrary observation directions via the radiation integral. U-PINet explicitly learns physics-consistent intermediate scattering representations by modeling local electromagnetic coupling and long-range radiation effects through a hierarchical operator design inspired by near-far field decomposition in fast solvers. A physics-guided graph neural network is incorporated to capture self- and mutual-coupling among mesh elements of complex targets, enabling physically interpretable intermediate representations. By embedding governing equations as residual constraints, U-PINet enables accurate object reconstruction of scattering quantities and consequently reliable RCS prediction across observation directions, while significantly reducing runtime. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that U-PINet achieves EM-solver-level RCS accuracy and 3D object reconstruction with orders-of-magnitude speedups, and generalizes well to unseen geometries under limited training data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.03774v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Empathy Guidelines for Improving Practitioner Well-being &amp; Software Engineering Practices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03846</link><description>arXiv:2508.03846v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models at the core of system and data engineering processes. In the context of research data, these models are typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data integration for non-experts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05192v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Compressibility Barriers to Neighborhood-Preserving Data Visualizations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07119</link><description>arXiv:2508.07119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To what extent is it possible to visualize high-dimensional data in two- or three-dimensional plots? We reframe this question in terms of embedding $n$-vertex graphs (representing the neighborhood structure of the input points) into metric spaces of low doubling dimension $d$ in such a way that keeps neighbors close and non-neighbors far. This notion of neighbor preservation can be understood as a considerably weaker embedding constraint than near-isometry, yet it is similarly as demanding in terms of how the minimum required dimension scales with the number of points. We show that for an overwhelming fraction of graphs, $d = \Theta(\log n)$ is both necessary and sufficient for neighbor preservation. Even sparse regular graphs, which represent more restricted neighborhood connectivity structures, typically require $d= \Omega(\log n / \log\log n)$. The landscape changes dramatically when embedding into normed spaces: general graphs become exponentially harder to embed, requiring $d=\Omega(n)$, while sparse regular graphs continue to admit $d = O(\log n)$. Finally, we study the implications of these results for visualizing data with intrinsic cluster structure. We show that graphs produced from a planted partition model with $k$ clusters on $n$ points typically require $d=\Omega(\log n)$, even when the cluster structure is salient. These results challenge the aspiration that constant-dimensional visualizations can faithfully preserve neighborhood structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.07119v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are Multimodal Embeddings Truly Beneficial for Recommendation? A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399</link><description>arXiv:2508.07399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a mainstream paradigm, typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of text and visual embeddings in modern multimodal recommendation models, both as a whole and individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study, we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation models. Our findings reveal that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance - particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer foundational insights and practical guidance for the multimodal recommendation community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.07399v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast weight programming and linear transformers: from machine learning to neurobiology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08435</link><description>arXiv:2508.08435v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.08435v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entangled in Representations: Mechanistic Investigation of Cultural Biases in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08879</link><description>arXiv:2508.08879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse cultural contexts necessitates a deeper understanding of LLMs' representations of different cultures. Prior work has focused on evaluating the cultural awareness of LLMs by only examining the text they generate. This approach overlooks the internal sources of cultural misrepresentation within the models themselves. To bridge this gap, we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method that probes the internal representations of different cultural knowledge in LLMs. We also introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure of the intrinsic cultural biases of the decoded knowledge from Culturescope. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize cultural biases, which allows us to trace how cultural biases such as Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening emerge within LLMs. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to cultural biases, likely due to the model's limited parametric knowledge. Our work provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.08879v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MoLAN: A Unified Modality-Aware Noise Dynamic Editing Framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09145</link><description>arXiv:2508.09145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions. However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework. Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is a complex task, where changes often appear at different scales and orientations. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are good at capturing local spatial patterns but cannot model global semantics due to limited receptive fields. Alternatively, transformers can model long-range dependencies but are data hungry, and RSCD datasets are not large enough to train these models effectively. To tackle this, this paper presents a new architecture for RSCD which adapts a segment anything (SAM) vision foundation model and processes features from the SAM encoder through a multi-receptive field ensemble to capture local and global change patterns. We propose an ensemble of spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) to capture cross-temporal relations, a decoder to reconstruct change patterns, and a multi-scale decoder fusion with attention (MSDFA) to fuse multi-scale decoder information and highlight key change patterns. Each branch in an ensemble operates on a separate receptive field to capture finer-to-coarser level details. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to handle class-imbalance in RSCD datasets. Our work outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets, Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.97\% F1-score improvement on a complex S2Looking dataset.

Abstract: In \emph{Online Sorting}, an array of $n$ initially empty cells is given. At each time step $t$, an element $x_t \in [0,1]$ arrives and must be placed irrevocably into an empty cell without any knowledge of future arrivals. We aim to minimize the sum of absolute differences between pairs of elements placed in consecutive array cells, seeking an online placement strategy that results in a final array close to a sorted one. An interesting multidimensional generalization, a.k.a. the \emph{Online Travelling Salesperson Problem}, arises when the request sequence consists of points in the $d$-dimensional unit cube and the objective is to minimize the sum of euclidean distances between points in consecutive cells. Motivated by the recent work of (Abrahamsen, Bercea, Beretta, Klausen and Kozma; ESA 2024), we consider the \emph{stochastic version} of Online Sorting (\textit{resp.} Online TSP), where each element (\textit{resp.} point) $x_t$ is an i.i.d. sample from the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$ (\textit{resp.} $[0,1]^d$). By carefully decomposing the request sequence into a hierarchy of balls-into-bins instances, where the balls to bins ratio is large enough so that bin occupancy is sharply concentrated around its mean and small enough so that we can efficiently deal with the elements placed in the same bin, we obtain an online algorithm that approximates the optimal cost within a factor of $O(\log^2 n)$ with high probability. Our result comprises an exponential improvement on the previously best known competitive ratio of $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ for Stochastic Online Sorting due to (Abrahamsen et al.; ESA 2024) and $O(\sqrt{n})$ for (adversarial) Online TSP due to (Bertram, ESA 2025).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12527v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Sensor Placement for Cyclic Networks with Observability Guarantees: Application to Water Distribution Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13604</link><description>arXiv:2508.13604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal sensor placement is essential for state estimation and effective network monitoring. As known in the literature, this problem becomes particularly challenging in large-scale undirected or bidirected cyclic networks with parametric uncertainties, such as water distribution networks (WDNs), where pipe resistance and demand patterns are often unknown. Motivated by the challenges of cycles, parametric uncertainties, and scalability, this paper proposes a sensor placement algorithm that guarantees structural observability for cyclic and acyclic networks with parametric uncertainties. By leveraging a graph-based strategy, the proposed method efficiently addresses the computational complexities of large-scale networks. To demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, we apply it to several EPANET benchmark WDNs. Most notably, the developed algorithm solves the sensor placement problem with guaranteed structured observability for the L-town WDN with 1694 nodes and 124 cycles in under 0.1 seconds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.13604v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] V2P: Visual Attention Calibration for GUI Grounding via Background Suppression and Center Peaking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13634</link><description>arXiv:2508.13634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\% and 52.5\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro (see Fig.~\ref{fig:main_results_charts}). Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, underscoring V2P's generalizability in precise GUI grounding tasks and its potential for real-world deployment in future GUI agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.13634v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14022</link><description>arXiv:2508.14022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs, and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14022v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention Debiasing for Token Pruning in Vision Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17807</link><description>arXiv:2508.17807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) typically encode substantially more visual tokens than text tokens, resulting in significant token redundancy. Pruning uninformative visual tokens is therefore crucial for improving computational efficiency, and language-to-vision attention has become a widely used importance criterion for this purpose. However, we find that attention in VLMs is systematically biased. It disproportionately favors tokens appearing later in the sequence, manifesting as over-attention to lower image regions, and assigns inflated scores to semantically empty padding tokens. These behaviors stem from intrinsic recency bias and attention sink effects inherited from large language models (LLMs), and they distort attention-based pruning by preserving irrelevant visual content. To derive a pruning criterion better aligned with semantic relevance, we introduce two lightweight yet effective debiasing techniques that restore the reliability of attention. The first compensates for positional distortions by removing recency-induced attention trends, producing a content-aware and position-agnostic importance measure. The second suppresses attention sink effects by eliminating spurious attention on padding tokens. Our method is model-agnostic, pruning-method-agnostic, and task-agnostic, enabling plug-and-play integration with existing VLM pruning models. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently delivers strong performance gains. We evaluate our method on ten vision-language benchmarks spanning both image-based and video-based tasks, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art visual token pruning methods and across two representative VLM architectures. Our method achieves substantial performance gains, demonstrating strong effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes (cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination (DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines, often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20294v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AdaptCache: KV Cache Native Storage Hierarchy for Low-Delay and High-Quality Language Model Serving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00105</link><description>arXiv:2509.00105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.
  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.00105v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Superposition in Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00928</link><description>arXiv:2509.00928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts. We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.00928v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid dynamical systems modeling of power systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02822</link><description>arXiv:2509.02822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.02822v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Off Policy Lyapunov Stability in Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09863</link><description>arXiv:2509.09863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning lacks the ability to provide stability guarantees. More recent algorithms learn Lyapunov functions alongside the control policies to ensure stable learning. However, the current self-learned Lyapunov functions are sample inefficient due to their on-policy nature. This paper introduces a method for learning Lyapunov functions off-policy and incorporates the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function into the Soft Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms to provide them with a data efficient stability certificate. Simulations of an inverted pendulum and a quadrotor illustrate the improved performance of the two algorithms when endowed with the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.09863v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond the Silence: How Men Navigate Infertility Through Digital Communities and Data Sharing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10003</link><description>arXiv:2509.10003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Men experiencing infertility face unique challenges navigating Traditional Masculinity Ideologies that discourage emotional expression and help-seeking. This study examines how Reddit's r/maleinfertility community helps overcome these barriers through digital support networks. Using topic modeling (115 topics), network analysis (11 micro-communities), and time-lagged regression on 11,095 posts and 79,503 comments from 8,644 users, we found the community functions as a hybrid space: informal diagnostic hub, therapeutic commons, and governed institution. Medical advice dominates discourse (63.3\%), while emotional support (7.4\%) and moderation (29.2\%) create essential infrastructure. Sustained engagement correlates with actionable guidance and affiliation language, not emotional processing. Network analysis revealed structurally cohesive but topically diverse clusters without echo chamber characteristics. Cross-posters (20\% of users) who bridge r/maleinfertility and the gender-mixed r/infertility community serve as navigators and mentors, transferring knowledge between spaces. These findings inform trauma-informed design for stigmatized health communities, highlighting role-aware systems and navigation support.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.10003v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hetero-EUCLID: Interpretable model discovery for heterogeneous hyperelastic materials using stress-unsupervised learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11784</link><description>arXiv:2509.11784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a computational framework, Hetero-EUCLID, for segmentation and parameter identification to characterize the full hyperelastic behavior of all constituents of a heterogeneous material. In this work, we leverage the Bayesian-EUCLID (Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery) framework to efficiently solve the heterogenized formulation through parsimonious model selection using sparsity-promoting priors and Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling. We utilize experimentally observable 3D surface displacement and boundary-averaged force data generated from Finite Element simulations of non-equi-biaxial tension tests on heterogeneous specimens. The framework broadly consists of two steps -- residual force-based segmentation, and constitutive parameter identification. We validate and demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to segment the domain, and characterize the constituent materials on various types of thin square heterogeneous domains. We validate of the framework's ability to segment and characterize materials with various levels of displacement noises and non-native mesh discretizations, i.e, using different meshes for the forward FE simulations and the inverse EUCLID problem. This demonstrates Hetero-EUCLID framework's applicability in Digital Image/Volume Correlation-based experimental scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed framework performs successful segmentation and material characterizations based on data from a single experiment, thereby making it viable for rapid, interpretable model discovery in domains such as aerospace and defense composites and for characterization of selective tissue stiffening in medical conditions such as fibroatheroma, atherosclerosis, or cancer.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11784v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Pressure-Based Diffusion Model for Influence Maximization on Social Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12822</link><description>arXiv:2509.12822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, an individual's local social network carries significant influence over the opinions they form and subsequently propagate. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model -- the Pressure Threshold model (PT) -- for dynamically simulating the spread of influence through a social network. This model extends the popular Linear Threshold (LT) model by adjusting a node's outgoing influence in proportion to the influence it receives from its activated neighbors. We examine the Influence Maximization (IM) problem under this framework, which involves selecting seed nodes that yield maximal graph coverage after a diffusion process, and describe how the problem manifests under the PT model. Experiments on real-world networks, supported by enhancements to the open-source network-diffusion library CyNetDiff, reveal that the PT model identifies seed sets distinct from those chosen by LT. Furthermore, the analyses show that densely connected networks amplify pressure effects far more strongly than sparse networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.12822v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MINGLE: VLMs for Semantically Complex Region Detection in Urban Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13484</link><description>arXiv:2509.13484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is crucial for urban planning, informing the design of socially vibrant and inclusive environments. Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage of real-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.13484v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalizable Domain Adaptation for Sim-and-Real Policy Co-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18631</link><description>arXiv:2509.18631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior cloning has shown promise for robot manipulation, but real-world demonstrations are costly to acquire at scale. While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, particularly with advances in automated demonstration generation, transferring policies to the real world is hampered by various simulation and real domain gaps. In this work, we propose a unified sim-and-real co-training framework for learning generalizable manipulation policies that primarily leverages simulation and only requires a few real-world demonstrations. Central to our approach is learning a domain-invariant, task-relevant feature space. Our key insight is that aligning the joint distributions of observations and their corresponding actions across domains provides a richer signal than aligning observations (marginals) alone. We achieve this by embedding an Optimal Transport (OT)-inspired loss within the co-training framework, and extend this to an Unbalanced OT framework to handle the imbalance between abundant simulation data and limited real-world examples. We validate our method on challenging manipulation tasks, showing it can leverage abundant simulation data to achieve up to a 30% improvement in the real-world success rate and even generalize to scenarios seen only in simulation.

Abstract: We propose a novel symbolic control framework for enforcing temporal logic specifications in Euler-Lagrange systems that addresses the key limitations of traditional abstraction-based approaches. Unlike existing methods that require exact system models and provide guarantees only at discrete sampling instants, our approach relies only on bounds on system parameters and input constraints, and ensures correctness for the full continuous-time trajectory. The framework combines scalable abstraction of a simplified virtual system with a closed-form, model-free controller that guarantees trajectories satisfy the original specification while respecting input bounds and remaining robust to unknown but bounded disturbances. We provide feasibility conditions for the construction of confinement regions and analyze the trade-off between efficiency and conservatism. Case studies on pendulum dynamics, a two-link manipulator, and multi-agent systems, including hardware experiments, demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures both correctness and safety while significantly reducing computational time and memory requirements. These results highlight its scalability and practicality for real-world robotic systems where precise models are unavailable and continuous-time guarantees are essential.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19859v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid RIS-Aided Digital Over-the-Air Computing for Edge AI Inference: Joint Feature Quantization and Active-Passive Beamforming Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21201</link><description>arXiv:2509.21201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vision of 6G networks aims to enable edge inference by leveraging ubiquitously deployed artificial intelligence (AI) models, facilitating intelligent environmental perception for a wide range of applications. A critical operation in edge inference is for an edge node (EN) to aggregate multi-view sensory features extracted by distributed agents, thereby boosting perception accuracy. Over-the-air computing (AirComp) emerges as a promising technique for rapid feature aggregation by exploiting the waveform superposition property of analog-modulated signals, which is, however, incompatible with existing digital communication systems. Meanwhile, hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a novel RIS architecture capable of simultaneous signal amplification and reflection, exhibits potential for enhancing AirComp. Therefore, this paper proposes a Hybrid RIS-aided Digital AirComp (HRD-AirComp) scheme, which employs vector quantization to map high-dimensional features into discrete codewords that are digitally modulated into symbols for wireless transmission. By judiciously adjusting the AirComp transceivers and hybrid RIS reflection to control signal superposition across agents, the EN can estimate the aggregated features from the received signals. To endow HRD-AirComp with a task-oriented design principle, we derive a surrogate function for inference accuracy that characterizes the impact of feature quantization and over-the-air aggregation. Based on this surrogate, we formulate an optimization problem targeting inference accuracy maximization, and develop an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the quantization bit allocation, agent transmission coefficients, EN receiving beamforming, and hybrid RIS reflection beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HRD-AirComp outperforms baselines in terms of both inference accuracy and uncertainty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21201v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Teaching Transformers to Solve Combinatorial Problems through Efficient Trial &amp; Error</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22023</link><description>arXiv:2509.22023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel trial &amp; error approach for solving problems in the class NP, where candidate solutions are iteratively generated and efficiently validated using verifiers. We focus on the paradigmatic task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99%) compared to prior neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures, our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning, we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. This is achieved using depth-1 guessing, showing empirically that almost all Sudoku can be solved using the puzzle's rules with at most one guess. We provide a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and stochastic optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22023v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TetriServe: Efficient DiT Serving for Heterogeneous Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01565</link><description>arXiv:2510.01565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating high-quality images through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost, particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically adjust the degree of parallelism of individual requests according to their deadlines. We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2) adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and (3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01565v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Less LLM, More Documents: Searching for Improved RAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02657</link><description>arXiv:2510.02657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples document retrieval with large language models (LLMs). While scaling generators often improves accuracy, it also increases inference and deployment overhead. We study an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus, and how it trades off with generator scale. Across multiple open-domain QA benchmarks, corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can in many cases match the gains of moving to a larger model tier, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and very large models benefit less. Our analysis suggests that these improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. Overall, our results characterize a corpus-generator trade-off in RAG and provide empirical guidance on how corpus scale and model capacity interact in this setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02657v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Curious Case of In-Training Compression of State Space Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02823</link><description>arXiv:2510.02823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis, provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs \emph{during training}, where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our approach, \textsc{CompreSSM}, applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units, but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity, with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher performance.

Abstract: Neural diffusion processes provide a scalable, non-Gaussian approach to modelling distributions over functions, but existing formulations are limited to single-task inference and do not capture dependencies across related tasks. In many multi-task regression settings, jointly modelling correlated functions and enabling task-aware conditioning is crucial for improving predictive performance and uncertainty calibration, particularly in low-data regimes. We propose multi-task neural diffusion processes, an extension that incorporates a task encoder to enable task-conditioned probabilistic regression and few-shot adaptation across related functions. The task encoder extracts a low-dimensional representation from context observations and conditions the diffusion model on this representation, allowing information sharing across tasks while preserving input-size agnosticity and the equivariance properties of neural diffusion processes. The resulting framework retains the expressiveness and scalability of neural diffusion processes while enabling efficient transfer to unseen tasks. Empirical results demonstrate improved point prediction accuracy and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty compared to single-task neural diffusion processes and Gaussian process baselines. We validate the approach on real wind farm data appropriate for wind power prediction. In this high-impact application, reliable uncertainty quantification directly supports operational decision-making in wind farm management, illustrating effective few-shot adaptation in a challenging real-world multi-task regression setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03419v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedReflect: Teaching Medical LLMs to Self-Improve via Reflective Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03687</link><description>arXiv:2510.03687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical problem-solving demands expert knowledge and intricate reasoning. Recent studies of large language models (LLMs) attempt to ease this complexity by introducing external knowledge verification through retrieval-augmented generation or by training on reasoning datasets. However, these approaches suffer from drawbacks such as retrieval overhead and high annotation costs, and they heavily rely on substituted external assistants to reach limited performance in medical field. In this paper, we introduce MedReflect, a generalizable framework designed to inspire LLMs with a physician-like reflective thinking mode. MedReflect generates a single-pass reflection chain that includes initial hypothesis generation, self-questioning, self-answering and decision refinement. This self-verified and self-reflective nature releases large language model's latent capability in medical problem-solving without external retrieval or heavy annotation. We demonstrate that MedReflect enables cost-efficient medical dataset construction. With only a minimal subset of randomly sampled training examples and lightweight fine-tuning, this approach achieves notable absolute accuracy improvements across a series of medical benchmarks while significantly cutting annotation requirements. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can learn to solve specialized medical problems via self-reflection and self-improvement, reducing reliance on external supervision and extensive task-specific fine-tuning data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03687v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring the Challenge and Value of Deep Learning in Automated Skin Disease Diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03869</link><description>arXiv:2510.03869v2 Announce Type: replace

Deep learning (DL) has shown significant promise in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of automated skin disease diagnosis, particularly in detecting and classifying skin lesions. However, several challenges remain for DL-based skin cancer diagnosis, including complex features, image noise, intra-class variation, inter-class similarity, and data imbalance. This review synthesizes recent research and discusses innovative approaches to address these challenges, such as data augmentation, hybrid models, and feature fusion. Furthermore, the review highlights the integration of DL models into clinical workflows, offering insights into the potential of deep learning to revolutionize skin disease diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making. This review uniquely integrates a PRISMA-based methodology with a challenge-oriented taxonomy, providing a systematic and transparent synthesis of recent deep learning advances for skin disease diagnosis. It further highlights emerging directions such as hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures and uncertainty-aware models, emphasizing its contribution to future dermatological AI research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03869v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MADIAVE: Multi-Agent Debate for Implicit Attribute Value Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05611</link><description>arXiv:2510.05611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately representing products in e-commerce, as it infers latent attributes from multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce MADIAVE, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds, agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in multimodal e-commerce.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05611v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Communication Enables Cooperation in LLM Agents: A Comparison with Curriculum-Based Approaches</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05748</link><description>arXiv:2510.05748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game with Punishment, demonstrating that optimizing for short-term rationality can actively undermine alignment goals. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons embedded in game sequences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05748v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved Streaming Algorithm for Fair $k$-Center Clustering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05937</link><description>arXiv:2510.05937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world applications pose challenges in incorporating fairness constraints into the $k$-center clustering problem, where the dataset consists of $m$ demographic groups, each with a specified upper bound on the number of centers to ensure fairness. Focusing on big data scenarios, this paper addresses the problem in a streaming setting, where data points arrive one by one sequentially in a continuous stream. Leveraging a structure called the $\lambda$-independent center set, we propose a one-pass streaming algorithm that first computes a reserved set of points during the streaming process. Then, for the post-streaming process, we propose an approach for selecting centers from the reserved point set by analyzing all three possible cases, transforming the most complicated one into a specially constrained vertex cover problem in an auxiliary graph. Our algorithm achieves a tight approximation ratio of 5 while consuming $O(k\log n)$ memory. It can also be readily adapted to solve the offline fair $k$-center problem, achieving a 3-approximation ratio that matches the current state of the art. Furthermore, we extend our approach to a semi-structured data stream, where data points from each group arrive in batches. In this setting, we present a 3-approximation algorithm for $m = 2$ and a 4-approximation algorithm for general $m$. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our approaches, demonstrating that they outperform existing baselines in both clustering cost and runtime efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05937v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beneficial Reasoning Behaviors in Agentic Search and Effective Post-training to Obtain Them</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06534</link><description>arXiv:2510.06534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic search requires large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step search to solve complex information-seeking tasks, imposing unique challenges on their reasoning capabilities. However, what constitutes effective reasoning for agentic search and how it can be learned remains unclear. In this work, we first investigate the reasoning behaviors that enable success in agentic search. By comparing successful and failed trajectories via an LLM-based analysis pipeline, we identify four beneficial behaviors: Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error Recovery. Building on this, we propose Behavior Priming, a training approach that equips agentic search models with these reasoning behaviors before reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, it first performs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on collected trajectories exhibiting the identified behaviors to cultivate these behaviors, and then applies standard RL to further improve task performance. Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B and Llama3.2-3B-Instruct show that Behavior Priming yields relative improvements over direct RL by 37.2\% on three web benchmarks and 6.2\% on seven multi-hop QA benchmarks, and outperforms the SFT-then-RL baseline using outcome-correct trajectories for fine-tuning. Crucially, we show that these reasoning behaviors matter more than outcome correctness in the priming stage prior to RL. Further analysis reveals that Behavior Priming enhances exploration (pass@8) and test-time scaling (search step number), providing a robust foundation for RL. Our code are avalible at https://github.com/cxcscmu/Behavior-Priming-for-Agentic-Search.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06534v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emergent Misalignment via In-Context Learning: Narrow in-context examples can produce broadly misaligned LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11288</link><description>arXiv:2510.11288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across four model families (Gemini, Kimi-K2, Grok, and Qwen), narrow in-context examples cause models to produce misaligned responses to benign, unrelated queries. With 16 in-context examples, EM rates range from 1\% to 24\% depending on model and domain, appearing with as few as 2 examples. Neither larger model scale nor explicit reasoning provides reliable protection. We formulate and test a hypothesis, which explains in-context EM as conflict between safety objectives and context-following behavior. Consistent with this, instructing models to prioritize safety reduces EM while prioritizing context-following increases it. These findings establish ICL as a previously underappreciated vector for emergent misalignment that operates without parameter modification and resists simple scaling-based solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11288v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Noise to Signal to Selbstzweck: Reframing Human Label Variation in the Era of Post-training in NLP</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12817</link><description>arXiv:2510.12817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation that reflects the diversity of human perspectives rather than mere error. Long treated in NLP as noise to be eliminated, HLV has only recently been reframed as a signal for improving model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and post-training methods such as human feedback-based alignment, the role of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning datasets routinely collapse multiple annotations into a single label, flattening diverse perspectives into artificial consensus. Preserving HLV is necessary not only for pluralistic alignment but also for sociotechnical safety evaluation, where model behavior must be assessed in relation to human interaction and societal context. This position paper argues that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck, an intrinsic value in itself. We analyze the limitations of existing preference datasets and propose actionable strategies for incorporating HLV into dataset construction to better preserve pluralistic human values.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.12817v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Power to the Clients: Federated Learning in a Dictatorship Setting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22149</link><description>arXiv:2510.22149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22149v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PerCoR: Evaluating Commonsense Reasoning in Persian via Multiple-Choice Sentence Completion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22616</link><description>arXiv:2510.22616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news, cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%). The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human solvability.

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce \algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB} ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\; (K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases: (i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how \algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited resources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22654v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Test-Time Tuned Language Models Enable End-to-end De Novo Molecular Structure Generation from MS/MS Spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23746</link><description>arXiv:2510.23746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry is a cornerstone technique for identifying unknown small molecules in fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and environmental analysis. However, certain aspects, such as the probabilistic fragmentation process and size of the chemical space, make structure elucidation from such spectra highly challenging, particularly when there is a shift between the deployment and training conditions. Current methods rely on database matching of previously observed spectra of known molecules and multi-step pipelines that require intermediate fingerprint prediction or expensive fragment annotations. We introduce a novel end-to-end framework based on a transformer model that directly generates molecular structures from an input tandem mass spectrum and its corresponding molecular formula, thereby eliminating the need for manual annotations and intermediate steps, while leveraging transfer learning from simulated data. To further address the challenge of out-of-distribution spectra, we introduce a test-time tuning strategy that dynamically adapts the pre-trained model to novel experimental data. Our approach achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 3.16% on the MassSpecGym benchmark and 12.88% on the NPLIB1 datasets, considerably outperforming conventional fine-tuning. Baseline approaches are also surpassed by 27% and 67% respectively. Even when the exact reference structure is not recovered, the generated candidates are chemically informative, exhibiting high structural plausibility as reflected by strong Tanimoto similarity to the ground truth. Notably, we observe a relative improvement in average Tanimoto similarity of 83% on NPLIB1 and 64% on MassSpecGym compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our framework combines simplicity with adaptability, generating accurate molecular candidates that offer valuable guidance for expert interpretation of unseen spectra.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23746v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dual-Scale Antenna Deployment for Pinching Antenna Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27185</link><description>arXiv:2510.27185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dual-scale deployment (DSD) framework is proposed for pinching antenna systems (PASS), under which four protocols are provided. 1) For the coarse-scale deployment, the pinching antenna (PA) is transferred over a large-scale range at the waveguide level. 2) For the fine-scale deployment, the PA is adjusted with high precision within a small-scale region. By simultaneously optimizing both scales, the proposed DSD framework can unleash the full potential of PA deployment, while maintaining low computational complexity. Based on this framework, we establish a practical power consumption model and derive theoretical energy efficiency expressions for PASS. Then, an energy-efficiency maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit precoding, PA radiation power, and dual-scale PA deployment. To solve this non-convex, highly coupled problem, a low-complexity penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of theoretical results and the convergence of the proposed algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed DSD framework is highly effective for PASS, delivering about $70\%$ higher energy efficiency than the conventional cell-free architecture and nearly a \emph{twofold} improvement relative to MIMO systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.27185v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Making Democracy Work: Fixing and Simplifying Egalitarian Paxos (Extended Version)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02743</link><description>arXiv:2511.02743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical state-machine replication protocols, such as Paxos, rely on a distinguished leader process to order commands. Unfortunately, this approach makes the leader a single point of failure and increases the latency for clients that are not co-located with it. As a response to these drawbacks, Egalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows replicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader allows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of any processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any process to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more than $e = \lceil\frac{f+1}{2}\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently submitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in practical systems.
  Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication protocols. But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously specified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos* -- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical contribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously proved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the whole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \ge \max\{2e+f-1, 2f+1\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.02743v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Aligning Multimodal LLMs with Human Experts: A Focus on Parent-Child Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04366</link><description>arXiv:2511.04366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting approach, separating observation from judgement. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04366v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Implicit Aggregation: Robust Image Representation for Place Recognition in the Transformer Era</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06024</link><description>arXiv:2511.06024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically regarded as a specific image retrieval task, whose core lies in representing images as global descriptors. Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

Abstract: Infographics are widely used in social media to convey complex information, yet how they influence users' affects remains underexplored due to the scarcity of relevant datasets.

After that, we constructed an Affect Table to constrain annotation. We used five state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze both modalities, and their outputs were fused with the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm to yield robust affects and confidences. We conducted a user study with two experiments to validate usability and assess the InfoAffect dataset using the Composite Affect Consistency Index (CACI), achieving an overall score of 0.608, which indicates high accuracy.

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers are operated by proprietary code dialects; this makes it challenging to train coding assistants. Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09122v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sim4IA-Bench: A User Simulation Benchmark Suite for Next Query and Utterance Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09329</link><description>arXiv:2511.09329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Validating user simulation is a difficult task due to the lack of established measures and benchmarks, which makes it challenging to assess whether a simulator accurately reflects real user behavior. As part of the Sim4IA Micro-Shared Task at the Sim4IA Workshop, SIGIR 2025, we present Sim4IA-Bench, a simulation benchmark suit for the prediction of the next queries and utterances, the first of its kind in the IR community. Our dataset as part of the suite comprises 160 real-world search sessions from the CORE search engine. For 70 of these sessions, up to 62 simulator runs are available, divided into Task A and Task B, in which different approaches predicted users next search queries or utterances. Sim4IA-Bench provides a basis for evaluating and comparing user simulation approaches and for developing new measures of simulator validity. Although modest in size, the suite represents the first publicly available benchmark that links real search sessions with simulated next-query predictions. In addition to serving as a testbed for next query prediction, it also enables exploratory studies on query reformulation behavior, intent drift, and interaction-aware retrieval evaluation. We also introduce a new measure for evaluating next-query predictions in this task. By making the suite publicly available, we aim to promote reproducible research and stimulate further work on realistic and explainable user simulation for information access: https://github.com/irgroup/Sim4IA-Bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09329v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Supporting Evidence for the Adaptive Feature Program across Diverse Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09425</link><description>arXiv:2511.09425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze feature learning, the characteristic property of neural networks, in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parameterized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several pieces of supporting evidence for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09425v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Echoing: Identity Failures when LLM Agents Talk to Each Other</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09710</link><description>arXiv:2511.09710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $66$ AxA configurations, $4$ domains (3 transactional, 1 advisory), and $2500+$ conversations (over $250000$ LLM inferences), we show that echoing occurs across major LLM providers, with echoing rates as high as $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ agent turns) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal experiment design. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation where targeted use of structured response reduces echoing to $9\%$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09710v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DemoTuner: Automatic Performance Tuning for Database Management Systems Based on Demonstration Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09998</link><description>arXiv:2511.09998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate that DemoTuner achieves performance gains of up to 44.01% for MySQL and 39.95% for PostgreSQL over default configurations. Compared with three representative baseline methods, DemoTuner is able to further reduce the execution time by up to 10.03%, while always consuming the least online tuning cost. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09998v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Collaborative Representation Learning for Alignment of Tactile, Language, and Vision Modalities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11512</link><description>arXiv:2511.11512v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11512v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Better LLM Reasoning via Dual-Play</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11881</link><description>arXiv:2511.11881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet still rely heavily on external supervision (e.g., curated labels). Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training. Experimental results show that PasoDoble can improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our project page is available at https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11881v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15304</link><description>arXiv:2511.15304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for Large Language Models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.15304v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817</link><description>arXiv:2511.15817v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code.
  This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.15817v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aggregating Direct and Indirect Neighbors through Graph Linear Transformations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16871</link><description>arXiv:2511.16871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) typically rely on localized message passing, requiring increasing depth to capture long range dependencies. In this work, we introduce Graph Linear Transformations, a linear transformation that realizes direct and indirect feature mixing on graphs through a single, well-defined linear operator derived from the graph structure. By interpreting graphs as walk-summable Gaussian graphical models, we compute these transformations via Gaussian Belief Propagation, enabling each node to aggregate information from both direct and indirect neighbors without explicit enumeration of multi-hop paths. We show that different constructions of the underlying precision matrix induce distinct and interpretable propagation biases, ranging from selective edge-level interactions to uniform structural smoothing, and that Graph Linear Transformations can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to both local message-passing GNNs and dynamic neighborhood aggregation models across homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16871v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating perturbation robustness of generative systems that use COBOL code inputs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18488</link><description>arXiv:2511.18488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems incorporating large language models (LLMs) as a component are known to be sensitive (i.e., non-robust) to minor input variations that do not change the meaning of the input; such sensitivity may reduce the system's usefulness. Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation. These tools can be further used to improve the system by, for instance, indicating variations that should be handled by pre-processing steps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18488v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Periodic Asynchrony: An On-Policy Approach for Accelerating LLM Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18871</link><description>arXiv:2511.18871v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the GRPO algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention, with growing efforts to reproduce and apply it. However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, our approach consistently delivers significant end-to-end training efficiency improvements on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18871v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ModHiFi: Identifying High Fidelity predictive components for Model Modification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19566</link><description>arXiv:2511.19566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open weight models, which are ubiquitous, rarely provide access to their training data or loss function. This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning, which are constrained by this unavailability, an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components based on their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we utilize to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires neither training data nor access to a loss function. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11\% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models. ModHiFi-U, for classwise unlearning, achieves complete unlearning on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning and demonstrates competitive performance on Swin Transformers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.19566v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-Shot Transfer Capabilities of the Sundial Foundation Model for Leaf Area Index Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20004</link><description>arXiv:2511.20004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the zero-shot forecasting capability of time series foundation models for Leaf Area Index (LAI) forecasting in agricultural monitoring.

We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. We show that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.20004v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Co-Evolving Agents: Learning from Failures as Hard Negatives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22254</link><description>arXiv:2511.22254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress of large foundation models has accelerated the development of task-specialized agents across diverse domains. However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.22254v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reconstructing Multi-Scale Physical Fields from Extremely Sparse Measurements with an Autoencoder-Diffusion Cascade</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01572</link><description>arXiv:2512.01572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements constitutes a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem, in which deterministic end-to-end mappings often break down due to intrinsic non-uniqueness and uncertainty. Rather than treating sparse reconstruction as a regression task, we recast it as a hierarchical probabilistic inference problem, where uncertainty is explicitly represented, structured, and progressively resolved. From this perspective, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing) as a general reconstruction paradigm for multi-scale physical fields under extreme data sparsity. Central to this paradigm is the introduction of an explicit intermediate representation that decomposes the original ill-posed problem into two substantially better-conditioned subproblems. First, a lightweight neural-operator-based functional autoencoder infers a coarse-scale approximation of the target field from sparse observations acting as an explicit intermediate variable. Rather than modeling multiple scales jointly, this intermediate estimate is deterministically fixed and subsequently used as the sole conditioning input to a conditional diffusion model that generates refined-scale details, yielding a cascaded inference structure with clearly separated reconstruction responsibilities. To ensure robustness under diverse sensing patterns, the diffusion model is trained using a mask-cascade strategy, which exposes it to a distribution of imperfect conditioning structures induced by extreme sparsity. During inference, measurement consistency is enforced through manifold-constrained gradients within a Bayesian posterior framework, ensuring fidelity to sparse observations while preserving data manifold coherence. This cascaded probabilistic formulation substantially alleviates ill-posedness, enabling accurate and stable reconstructions even under extreme sparsity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01572v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Observation Lakehouses: Living, Interactive Archives of Software Behavior</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02795</link><description>arXiv:2512.02795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code-generating LLMs are trained largely on static artifacts (source, comments, specifications) and rarely on materializations of run-time behavior. As a result, they readily internalize buggy or mislabeled code. Since non-trivial semantic properties are undecidable in general, the only practical way to obtain ground-truth functionality is by dynamic observation of executions. In prior work, we addressed representation with Sequence Sheets, Stimulus-Response Matrices (SRMs), and Stimulus-Response Cubes (SRCs) to capture and compare behavior across tests, implementations, and contexts. These structures make observation data analyzable offline and reusable, but they do not by themselves provide persistence, evolution, or interactive analytics at scale. In this paper, therefore, we introduce observation lakehouses that operationalize continual SRCs: a tall, append-only observations table storing every actuation (stimulus, response, context) and SQL queries that materialize SRC slices on demand. Built on Apache Parquet + Iceberg + DuckDB, the lakehouse ingests data from controlled pipelines (LASSO) and CI pipelines (e.g., unit test executions), enabling n-version assessment, behavioral clustering, and consensus oracles without re-execution. On a 509-problem benchmark, we ingest $\approx$8.6M observation rows ($&lt;$51MiB) and reconstruct SRM/SRC views and clusters in $&lt;$100ms on a laptop, demonstrating that continual behavior mining is practical without a distributed cluster of machines. This makes behavioral ground truth first-class alongside other run-time data and provides an infrastructure path toward behavior-aware evaluation and training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated superior performance in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). However, this accuracy-oriented learning paradigm often suffers from entropy collapse, which reduces policy exploration and limits reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning framework that leverages entropy signals at both the semantic and token levels to improve reasoning. From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens. By jointly optimizing data organization and algorithmic design, our method effectively mitigates entropy collapse and enhances LLM reasoning. Experimental results across 6 benchmarks with 3 different parameter-scale base models demonstrate that our method outperforms other entropy-based approaches in improving reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.04359v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UserSimCRS v2: Simulation-Based Evaluation for Conversational Recommender Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04588</link><description>arXiv:2512.04588v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10110v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Designing AI-Resilient Assessments Using Interconnected Problems: A Theoretically Grounded and Empirically Validated Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10758</link><description>arXiv:2512.10758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI has undermined traditional modular assessments in computing education, creating a disconnect between academic evaluation and industry practice. This paper presents a theoretically grounded framework for designing AI-resilient assessments, supported by formal analysis and multi-year empirical validation.
  We make three contributions. First, we establish two theoretical results: (1) assessments composed of interconnected problems, where outputs feed into subsequent stages, are more AI-resilient than modular assessments because current language models struggle with sustained multi-step reasoning and context; and (2) semi-structured problems with deterministic success criteria provide more reliable measures of student competency than fully open-ended projects, which allow AI systems to default to familiar solution patterns. These results challenge common policy and institutional guidance that promotes open-ended assessments as the primary safeguard for academic integrity.
  Second, we validate these results using data from four university data science courses (N = 138). While students achieve near-perfect scores on AI-assisted modular homework, performance drops by roughly 30 percentage points on proctored exams, indicating substantial AI score inflation. Interconnected projects remain strongly correlated with modular assessments, suggesting they measure the same underlying skills while resisting AI misuse. Proctored exams show weaker alignment, implying they may assess test-taking ability rather than intended learning outcomes.
  Third, we translate these findings into a practical assessment design framework. The proposed approach enables educators to create assessments that promote integrative thinking, reflect real-world AI-augmented workflows, and naturally resist trivial delegation to generative AI, thereby helping restore academic integrity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10758v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Computational emotion analysis with multimodal LLMs: Current evidence on an emerging methodological opportunity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10882</link><description>arXiv:2512.10882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze emotions in political communication. Multimodal large language models (mLLMs) promise to enable such analyses through in-context learning. However, we lack systematic evidence on whether these models can reliably measure emotions in real-world political settings. This paper evaluates leading mLLMs for video-based emotional arousal measurement using two complementary human-labeled video datasets: recordings created under laboratory conditions and real-world parliamentary debates. I find a critical lab-vs-field performance gap. In video created under laboratory conditions, mLLMs arousal scores approach human-level reliability with little to no demographic bias. However, in parliamentary debate recordings, all examined models' arousal scores correlate at best moderately with average human ratings and exhibit systematic bias by speaker gender and age. Neither relying on leading closed-source mLLMs nor computational noise mitigation strategies change this finding. Further, mLLMs underperform even in sentiment analysis when using video recordings instead of text transcripts of the same speeches. These findings reveal important limitations of current mLLMs for real-world political video analysis and establish a rigorous evaluation framework for tracking future developments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10882v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SENSE: Self-Supervised Neural Embeddings for Spatial Ensembles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11145</link><description>arXiv:2512.11145v2 Announce Type: replace

This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features. Experiments on two scientific ensemble datasets - channel structures in soil derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and droplet-on-film impact dynamics - show that models incorporating clustering or contrastive loss marginally outperform the baseline approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11145v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mistake Notebook Learning: Batch-Clustered Failures for Training-Free Agent Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11485</link><description>arXiv:2512.11485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in persistent, real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks and inevitable failures. A key limitation, however, is their inability to systematically learn from these mistakes, forcing them to repeat identical errors in similar contexts. Unlike prior training-free methods that primarily store raw instance-level experience or focus on retrieving successful trajectories, we propose Mistake Notebook Learning (MNL), a novel memory framework that enables agents to self-curate generalizable guidance from batch-clustered failures. This mechanism allows agents to distill shared error patterns into structured "mistake notes," updating an external memory only when batch performance improves to ensure stability. To further amplify adaptability, we integrate MNL with test-time scaling, leveraging aggregated failure patterns to actively steer the search process away from known pitfalls. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, Text-to-SQL, and interactive agent benchmarks show that MNL achieves competitive performance compared to existing memory mechanisms and in-context methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. These findings position structured mistake abstraction as a critical lever for robust agent evolution, enabling continuous improvement without the cost of parameter updates.

Abstract: Benchmarking 3D spatial understanding of foundation models is essential for real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. Existing evaluations often rely on downstream fine-tuning with linear heads or task-specific decoders, making it difficult to isolate the intrinsic 3D reasoning ability of pre-trained encoders. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark for in-context 3D scene understanding that requires no fine-tuning and directly probes the quality of dense visual features. Building on the Hummingbird framework, which evaluates in-context 2D scene understanding, we extend the setup to the 3D Multi-View ImageNet (MVImgNet) dataset. Given a set of images depicting objects at specific camera angles (keys), we benchmark the performance of segmenting novel views (queries) and report the scores in 4 categories of easy, medium, hard, and extreme based on the key-query view contrast. We benchmark 7 state-of-the-art foundation models and show that DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ToyeshC/open-hummingbird-3d-eval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11574v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable IP Mimicry: End-to-End Deceptive IP Blending to Overcome Rectification and Scale Limitations of IP Camouflage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12061</link><description>arXiv:2512.12061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor intellectual property (IP) theft incurs estimated annual losses ranging from $225 billion to $600 billion. Despite initiatives like the CHIPS Act, many semiconductor designs remain vulnerable to reverse engineering (RE). IP Camouflage is a recent breakthrough that expands beyond the logic gate hiding of traditional camouflage through "mimetic deception," where an entire module masquerades as a different IP. However, it faces key limitations: requires a high-overhead post-generation rectification step, is not easily scalable, and uses an AIG logic representation that is mismatched with standard RE analysis flows. This paper addresses these shortcommings by introducing two novel, end-to-end models. We propose a Graph-Matching algorithm to solve the representation problem and a DNAS-based NAND Array model to achieve scalability. To facilitate this, we also introduce a mimicry-aware partitioning method, enabling a divide-and-conquer approach for large-scale designs. Our results demonstrate that these models are resilient to SAT and GNN-RE attacks, providing efficient and scalable paths for end-to-end deceptive IP design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12061v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14350</link><description>arXiv:2512.14350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.14350v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Good is Post-Hoc Watermarking With Language Model Rephrasing?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16904</link><description>arXiv:2512.16904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generation-time text watermarking embeds statistical signals into text for traceability of AI-generated content. We explore *post-hoc watermarking* where an LLM rewrites existing text while applying generation-time watermarking, to protect copyrighted documents, or detect their use in training or RAG via watermark radioactivity. Unlike generation-time approaches, which is constrained by how LLMs are served, this setting offers additional degrees of freedom for both generation and detection. We investigate how allocating compute (through larger rephrasing models, beam search, multi-candidate generation, or entropy filtering at detection) affects the quality-detectability trade-off. Our strategies achieve strong detectability and semantic fidelity on open-ended text such as books. Among our findings, the simple Gumbel-max scheme surprisingly outperforms more recent alternatives under nucleus sampling, and most methods benefit significantly from beam search. However, most approaches struggle when watermarking verifiable text such as code, where we counterintuitively find that smaller models outperform larger ones. This study reveals both the potential and limitations of post-hoc watermarking, laying groundwork for practical applications and future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16904v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Linear Personality Probing and Steering in LLMs: A Big Five Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17639</link><description>arXiv:2512.17639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit distinct and consistent personalities that greatly impact trust and engagement. While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17639v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DEER: A Benchmark for Evaluating Deep Research Agents on Expert Report Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17776</link><description>arXiv:2512.17776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models advance, deep research systems capable of generating expert-level reports through multi-step reasoning and evidence-based synthesis are emerging. However, evaluating such reports remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often lack systematic evaluation criteria, rely heavily on LLM-based judges that may miss issues requiring expert judgment, and verify only a limited subset of explicitly cited statements rather than report-wide factual reliability. To address these limitations, we introduce DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks spanning 13 domains, along with an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy with seven dimensions and 25 subdimensions, operationalized into 101 fine-grained rubric items. To improve evaluation consistency, DEER provides task-specific Expert Evaluation Guidance to support LLM-based judging. Complementing rubric-based assessment, we propose a document-level fact-checking architecture that verifies both cited and uncited claims and quantifies the quality and reliability of the supporting evidence. Experimental results show that DEER exhibits strong correlation with human expert judgments and yields interpretable diagnostics of system strengths and weaknesses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17776v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Drives Issue Resolution Speed?

Abstract: Scientific Workflow Systems (SWSs) play a vital role in enabling reproducible, scalable, and automated scientific analysis. Like other open-source software, these systems depend on active maintenance and community engagement to remain reliable and sustainable. However, despite the importance of timely issue resolution for software quality and community trust, little is known about what drives issue resolution speed within SWSs. This paper presents an empirical study of issue management and resolution across a collection of GitHub-hosted SWS projects. We analyze 21,116 issues to investigate how project characteristics, issue metadata, and contributor interactions affect time-to-close. Specifically, we address two research questions: (1) how issues are managed and addressed in SWSs, and (2) how issue and contributor features relate to issue resolution speed. We find that 68.91% of issues are closed, with half of them resolved within 18.09 days. Our results show that although SWS projects follow structured issue management practices, the issue resolution speed varies considerably across systems. Factors such as labeling and assigning issues are associated with faster issue resolution. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for developers to better manage SWS repository issues and improve their quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18852v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LeLaR: The First In-Orbit Demonstration of an AI-Based Satellite Attitude Controller</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19576</link><description>arXiv:2512.19576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universit\"at W\"urzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universit\"at Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19576v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Isolated Investor: Predicting Startup Success via Roleplay-Based Collective Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22608</link><description>arXiv:2512.22608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22608v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predictive Modeling of Power Outages during Extreme Events: Integrating Weather and Socio-Economic Factors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22699</link><description>arXiv:2512.22699v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic and information-dense modality: video. In this paper, we first formalize the task of Agentic Video Browsing and introduce Video-BrowseComp, a benchmark evaluating open-ended agentic browsing tasks that enforce a mandatory dependency on videos. We observe that current paradigms struggle to reconcile the scale of open-ended video exploration with the need for fine-grained visual verification. Direct visual inference (e.g., RAG) maximizes perception but incurs prohibitive context costs, while text-centric summarization optimizes efficiency but often misses critical visual details required for accurate grounding. To address this, we propose Video-Browser, a novel agent leveraging Pyramidal Perception, filtering with cheap metadata and zooming in with expensive visual perception only when necessary. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a 37.5% relative improvement while reducing token consumption by 58.3% compared to Direct visual inference, establishing a foundation for verifiable open-web video research.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for future wireless networks by prioritizing task-relevant meaning over raw data delivery, thereby reducing communication overhead and improving efficiency. However, shifting from bit-accurate transmission to task-oriented delivery introduces new security and privacy risks. These include semantic leakage, semantic manipulation, knowledge base vulnerabilities, model-related attacks, and threats to authenticity and availability. Most existing secure SemCom studies focus on analog SemCom, where semantic features are mapped to continuous channel inputs. In contrast, digital SemCom transmits semantic information through discrete bits or symbols within practical transceiver pipelines, offering stronger compatibility with realworld systems while exposing a distinct and underexplored attack surface. In particular, digital SemCom typically represents semantic information over a finite alphabet through explicit digital modulation, following two main routes: probabilistic modulation and deterministic modulation. These discrete mechanisms and practical transmission procedures introduce additional vulnerabilities affecting bit- or symbol-level semantic information, the modulation stage, and packet-based delivery and protocol operations. Motivated by these challenges and the lack of a systematic analysis of secure digital SemCom, this paper provides a structured review of the area. Specifically, we review SemCom fundamentals and clarify the architectural differences between analog and digital SemCom. We then summarize threats shared by both paradigms and organize the threat landscape specific to digital SemCom, followed by a discussion of potential defenses. Finally, we outline open research directions toward secure and deployable digital SemCom systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24602v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian-Inspired Transformers for Population Diversity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25063</link><description>arXiv:2512.25063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are usually trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces a deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the analogy to human populations, in which population-level intelligence emerges from diverse individual behaviors, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which enable sampling diverse yet coherent transformer large language model instances (hereafter referred to as a 'mind') from a single pre-trained LLM. B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-inspired posterior proxy by injecting stochasticity directly into normalization layers, avoiding the prohibitive cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a population of minds with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. During the generation of each response, we sample a single realization from the random distribution and hold it fixed, ensuring temporal consistency and reasoning coherence. Experiments on zero-shot generation and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverages the stochastic model diversity, yielding superior response diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25063v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantifier Elimination Meets Treewidth</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00312</link><description>arXiv:2601.00312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the complexity barrier inherent in Fourier-Motzkin elimination (FME) and cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) when eliminating a block of (existential) quantifiers. To mitigate this, we propose exploiting structural sparsity in the variable dependency graph of quantified formulas. Utilizing tools from parameterized algorithms, we investigate the role of treewidth, a parameter that measures the graph's tree-likeness, in the process of quantifier elimination. A novel dynamic programming framework, structured over a tree decomposition of the dependency graph, is developed for applying FME and CAD, and is also extensible to general quantifier elimination procedures. Crucially, we prove that when the treewidth is a constant, the framework achieves a significant exponential complexity improvement for both FME and CAD, reducing the worst-case complexity bound from doubly exponential to single exponential. Preliminary experiments on sparse linear real arithmetic (LRA) and nonlinear real arithmetic (NRA) benchmarks confirm that our algorithm outperforms the existing popular heuristic-based approaches on instances exhibiting low treewidth.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00312v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entropy Production in Machine Learning Under Fokker-Planck Probability Flow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00554</link><description>arXiv:2601.00554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments inevitably experience performance degradation due to data drift. While numerous drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining decisions should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy-based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium statistical physics. Interpreting drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker-Planck equation, we quantify model-data mismatch using relative entropy and show that its time derivative admits an entropy-balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. Guided by this theory, we implement an entropy-triggered retraining policy using an exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) control statistic applied to a streaming kernel density estimator of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We evaluate this approach across multiple nonstationary data streams. In synthetic, financial, and web-traffic domains, entropy-based retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to frequent retraining while reducing retraining frequency by one to two orders of magnitude. However, in a challenging biomedical ECG setting, the entropy-based trigger underperforms the maximum-frequency baseline, highlighting limitations of feature-space entropy monitoring under complex label-conditional drift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00554v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust and Efficient Zeroth-Order LLM Fine-Tuning via Adaptive Bayesian Subspace Optimizer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01452</link><description>arXiv:2601.01452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with zeroth-order (ZO) optimization reduces memory by approximating gradients through function evaluations. However, existing methods essentially perform updates in a one-dimensional space, and suffer from collapse or substantial performance degradation under low-precision training. We introduce BSZO, an adaptive \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{S}ubspace \textbf{Z}eroth-Order \textbf{O}ptimizer, which applies Kalman filtering to combine finite-difference information across multiple perturbation directions within a subspace. By treating each finite-difference measurement as a noisy observation, BSZO builds a posterior distribution over the subspace-projected gradient and updates it through Bayesian inference, with a residual-based adaptive mechanism to adapt to noise variations. Theoretical analysis shows that BSZO improves the convergence rate by a factor of $k/\gamma$ compared to standard ZO methods. Experiments on RoBERTa, Mistral, and OPT models show that BSZO outperforms the baselines across various tasks, achieving up to 6.67\% absolute average improvement on OPT-13B while remaining robust under fp16/bf16 precision and keeping memory usage close to inference-only baselines (1.00$\times$--1.08$\times$ of MeZO).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01452v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FFP-300K: Scaling First-Frame Propagation for Generalizable Video Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01720</link><description>arXiv:2601.01720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-Frame Propagation (FFP) offers a promising paradigm for controllable video editing, but existing methods are hampered by a reliance on cumbersome run-time guidance. We identify the root cause of this limitation as the inadequacy of current training datasets, which are often too short, low-resolution, and lack the task diversity required to teach robust temporal priors. To address this foundational data gap, we first introduce FFP-300K, a new large-scale dataset comprising 300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p resolution and 81 frames in length, constructed via a principled two-track pipeline for diverse local and global edits. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework designed for true guidance-free FFP that resolves the critical tension between maintaining first-frame appearance and preserving source video motion. Architecturally, we introduce Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE), which dynamically remaps positional encodings to disentangle appearance and motion references. At the objective level, we employ a self-distillation strategy where an identity propagation task acts as a powerful regularizer, ensuring long-term temporal stability and preventing semantic drift. Comprehensive experiments on the EditVerseBench benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforming existing academic and commercial models by receiving about 0.2 PickScore and 0.3 VLM score improvement against these competitors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01720v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Meta-Learning Guided Pruning for Few-Shot Plant Pathology on Edge Devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02353</link><description>arXiv:2601.02353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in agricultural AI is deploying disease detection systems in remote fields with limited access to laboratories or high-performance computing (HPC) resources. While deep learning (DL) models, specifically deep convolutional networks, achieve high accuracy in identifying plant pathologies from leaf imagery, their memory footprints and computational demands limit edge deployment on devices constrained by battery life, processing power, and connectivity, such as Raspberry Pi. Few-shot learning (FSL) paradigms offer a compelling solution to the data scarcity problem inherent in agricultural applications, where obtaining labeled samples for novel disease variants proves both costly and time-sensitive. This work introduces a framework combining pruning with meta-learning for agricultural disease classification, addressing the tension between generalization capability and deployment feasibility. The proposed approach combines a novel Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS) mechanism with a three-stage Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline. Experiments on PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces model size by 78\% while maintaining 92.3\% of the original accuracy. The compressed model achieves 7 frames per second (FPS) on a Raspberry Pi 4, enabling practical real-time field diagnosis for smallholder farmers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02353v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VINO: A Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02358</link><description>arXiv:2601.02358v2 Announce Type: replace

Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02358v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-as-evaluator in Strategy Research: A Normative, Variance-Aware Protocol</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02370</link><description>arXiv:2601.02370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strategy researchers powerful tools for annotating text at scale, but treating LLM-generated labels as deterministic overlooks substantial instability. Grounded in content analysis and generalizability theory, we diagnose five variance sources: construct specification, interface effects, model preferences, output extraction, and system-level aggregation. Empirical demonstrations show that minor design choices-prompt phrasing, model selection-can shift outcomes by 12-85 percentage points. Such variance threatens not only reproducibility but econometric identification: annotation errors correlated with covariates bias parameter estimates regardless of average accuracy. We develop a variance-aware protocol specifying sampling budgets, aggregation rules, and reporting standards, and delineate scope conditions where LLM annotation should not be used. These contributions transform LLM-based annotation from ad hoc practice into auditable measurement infrastructure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02370v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Fourth-Order Cut-cell Multigrid Method for Solving Elliptic Equations on Arbitrary Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02975</link><description>arXiv:2601.02975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To numerically solve a generic elliptic equation on two-dimensional domains with rectangular Cartesian grids, we propose a cut-cell geometric multigrid method that features (1) general algorithmic steps that apply to two-dimensional constant-coefficient elliptic equations with both divergence and non-divergence forms and all types of boundary conditions, (2) the versatility of handling both regular and irregular domains with arbitrarily complex topology and geometry, (3) the fourth-order accuracy even at the presence of ${\cal C}^1$ discontinuities on the domain boundary, and (4) the optimal complexity of $O(h^{-2})$.Test results demonstrate the generality, accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and excellent conditioning of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02975v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs, You Can Evaluate It!

Abstract: Security operation centers (SOCs) often produce analysis reports on security incidents, and large language models (LLMs) will likely be used for this task in the near future. We postulate that a better understanding of how veteran analysts evaluate reports, including their feedback, can help produce analysis reports in SOCs. In this paper, we aim to leverage LLMs for analysis reports. To this end, we first construct a Analyst-wise checklist to reflect SOC practitioners' opinions for analysis report evaluation through literature review and user study with SOC practitioners. Next, we design a novel LLM-based conceptual framework, named MESSALA, by further introducing two new techniques, granularization guideline and multi-perspective evaluation. MESSALA can maximize report evaluation and provide feedback on veteran SOC practitioners' perceptions. When we conduct extensive experiments with MESSALA, the evaluation results by MESSALA are the closest to those of veteran SOC practitioners compared with the existing LLM-based methods. We then show two key insights. We also conduct qualitative analysis with MESSALA, and then identify that MESSALA can provide actionable items that are necessary for improving analysis reports.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03013v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Local Intrinsic Dimensionality of Ground Motion Data for Early Detection of Complex Catastrophic Slope Failure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03569</link><description>arXiv:2601.03569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03569v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Identification of a Kalman filter: consistency of local solutions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04198</link><description>arXiv:2601.04198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prediction error and maximum likelihood methods are powerful tools for identifying linear dynamical systems and, in particular, enable the joint estimation of model parameters and the Kalman filter used for state estimation. A key limitation, however, is that these methods require solving a generally non-convex optimization problem to global optimality. This paper analyzes the statistical behavior of local minimizers in the special case where only the Kalman gain is estimated. We prove that these local solutions are statistically consistent estimates of the true Kalman gain. This follows from asymptotic unimodality: as the dataset grows, the objective function converges to a limit with a unique local (and therefore global) minimizer. We further provide guidelines for designing the optimization problem for Kalman filter tuning and discuss extensions to the joint estimation of additional linear parameters and noise covariances. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using three examples of increasing complexity. The main practical takeaway of this paper is that difficulties caused by local minimizers in system identification are, at least, not attributable to the tuning of the Kalman gain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04198v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TSSR: Two-Stage Swap-Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Character-Level SMILES Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04521</link><description>arXiv:2601.04521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of reliable, valid, and diverse molecules is fundamental to modern drug discovery, as improved molecular generation supports efficient exploration of the chemical space for potential drug candidates and reduces the cost of early design efforts. Despite these needs, current chemical language models that generate molecules as SMILES strings are vulnerable to compounding token errors: many samples are unparseable or chemically implausible, and hard constraints meant to prevent failure can restrict exploration. To address this gap, we introduce TSSR, a Two-Stage, Swap-Reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework for character-level SMILES generation. Stage one rewards local token swaps that repair syntax, promoting transitions from invalid to parseable strings. Stage two provides chemistry-aware feedback from RDKit diagnostics, rewarding reductions in valence, aromaticity, and connectivity issues. The reward decomposes into interpretable terms (swap efficiency, error reduction, distance to validity), is model agnostic, and requires no task-specific labels or hand-crafted grammars. We evaluated TSSR on the MOSES benchmark using a GRU policy trained with PPO in both pure RL (P-RL) from random initialization and fine-tuning RL (F-RL) starting from a pretrained chemical language model, assessing 10,000 generated SMILES per run. In P-RL, TSSR significantly improves syntactic validity, chemical validity, and novelty. In F-RL, TSSR preserves drug-likeness and synthesizability while increasing validity and novelty. Token-level analysis shows that syntax edits and chemistry fixes act jointly to reduce RDKit detected errors. TSSR converts a sparse terminal objective into a denser and more interpretable reward, improving both syntactic and chemical quality without reducing diversity. TSSR is dataset-agnostic and can be adapted to various reinforcement learning approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04521v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 5G NR Non-Terrestrial Networks: From Early Results to the Road Ahead</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04882</link><description>arXiv:2601.04882v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Stock market price prediction is a significant interdisciplinary research domain that depends at the intersection of finance, statistics, and economics. Forecasting Accurately predicting stock prices has always been a focal point for various researchers. However, existing statistical approaches for time-series prediction often fail to effectively forecast the probability range of future stock prices. Hence, to solve this problem, the Neural Prophet with a Deep Neural Network (NP-DNN) is proposed to predict stock market prices. The preprocessing technique used in this research is Z-score normalization, which normalizes stock price data by removing scale differences, making patterns easier to detect. Missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, enhancing the models use of complete information for more accurate predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) learns complex nonlinear relationships among stock market prices and extracts hidden patterns from the input data, thereby creating meaningful feature representations for better prediction accuracy. The proposed NP-DNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.21% compared with other approaches using the Fused Large Language Model. Keywords: deep neural network, forecasting stock prices, multi-layer perceptron, neural prophet, stock market price prediction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05202v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Sparse Autoencoders Identify Reasoning Features in Language Models?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05679</link><description>arXiv:2601.05679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) identify genuine reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). We first show through a simple theoretical analysis that $\ell_1$-regularized SAEs are intrinsically biased toward low-dimensional patterns, providing a mechanistic explanation for why shallow linguistic cues may be preferentially captured over distributed reasoning behaviors. Motivated by this bias, we introduce a falsification-oriented evaluation framework that combines causal token injection and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that features identified by contrastive methods are highly sensitive to token-level interventions, with 45% to 90% activating when a small number of associated tokens are injected into non-reasoning text. For the remaining features, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields no improvements in benchmark performance. Overall, our results suggest that SAE features identified by current contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.

Abstract: The ability to automatically generate large-scale, interactive, and physically realistic 3D environments is crucial for advancing robotic learning and embodied intelligence. However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates structurally valid, semantically coherent, and functionally interactive environments across diverse scene types and conditions, enabling scalable embodied AI research. project page: https://anc891203.github.io/SceneFoundry-Demo/</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05810v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FACTUM: Mechanistic Detection of Citation Hallucination in Long-Form RAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05866</link><description>arXiv:2601.05866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are critically undermined by citation hallucinations, a deceptive failure where a model cites a source that fails to support its claim. While existing work attributes hallucination to a simple over-reliance on parametric knowledge, we reframe this failure as an evolving, scale-dependent coordination failure between the Attention (reading) and Feed-Forward Network (recalling) pathways. We introduce FACTUM (Framework for Attesting Citation Trustworthiness via Underlying Mechanisms), a framework of four mechanistic scores: Contextual Alignment (CAS), Attention Sink Usage (BAS), Parametric Force (PFS), and Pathway Alignment (PAS). Our analysis reveals that correct citations are consistently marked by higher parametric force (PFS) and greater use of the attention sink (BAS) for information synthesis. Crucially, we find that "one-size-fits-all" theories are insufficient as the signature of correctness evolves with scale: while the 3B model relies on high pathway alignment (PAS), our best-performing 8B detector identifies a shift toward a specialized strategy where pathways provide distinct, orthogonal information. By capturing this complex interplay, FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC. Our results demonstrate that high parametric force is constructive when successfully coordinated with the Attention pathway, paving the way for more nuanced and reliable RAG systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05866v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] iReasoner: Trajectory-Aware Intrinsic Reasoning Supervision for Self-Evolving Large Multimodal Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05877</link><description>arXiv:2601.05877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work shows that large multimodal models (LMMs) can self-improve from unlabeled data via self-play and intrinsic feedback. Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05877v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cascading multi-agent anomaly detection in surveillance systems via vision-language models and embedding-based classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06204</link><description>arXiv:2601.06204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent anomaly detection in dynamic visual environments requires reconciling real-time performance with semantic interpretability. Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling. The framework advances beyond conventional detection pipelines by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06204v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Incentive Mechanism Design for Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Blockchain Relayers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06699</link><description>arXiv:2601.06699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public blockchains, though renowned for their transparency and immutability, suffer from significant privacy concerns. Network-level analysis and long-term observation of publicly available transactions can often be used to infer user identities. To mitigate this, several blockchain applications rely on relayers, which serve as intermediary nodes between users and smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. However, dependence on a single relayer not only creates a single point of failure but also introduces exploitable vulnerabilities that weaken the system's privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a decentralized relayer architecture that enhances privacy and reliability through game-theoretic incentive design. We model the interaction among relayers as a non-cooperative game and design an incentive mechanism in which probabilistic uploading emerges as a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. Using evolutionary game analysis, we demonstrate the equilibrium's stability against perturbations and coordinated deviations. Through numerical evaluations, we analyze how equilibrium strategies and system behavior evolve with key parameters such as the number of relayers, upload costs, rewards, and penalties. In particular, we show that even with high transaction costs, the system maintains reliability with an outage probability below 0.05 . Furthermore, our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between privacy, reliability, robustness, and cost in decentralized relayer systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06699v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] V2P: Visual Attention Calibration for GUI Grounding via Background Suppression and Center Peaking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06899</link><description>arXiv:2601.06899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\% and 52.5\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro (see Fig.~\ref{fig:main_results_charts}). Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, underscoring V2P's generalizability in precise GUI grounding tasks and its potential for real-world deployment in future GUI agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06899v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UIKA: Fast Universal Head Avatar from Pose-Free Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07603</link><description>arXiv:2601.07603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present UIKA, a feed-forward animatable Gaussian head model from an arbitrary number of unposed inputs, including a single image, multi-view captures, and smartphone-captured videos. Unlike the traditional avatar method, which requires a studio-level multi-view capture system and reconstructs a human-specific model through a long-time optimization process, we rethink the task through the lenses of model representation, network design, and data preparation. First, we introduce a UV-guided avatar modeling strategy, in which each input image is associated with a pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation. Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views. To train our large avatar model, we additionally prepare a large-scale, identity-rich synthetic training dataset. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both monocular and multi-view settings.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning has emerged as a key paradigm to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with computational capabilities, yet integrating tool-use into long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of training data and the challenge of integrating tool-use without compromising the model's intrinsic long-chain reasoning. In this paper, we introduce DART (Discovery And Reinforcement of Tool-Integrated Reasoning Chains via Rollout Trees), a reinforcement learning framework that enables spontaneous tool-use during long CoT reasoning without human annotation. DART operates by constructing dynamic rollout trees during training to discover valid tool-use opportunities, branching out at promising positions to explore diverse tool-integrated trajectories. Subsequently, a tree-based process advantage estimation identifies and credits specific sub-trajectories where tool invocation positively contributes to the solution, effectively reinforcing these beneficial behaviors. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like AIME and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that DART significantly outperforms existing methods, successfully harmonizing tool execution with long CoT reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08274v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distribution Estimation with Side Information</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08535</link><description>arXiv:2601.08535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical problem of discrete distribution estimation using i.i.d. samples in a novel scenario where additional side information is available on the distribution. In large alphabet datasets such as text corpora, such side information arises naturally through word semantics/similarities that can be inferred by closeness of vector word embeddings, for instance. We consider two specific models for side information--a local model where the unknown distribution is in the neighborhood of a known distribution, and a partial ordering model where the alphabet is partitioned into known higher and lower probability sets. In both models, we theoretically characterize the improvement in a suitable squared-error risk because of the available side information. Simulations over natural language and synthetic data illustrate these gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08535v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QuantEval: A Benchmark for Financial Quantitative Tasks in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08689</link><description>arXiv:2601.08689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across many domains, yet their evaluation in financial quantitative tasks remains fragmented and mostly limited to knowledge-centric question answering. We introduce QuantEval, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs across three essential dimensions of quantitative finance: knowledge-based QA, quantitative mathematical reasoning, and quantitative strategy coding. Unlike prior financial benchmarks, QuantEval integrates a CTA-style backtesting framework that executes model-generated strategies and evaluates them using financial performance metrics, enabling a more realistic assessment of quantitative coding ability. We evaluate some state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs and observe substantial gaps to human experts, particularly in reasoning and strategy coding. Finally, we conduct large-scale supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning experiments on domain-aligned data, demonstrating consistent improvements. We hope QuantEval will facilitate research on LLMs' quantitative finance capabilities and accelerate their practical adoption in real-world trading workflows. We additionally release the full deterministic backtesting configuration (asset universe, cost model, and metric definitions) to ensure strict reproducibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08689v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Adversarial Poetry to Adversarial Tales: An Interpretability Research Agenda</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08837</link><description>arXiv:2601.08837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety mechanisms in LLMs remain vulnerable to attacks that reframe harmful requests through culturally coded structures. We introduce Adversarial Tales, a jailbreak technique that embeds harmful content within cyberpunk narratives and prompts models to perform functional analysis inspired by Vladimir Propp's morphology of folktales. By casting the task as structural decomposition, the attack induces models to reconstruct harmful procedures as legitimate narrative interpretation. Across 26 frontier models from nine providers, we observe an average attack success rate of 71.3%, with no model family proving reliably robust. Together with our prior work on Adversarial Poetry, these findings suggest that structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class rather than isolated techniques. The space of culturally coded frames that can mediate harmful intent is vast, likely inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone. Understanding why these attacks succeed is therefore essential: we outline a mechanistic interpretability research agenda to investigate how narrative cues reshape model representations and whether models can learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08837v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAM-pose2seg: Pose-Guided Human Instance Segmentation in Crowds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08982</link><description>arXiv:2601.08982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) provides an unprecedented foundation for human segmentation, but may struggle under occlusion, where keypoints may be partially or fully invisible. We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model. The code and pretrained models will be available at https://mirapurkrabek.github.io/BBox-Mask-Pose/.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08982v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Airy Beamforming for Radiative Near-Field MU-XL-MIMO: Overcoming Half-Space Blockage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link><description>arXiv:2601.09098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, often necessitating the deployment of auxiliary hardware such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to restore connectivity. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09098v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AviationLMM: A Large Multimodal Foundation Model for Civil Aviation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09105</link><description>arXiv:2601.09105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Civil aviation is a cornerstone of global transportation and commerce, and ensuring its safety, efficiency and customer satisfaction is paramount. Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09105v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision-Conditioned Variational Bayesian Last Layer Dynamics Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09178</link><description>arXiv:2601.09178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agile control of robotic systems often requires anticipating how the environment affects system behavior. For example, a driver must perceive the road ahead to anticipate available friction and plan actions accordingly. Achieving such proactive adaptation within autonomous frameworks remains a challenge, particularly under rapidly changing conditions. Traditional modeling approaches often struggle to capture abrupt variations in system behavior, while adaptive methods are inherently reactive and may adapt too late to ensure safety. We propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that leverages visual context to anticipate changes in the environment. The model first learns nominal vehicle dynamics and is then fine-tuned with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features, enabling context-aware dynamics prediction. The resulting model is integrated into an optimal controller for vehicle racing. We validate our method on a Lexus LC500 racing through water puddles. With vision-conditioning, the system completed all 12 attempted laps under varying conditions. In contrast, all baselines without visual context consistently lost control, demonstrating the importance of proactive dynamics adaptation in high-performance applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09178v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Generalized Leakage Interpretation of Alpha-Mutual Information</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09406</link><description>arXiv:2601.09406v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Large language models typically represent Chinese characters as discrete index-based tokens, largely ignoring their visual form. For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as 8 x 8 pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced hot-start effect: by 0.4% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12%, while index-based models lag at below 6%. Overall, our results demonstrate that minimal visual structure can provide a robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative perspective on character representation that complements traditional index-based approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09566v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Image2Garment: Simulation-ready Garment Generation from a Single Image</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09658</link><description>arXiv:2601.09658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image is challenging due to the absence of image-to-physics datasets and the ill-posed nature of this problem. Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09658v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing and Improving Punctuation Robustness in English-Marathi Machine Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09725</link><description>arXiv:2601.09725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Punctuation plays a critical role in resolving semantic and structural ambiguity in written language. Machine Translation (MT) systems are now widely applied across diverse domains and languages, including many low-resource settings. In this work, we focus on Marathi, a low- to middle-resource language. We introduce Vir\=am, the first diagnostic benchmark for assessing punctuation robustness in English-to-Marathi machine translation, consisting of 54 manually curated, punctuation-ambiguous instances. We evaluate two primary strategies for enhancing reliability: a pipeline-based restore-then-translate approach and direct fine-tuned on punctuation-varied data. Our results demonstrate that specialized fine-tuned models and pipeline systems significantly improve translation quality over standard baselines on the Vir\=am benchmark. Qualitative analysis reveals that the original model may result in wrong translations leading to wrong interpretations, while fine-tuned models significantly improve overall reliability. Furthermore, we find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) lag behind these task-specific approaches in preserving meaning for punctuation-ambiguous text, thus necessitating further research in this area.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors that are highly valuable for image restoration, yet their full pipelines remain too computationally heavy for deployment on edge devices. Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09823v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The PROPER Approach to Proactivity: Benchmarking and Advancing Knowledge Gap Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09926</link><description>arXiv:2601.09926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most language-based assistants follow a reactive ask-and-respond paradigm, requiring users to explicitly state their needs. As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09926v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] M^4olGen: Multi-Agent, Multi-Stage Molecular Generation under Precise Multi-Property Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10131</link><description>arXiv:2601.10131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10131v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Low-Complexity Architecture for Multi-access Coded Caching Systems with Arbitrary User-cache Access Topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10175</link><description>arXiv:2601.10175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the multi-access coded caching (MACC) problem under arbitrary user-cache access topologies, extending existing models that rely on highly structured and combinatorially designed connectivity. We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10175v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transmission Mask Analysis for Range-Doppler Sensing in Half-Duplex ISAC</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10259</link><description>arXiv:2601.10259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the periodic transmission masks for MASked Modulation (MASM) in half-duplex integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and derive their closed-form expected range-Doppler response $\mathbb{E}\{r(k,l,\nu)\}$. We show that range sidelobes ($k\neq l$) are Doppler-invariant, extending the range-sidelobe optimality to the 2-D setting. For the range mainlobe ($k=l$), periodic masking yields sparse Doppler sidelobes: Cyclic difference sets (CDSs) (in particular Singer CDSs) are minimax-optimal in a moderately dynamic regime, while in a highly dynamic regime the Doppler-sidelobe energy is a concave function of the mask autocorrelation, revealing an inevitable tradeoff with mainlobe fluctuation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10259v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPIKE: Sparse Koopman Regularization for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10282</link><description>arXiv:2601.10282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10282v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Efficient Long-Context Ranking Architecture With Calibrated LLM Distillation: Application to Person-Job Fit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10321</link><description>arXiv:2601.10321v2 Announce Type: replace

To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching. Experiments on relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10321v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OctoBench: Benchmarking Scaffold-Aware Instruction Following in Repository-Grounded Agentic Coding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10343</link><description>arXiv:2601.10343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern coding scaffolds turn LLMs into capable software agents, but their ability to follow scaffold-specified instructions remains under-examined, especially when constraints are heterogeneous and persist across interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce OctoBench, which benchmarks scaffold-aware instruction following in repository-grounded agentic coding. OctoBench includes 34 environments and 217 tasks instantiated under three scaffold types, and is paired with 7,098 objective checklist items. To disentangle solving the task from following the rules, we provide an automated observation-and-scoring toolkit that captures full trajectories and performs fine-grained checks. Experiments on eight representative models reveal a systematic gap between task-solving and scaffold-aware compliance, underscoring the need for training and evaluation that explicitly targets heterogeneous instruction following. We release the benchmark to support reproducible benchmarking and to accelerate the development of more scaffold-aware coding agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10343v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LatentRefusal: Latent-Signal Refusal for Unanswerable Text-to-SQL Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10398</link><description>arXiv:2601.10398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, unanswerable and underspecified user queries may generate not only incorrect text but also executable programs that yield misleading results or violate safety constraints, posing a major barrier to safe deployment. Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10398v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ChartComplete: A Taxonomy-based Inclusive Chart Dataset</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10462</link><description>arXiv:2601.10462v2 Announce Type: replace

The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10462v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MERGETUNE: Continued fine-tuning of vision-language models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10497</link><description>arXiv:2601.10497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, continued fine-tuning (CFT), which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven major gains in reasoning, perception, and generation across language and vision, yet whether these advances translate into comparable improvements in safety remains unclear, partly due to fragmented evaluations that focus on isolated modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of six frontier models--GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5--assessing each across language, vision-language, and image generation using a unified protocol that combines benchmark, adversarial, multilingual, and compliance evaluations. By aggregating results into safety leaderboards and model profiles, we reveal a highly uneven safety landscape: while GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced performance, other models exhibit clear trade-offs across benchmark safety, adversarial robustness, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Despite strong results under standard benchmarks, all models remain highly vulnerable under adversarial testing, with worst-case safety rates dropping below 6%. Text-to-image models show slightly stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain fragile when faced with adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these findings highlight that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation design--underscoring the need for standardized, holistic safety assessments to better reflect real-world risk and guide responsible deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10527v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PERM: Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10532</link><description>arXiv:2601.10532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in human-centric applications, yet they often fail to provide substantive emotional support. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM). PERM operationalizes empathy evaluation through a bidirectional decomposition: 1) Supporter perspective, assessing internal resonation and communicative expression; 2) Seeker perspective, evaluating emotional reception. Additionally, it incorporates a bystander perspective to monitor overall interaction quality. Extensive experiments on a widely-used emotional intelligence benchmark and an industrial daily conversation dataset demonstrate that PERM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\%. Furthermore, a blinded user study reveals a 70\% preference for our approach, highlighting its efficacy in generating more empathetic responses. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/ZhengWwwq/PERM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10532v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Detecting Toxic Flow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05827</link><description>arXiv:2312.05827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework to predict toxic trades that a broker receives from her clients. Toxic trades are predicted with a novel online learning Bayesian method which we call the projection-based unification of last-layer and subspace estimation (PULSE). PULSE is a fast and statistically-efficient Bayesian procedure for online training of neural networks. We employ a proprietary dataset of foreign exchange transactions to test our methodology. Neural networks trained with PULSE outperform standard machine learning and statistical methods when predicting if a trade will be toxic; the benchmark methods are logistic regression, random forests, and a recursively-updated maximum-likelihood estimator. We devise a strategy for the broker who uses toxicity predictions to internalise or to externalise each trade received from her clients. Our methodology can be implemented in real-time because it takes less than one millisecond to update parameters and make a prediction. Compared with the benchmarks, online learning of a neural network with PULSE attains the highest PnL and avoids the most losses by externalising toxic trades.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2312.05827v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spectral invariance and maximality properties of the frequency spectrum of quantum neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14515</link><description>arXiv:2402.14515v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the frequency spectrum of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) using Minkowski sums, which yields a compact algebraic description and permits explicit computation. Using this description, we prove several maximality results for broad classes of QNN architectures. Under some mild technical conditions we establish a bijection between classes of models with the same area $A:=R\cdot L$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A=RL$ and not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we collect and extend existing results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with an arbitrary number of layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. In the case of arbitrary dimensional generators, where our two introduced notions of maximality differ, we extend existing Golomb ruler based results and introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem, which we call the relaxed turnpike problem. We clarify comprehensively how the generators of a QNN must be chosen in order to obtain a maximal frequency spectrum for a given area $A$, thereby contributing to a deeper theoretical understanding. However, our numerical experiments show that trainability depends not only on $A = RL$, but also on the choice of $(R,L)$, so that knowledge of the maximum frequency spectrum alone is not sufficient to ensure good trainability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2402.14515v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HERMES: Holographic Equivariant neuRal network model for Mutational Effect and Stability prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06703</link><description>arXiv:2407.06703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the stability and fitness effects of amino acid mutations in proteins is a cornerstone of biological discovery and engineering. Various experimental techniques have been developed to measure mutational effects, providing us with extensive datasets across a diverse range of proteins. By training on these data, traditional computational modeling and more recent machine learning approaches have advanced significantly in predicting mutational effects. Here, we introduce HERMES, a 3D rotationally equivariant structure-based neural network model for mutational effect and stability prediction. Pre-trained to predict amino acid propensity from its surrounding 3D structure, HERMES can be fine-tuned for mutational effects using our open-source code. We present a suite of HERMES models, pre-trained with different strategies, and fine-tuned to predict the stability effect of mutations. Benchmarking against other models shows that HERMES often outperforms or matches their performance in predicting mutational effect on stability, binding, and fitness. HERMES offers versatile tools for evaluating mutational effects and can be fine-tuned for specific predictive objectives.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.06703v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Feature Mapping GAP: Integrating Real HDRTV Priors for Superior SDRTV-to-HDRTV Conversion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10775</link><description>arXiv:2411.10775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of HDR-WCG display devices has highlighted the need to convert SDRTV to HDRTV, as most video sources are still in SDR. Existing methods primarily focus on designing neural networks to learn a single-style mapping from SDRTV to HDRTV. However, the limited information in SDRTV and the diversity of styles in real-world conversions render this process an ill-posed problem, thereby constraining the performance and generalization of these methods. Inspired by generative approaches, we propose a novel method for SDRTV to HDRTV conversion guided by real HDRTV priors. Despite the limited information in SDRTV, introducing real HDRTV as reference priors significantly constrains the solution space of the originally high-dimensional ill-posed problem. This shift transforms the task from solving an unreferenced prediction problem to making a referenced selection, thereby markedly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the conversion process. Specifically, our approach comprises two stages: the first stage employs a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network to capture HDRTV priors, while the second stage matches these priors to the input SDRTV content to recover realistic HDRTV outputs. We evaluate our method on public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness with significant improvements in both objective and subjective metrics across real and synthetic datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.10775v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Online Rack Placement in Large-Scale Data Centers: Online Sampling Optimization and Deployment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12725</link><description>arXiv:2501.12725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper optimizes the configuration of large-scale data centers toward cost-effective, reliable and sustainable cloud supply chains. The problem involves placing incoming racks of servers within a data center to maximize demand coverage given space, power and cooling restrictions. We formulate an online integer optimization model to support rack placement decisions. We propose a tractable online sampling optimization (OSO) approach to multi-stage stochastic optimization, which approximates unknown parameters with a sample path and re-optimizes decisions dynamically. We prove that OSO achieves a strong competitive ratio in canonical online resource allocation problems and sublinear regret in the online batched bin packing problem. Theoretical and computational results show it can outperform mean-based certainty-equivalent resolving heuristics. Our algorithm has been packaged into a software solution deployed across Microsoft's data centers, contributing an interactive decision-making process at the human-machine interface. Using deployment data, econometric tests suggest that adoption of the solution has a negative and statistically significant impact on power stranding, estimated at 1-3 percentage point. At the scale of cloud computing, these improvements in data center performance result in significant cost savings and environmental benefits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.12725v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Epidemic Forecasting with a Hybrid Deep Learning Method Using CNN-LSTM With WOA-GWO Parameter Optimization: Global COVID-19 Case Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12813</link><description>arXiv:2503.12813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective epidemic modeling is essential for managing public health crises, requiring robust methods to predict disease spread and optimize resource allocation. This study introduces a novel deep learning framework that advances time series forecasting for infectious diseases, with its application to COVID 19 data as a critical case study. Our hybrid approach integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to capture spatial and temporal dynamics of disease transmission across diverse regions. The CNN extracts spatial features from raw epidemiological data, while the LSTM models temporal patterns, yielding precise and adaptable predictions. To maximize performance, we employ a hybrid optimization strategy combining the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) to fine tune hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs enhancing model efficiency and accuracy. Applied to COVID 19 case data from 24 countries across six continents, our method outperforms established benchmarks, including ARIMA and standalone LSTM models, with statistically significant gains in predictive accuracy (e.g., reduced RMSE). This framework demonstrates its potential as a versatile method for forecasting epidemic trends, offering insights for resource planning and decision making in both historical contexts, like the COVID 19 pandemic, and future outbreaks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.12813v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universal Architectures for the Learning of Polyhedral Norms and Convex Regularizers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19190</link><description>arXiv:2503.19190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning convex regularizers to guide the reconstruction of images from limited data. By imposing that the reconstruction be amplitude-equivariant, we narrow down the class of admissible functionals to those that can be expressed as a power of a seminorm. We then show that such functionals can be approximated to arbitrary precision with the help of polyhedral norms. In particular, we identify two dual parameterizations of such systems: (i) a synthesis form with an $\ell_1$-penalty that involves some learnable dictionary; and (ii) an analysis form with an $\ell_\infty$-penalty that involves a trainable regularization operator. After having provided geometric insights and proved that the two forms are universal, we propose an implementation that relies on a specific architecture (tight frame with a weighted $\ell_1$ penalty) that is easy to train. We illustrate its use for denoising and the reconstruction of biomedical images. We find that the proposed framework outperforms the sparsity-based methods of compressed sensing, while it offers essentially the same convergence and robustness guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.19190v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02367</link><description>arXiv:2504.02367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.02367v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conditional Distribution Compression via the Kernel Conditional Mean Embedding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10139</link><description>arXiv:2504.10139v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods, like Kernel Herding (KH), were originally developed for unlabelled data. However, no existing approach directly compresses the conditional distribution of \textit{labelled} data. To address this gap, we first introduce the Average Maximum Conditional Mean Discrepancy (AMCMD), a metric for comparing conditional distributions, and derive a closed form estimator. Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution compression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can be reduced from cubic to linear. Leveraging this, we extend KH to propose Average Conditional Kernel Herding (ACKH), a linear-time greedy algorithm for constructing compressed sets that target the AMCMD. To better understand the advantages of directly compressing the conditional distribution rather than doing so via the joint distribution, we introduce Joint Kernel Herding (JKH), an adaptation of KH designed to compress the joint distribution of labelled data. While herding methods provide a simple and interpretable selection process, they rely on a greedy heuristic. To explore alternative optimisation strategies, we also propose Joint Kernel Inducing Points (JKIP) and Average Conditional Kernel Inducing Points (ACKIP), which jointly optimise the compressed set while maintaining linear complexity. Experiments show that directly preserving conditional distributions with ACKIP outperforms both joint distribution compression and the greedy selection used in ACKH. Moreover, we see that JKIP consistently outperforms JKH.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.10139v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FEAT: Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11516</link><description>arXiv:2504.11516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross

Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.08683v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Global Minimizers of $\ell^p$-Regularized Objectives Yield the Sparsest ReLU Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21791</link><description>arXiv:2505.21791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks can interpolate a given dataset in many different ways, prompting the fundamental question: which among these solutions should we prefer, and what explicit regularization strategies will provably yield these solutions? This paper addresses the challenge of finding the sparsest interpolating ReLU network--i.e., the network with the fewest nonzero parameters or neurons--a goal with wide-ranging implications for efficiency, generalization, interpretability, theory, and model compression. Unlike post hoc pruning approaches, we propose a continuous, almost-everywhere differentiable training objective whose global minima are guaranteed to correspond to the sparsest single-hidden-layer ReLU networks that fit the data. This result marks a conceptual advance: it recasts the combinatorial problem of sparse interpolation as a smooth optimization task, potentially enabling the use of gradient-based training methods. Our objective is based on minimizing $\ell^p$ quasinorms of the weights for $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$, a classical sparsity-promoting strategy in finite-dimensional settings. However, applying these ideas to neural networks presents new challenges: the function class is infinite-dimensional, and the weights are learned using a highly nonconvex objective. We prove that, under our formulation, global minimizers correspond exactly to sparsest solutions. Our work lays a foundation for understanding when and how continuous sparsity-inducing objectives can be leveraged to recover sparse networks through training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.21791v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quasi-Monte Carlo with one categorical variable</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16582</link><description>arXiv:2506.16582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) estimation of a multivariate integral where one of the variables takes only a finite number of values. This problem arises when the variable of integration is drawn from a mixture distribution as is common in importance sampling and also arises in some recent work on transport maps. We find that when integration error decreases at an RQMC rate that it is then important to oversample the smallest mixture components instead of using a proportional allocation. This can even improve the rate of convergence. The optimal allocations depend on the possibly unknown convergence rate. Designing the sample with an incorrect assumption on the rate still attains that convergence rate, with an inferior implied constant. The penalty for using a pessimistic rate is typically higher than for using an optimistic one. We also find that for the most accurate RQMC sampling methods, it is advantageous to arrange that our $n=2^m$ randomized Sobol' points split into subsample sizes that are also powers of $2$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.16582v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fetal Sleep: A Cross-Species Review of Physiology, Measurement, and Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21828</link><description>arXiv:2506.21828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Study Objectives: Fetal sleep is a vital yet underexplored aspect of prenatal neurodevelopment. Its cyclic organization reflects the maturation of central neural circuits, and disturbances in these patterns may offer some of the earliest detectable signs of neurological compromise. This is the first review to integrate more than seven decades of research into a unified, cross-species synthesis of fetal sleep. We examine: (i) Physiology and Ontogeny-comparing human fetuses with animal models; and (ii) Methodological Evolution-transitioning from invasive neurophysiology to non-invasive monitoring and deep learning frameworks.
  Methods: A structured narrative synthesis was guided by a systematic literature search across four databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar). From 2,925 identified records, 171 studies involving fetal sleep-related physiology, sleep-state classification, or signal-based monitoring were included in this review.
  Results: Across the 171 studies, fetal sleep states become clearly observable as the brain matures. In fetal sheep and baboons, organized cycling between active and quiet sleep emerges at approximately 80%-90% gestation. In humans, this differentiation occurs later, around 95% gestation, with full maturation reached near term. Despite extensive animal research, no unified, clinically validated framework exists for defining fetal sleep states, limiting translation into routine obstetric practice.
  Conclusions: By integrating evidence across species, methodologies, and clinical contexts, this review provides the scientific foundation for developing objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies-tools that may ultimately support earlier detection of neurological compromise and guide timely prenatal intervention.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.21828v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 3D latent diffusion models for parameterizing and history matching multiscenario facies systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16621</link><description>arXiv:2508.16621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geological parameterization procedures entail the mapping of a high-dimensional geomodel to a low-dimensional latent variable. These parameterizations can be very useful for history matching because the number of variables to be calibrated is greatly reduced, and the mapping can be constructed such that geological realism is automatically preserved. In this work, a parameterization method based on generative latent diffusion models (LDMs) is developed for 3D channel-levee-mud systems. Geomodels with variable scenario parameters, specifically mud fraction, channel orientation, and channel width, are considered. A perceptual loss term is included during training to improve geological realism. For any set of scenario parameters, an (essentially) infinite number of realizations can be generated, so our LDM parameterizes over a very wide model space. New realizations constructed using the LDM procedure are shown to closely resemble reference geomodels, both visually and in terms of one- and two-point spatial statistics. Flow response distributions, for a specified set of injection and production wells, are also shown to be in close agreement between the two sets of models. The parameterization method is applied for ensemble-based history matching, with model updates performed in the LDM latent space, for cases involving geological scenario uncertainty. For three synthetic true models corresponding to different geological scenarios, we observe clear uncertainty reduction in both production forecasts and geological scenario parameters. The overall method is additionally shown to provide posterior geomodels consistent with the synthetic true model in each case.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.16621v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Inference under Threshold Manipulation: Bayesian Mixture Modeling and Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19814</link><description>arXiv:2509.19814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many marketing applications, including credit card incentive programs, offer rewards to customers who exceed specific spending thresholds to encourage increased consumption. Quantifying the causal effect of these thresholds on customers is crucial for effective marketing strategy design. Although regression discontinuity design is a standard method for such causal inference tasks, its assumptions can be violated when customers, aware of the thresholds, strategically manipulate their spending to qualify for the rewards. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for estimating the causal effect under threshold manipulation. The main idea is to model the observed spending distribution as a mixture of two distributions: one representing customers strategically affected by the threshold, and the other representing those unaffected. To fit the mixture model, we adopt a two-step Bayesian approach consisting of modeling non-bunching customers and fitting a mixture model to a sample around the threshold. We show posterior contraction of the resulting posterior distribution of the causal effect under large samples. Furthermore, we extend this framework to a hierarchical Bayesian setting to estimate heterogeneous causal effects across customer subgroups, allowing for stable inference even with small subgroup sample sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through simulation studies and illustrate their practical implications using a real-world marketing dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19814v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transfer Learning for Benign Overfitting in High-Dimensional Linear Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15337</link><description>arXiv:2510.15337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is a key component of modern machine learning, enhancing the performance of target tasks by leveraging diverse data sources. Simultaneously, overparameterized models such as the minimum-$\ell_2$-norm interpolator (MNI) in high-dimensional linear regression have garnered significant attention for their remarkable generalization capabilities, a property known as benign overfitting. Despite their individual importance, the intersection of transfer learning and MNI remains largely unexplored. Our research bridges this gap by proposing a novel two-step Transfer MNI approach and analyzing its trade-offs. We characterize its non-asymptotic excess risk and identify conditions under which it outperforms the target-only MNI. Our analysis reveals free-lunch covariate shift regimes, where leveraging heterogeneous data yields the benefit of knowledge transfer at limited cost. To operationalize our findings, we develop a data-driven procedure to detect informative sources and introduce an ensemble method incorporating multiple informative Transfer MNIs. Finite-sample experiments demonstrate the robustness of our methods to model and data heterogeneity, confirming their advantage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.15337v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum, Diplomacy, and Geopolitics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06052</link><description>arXiv:2512.06052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies, spanning communication, sensing, computing, and cryptography, are rapidly emerging as critical paths of geopolitical competition and strategic defence innovation. Unlike traditional technological advances, quantum introduces novel capabilities that fundamentally disrupt established norms of security, intelligence, and diplomatic engagement. This strategic analysis explores the evolving quantum landscape through the dual lenses of diplomacy and geopolitics, with specific implications for defence leaders, policymakers, and industry stakeholders. The benefits and challenges of quantum technologies are examined from a diplomatic and geopolitical perspective to help leaders make informed strategic decisions. Leading powers now recognise quantum as a domain where technological leadership directly translates to geopolitical influence, compelling an intense race for dominance alongside new forms of multilateral diplomacy aimed at managing both risks and opportunities. Quantum technologies do not all have the same operational maturity, but technological progress is accelerating. Post-quantum cryptography demands immediate action, every encrypted communication created today may be harvested and decrypted within the decade by adversaries equipped with quantum capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06052v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Monitoring Deployed AI Systems in Health Care</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09048</link><description>arXiv:2512.09048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-deployment monitoring of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in health care is essential to ensure their safety, quality, and sustained benefit-and to support governance decisions about which systems to update, modify, or decommission. Motivated by these needs, we developed a framework for monitoring deployed AI systems grounded in the mandate to take specific actions when they fail to behave as intended. This framework, which is now actively used at Stanford Health Care, is organized around three complementary principles: system integrity, performance, and impact. System integrity monitoring focuses on maximizing system uptime, detecting runtime errors, and identifying when changes to the surrounding IT ecosystem have unintended effects. Performance monitoring focuses on maintaining accurate system behavior in the face of changing health care practices (and thus input data) over time. Impact monitoring assesses whether a deployed system continues to have value in the form of benefit to clinicians and patients. Drawing on examples of deployed AI systems at our academic medical center, we provide practical guidance for creating monitoring plans based on these principles that specify which metrics to measure, when those metrics should be reviewed, who is responsible for acting when metrics change, and what concrete follow-up actions should be taken-for both traditional and generative AI. We also discuss challenges to implementing this framework, including the effort and cost of monitoring for health systems with limited resources and the difficulty of incorporating data-driven monitoring practices into complex organizations where conflicting priorities and definitions of success often coexist. This framework offers a practical template and starting point for health systems seeking to ensure that AI deployments remain safe and effective over time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.09048v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal learning of quantum channels in diamond distance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10214</link><description>arXiv:2512.10214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography, the task of estimating an unknown quantum channel, is a central problem in quantum information theory. A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard metric for distinguishing quantum processes. While the analogous problem of quantum state tomography has been settled over the past decades in both the pure- and mixed-state settings, for general quantum channels it remained largely open beyond the unitary case. Here we design an algorithm showing that any channel with input and output dimensions $d_{\mathrm{in}},d_{\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$ can be learned to constant accuracy in diamond distance using $\Theta(d_{\mathrm{in}}d_{\mathrm{out}}k)$ channel uses, and we prove that this scaling is optimal via a matching lower bound. More generally, achieving accuracy $\varepsilon$ is possible with $O(d_{\mathrm{in}}d_{\mathrm{out}}k/\varepsilon^{2})$ channel uses. Since quantum channels subsume states, unitaries, and isometries as special cases, our protocol provides a unified framework for the corresponding tomography tasks; in particular, it yields the first optimal protocols for isometries and for binary measurement tomography, and it recovers optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach reduces channel tomography to pure-state tomography: we use the channel to prepare copies of its Choi state, purify them in parallel, and run sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the resulting purifications; we then show that the induced diamond-distance error scales essentially linearly with the trace-distance error in estimating the (purified) Choi state. We also resolve an open question by showing that adaptivity does not improve the dimension-optimal query complexity of quantum channel tomography.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10214v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simultaneous and Proportional Finger Motion Decoding Using Spatial Features from High-Density Surface Electromyography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13870</link><description>arXiv:2512.13870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\Sigma$), field-strength variation rate ($\Phi$), and spatial complexity ($\Omega$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13870v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A New Decomposition Paradigm for Graph-structured Nonlinear Programs via Message Passing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24676</link><description>arXiv:2512.24676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite-sum nonlinear programs with localized variable coupling encoded by a (hyper)graph. We introduce a graph-compliant decomposition framework that brings message passing into continuous optimization in a rigorous, implementable, and provable way. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters (hypertree factor graphs). At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving local subproblems whose objective splits into an {\it intra}-cluster term summarized by cost-to-go messages from one min-sum sweep on the cluster tree, and an {\it inter}-cluster coupling term handled Jacobi-style using the latest out-of-cluster variables. To reduce computation/communication, the method supports graph-compliant surrogates that replace exact messages/local solves with compact low-dimensional parametrizations; in hypergraphs, the same principle enables surrogate hyperedge splitting, to tame heavy hyperedge overlaps while retaining finite-time intra-cluster message updates and efficient computation/communication. We establish convergence for (strongly) convex and nonconvex objectives, with topology- and partition-explicit rates that quantify curvature/coupling effects and guide clustering and scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24676v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link><description>arXiv:2601.07742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal Sampling Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09848</link><description>arXiv:2601.09848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving a finite number of particles using a particular score estimator rather than Brownian motion. To accelerate the particles, we consider a second-order score-based ODE, similar to Nesterov acceleration. In contrast to traditional kernel density score estimation, we use the recently proposed regularized Wasserstein proximal method, yielding the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP). We provide a detailed analysis of continuous- and discrete-time non-asymptotic and asymptotic mixing rates for Gaussian initial and target distributions, using techniques from Euclidean acceleration and accelerated information gradients. Compared with the kinetic Langevin sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher contraction rate in the asymptotic time regime. Numerical experiments are conducted across various low-dimensional experiments, including multi-modal Gaussian mixtures and ill-conditioned Rosenbrock distributions. ARWP exhibits structured and convergent particles, accelerated discrete-time mixing, and faster tail exploration than the non-accelerated regularized Wasserstein proximal method and kinetic Langevin methods. Additionally, ARWP particles exhibit better generalization properties for some non-log-concave Bayesian neural network tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09848v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The incompatibility of the Condorcet winner and loser criteria with positive involvement and resolvability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10506</link><description>arXiv:2601.10506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is no preferential voting method satisfying the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, positive involvement (if a candidate $x$ wins in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely first cannot cause $x$ to lose), and $n$-voter resolvability (if $x$ initially ties for winning, then $x$ can be made the unique winner by adding up to $n$ voters). In a previous note, we proved an analogous result assuming an additional axiom of ordinal margin invariance, which we now show is unnecessary for an impossibility theorem, at least if the desired voting method is defined for five-candidate elections.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10506v2</guid></item></channel></rss>
