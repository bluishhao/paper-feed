Abstract: The use of synthetic data in health applications raises privacy concerns, yet the lack of open frameworks for privacy evaluations has slowed its adoption. A major challenge is the absence of accessible benchmark datasets for evaluating privacy risks, due to difficulties in acquiring sensitive data. To address this, we introduce SynQP, an open framework for benchmarking privacy in synthetic data generation (SDG) using simulated sensitive data, ensuring that original data remains confidential. We also highlight the need for privacy metrics that fairly account for the probabilistic nature of machine learning models. As a demonstration, we use SynQP to benchmark CTGAN and propose a new identity disclosure risk metric that offers a more accurate estimation of privacy risks compared to existing approaches. Our work provides a critical tool for improving the transparency and reliability of privacy evaluations, enabling safer use of synthetic data in health-related applications. % In our quality evaluations, non-private models achieved near-perfect machine-learning efficacy \(\ge0.97\). Our privacy assessments (Table II) reveal that DP consistently lowers both identity disclosure risk (SD-IDR) and membership-inference attack risk (SD-MIA), with all DP-augmented models staying below the 0.09 regulatory threshold.

Abstract: Existing 3D human motion generation and understanding methods often exhibit limited interpretability, restricting effective mutual enhancement between these inherently related tasks. While current unified frameworks based on large language models (LLMs) leverage linguistic priors, they frequently encounter challenges in semantic alignment and task coherence. Moreover, the next-token prediction paradigm in LLMs is ill-suited for motion sequences, causing cumulative prediction errors. To address these limitations, we propose UniMo, a novel framework that integrates motion-language information and interpretable chain of thought (CoT) reasoning into the LLM via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We further introduce reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a post-training strategy that optimizes over groups of tokens to enforce structural correctness and semantic alignment, mitigating cumulative errors in motion token prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMo significantly outperforms existing unified and task-specific models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both motion generation and understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SolarGPT-QA: A Domain-Adaptive Large Language Model for Educational Question Answering in Space Weather and Heliophysics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12131</link><description>arXiv:2601.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar activity, including solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and geomagnetic storms, can significantly impact satellites, aviation, power grids, data centers, and space missions. Extreme solar events can cause substantial economic damage if not predicted in advance, highlighting the importance of accurate forecasting and effective education in space science. Although large language models (LLMs) perform well on general tasks, they often lack domain-specific knowledge and pedagogical capability to clearly explain complex space science concepts.
  We introduce SolarGPT-QA, a question answering system based on a domain-adapted large language model built on the LLaMA-3 base model. The model is trained using scientific literature and large-scale question-answer data generated with GPT-4 and refined using Grok-3 in a student-friendly storytelling style. Human pairwise evaluations show that SolarGPT-QA outperforms general-purpose models in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance compared to instruction-tuned models for educational explanations in space weather and heliophysics. A small pilot student comprehension study further suggests improved clarity and accessibility of the generated explanations. Ablation experiments indicate that combining domain-adaptive pretraining with pedagogical fine-tuning is important for balancing scientific accuracy and educational effectiveness. This work represents an initial step toward a broader SolarGPT framework for space science education and forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bengali Text Classification: An Evaluation of Large Language Model Approaches</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12132</link><description>arXiv:2601.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bengali text classification is a Significant task in natural language processing (NLP), where text is categorized into predefined labels. Unlike English, Bengali faces challenges due to the lack of extensive annotated datasets and pre-trained language models. This study explores the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in classifying Bengali newspaper articles. The dataset used, obtained from Kaggle, consists of articles from Prothom Alo, a major Bangladeshi newspaper. Three instruction-tuned LLMs LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, LLaMA 3.2 3B Instruct, and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct were evaluated for this task under the same classification framework. Among the evaluated models, Qwen 2.5 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 72%, showing particular strength in the "Sports" category. In comparison, LLaMA 3.1 and LLaMA 3.2 attained accuracies of 53% and 56%, respectively. The findings highlight the effectiveness of LLMs in Bengali text classification, despite the scarcity of resources for Bengali NLP. Future research will focus on exploring additional models, addressing class imbalance issues, and refining fine-tuning approaches to improve classification performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human-Human-AI Triadic Programming: Uncovering the Role of AI Agent and the Value of Human Partner in Collaborative Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12134</link><description>arXiv:2601.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI assistance becomes embedded in programming practice, researchers have increasingly examined how these systems help learners generate code and work more efficiently. However, these studies often position AI as a replacement for human collaboration and overlook the social and learning-oriented aspects that emerge in collaborative programming. Our work introduces human-human-AI (HHAI) triadic programming, where an AI agent serves as an additional collaborator rather than a substitute for a human partner. Through a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we show that triadic collaboration enhances collaborative learning and social presence compared to the dyadic human-AI (HAI) baseline. In the triadic HHAI conditions, participants relied significantly less on AI-generated code in their work. This effect was strongest in the HHAI-shared condition, where participants had an increased sense of responsibility to understand AI suggestions before applying them. These findings demonstrate how triadic settings activate socially shared regulation of learning by making AI use visible and accountable to a human peer, suggesting that AI systems that augment rather than automate peer collaboration can better preserve the learning processes that collaborative programming relies on.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoSMeTIC: Zero-Knowledge Computational Sparse Merkle Trees with Inclusion-Exclusion Proofs for Clinical Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12136</link><description>arXiv:2601.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of clinical data is a cornerstone of biomedical research with applications in areas such as genomic testing and response characterization of therapeutic drugs. Maintaining strict privacy controls is essential because such data typically contains personally identifiable health information of patients. At the same time, regulatory compliance often requires study managers to demonstrate the integrity and authenticity of participant data used in analyses. Balancing these competing requirements, privacy preservation and verifiable accountability, remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present CoSMeTIC, a zero-knowledge computational framework that proposes computational Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs) as a means to generate verifiable inclusion and exclusion proofs for individual participants' data in clinical studies. We formally analyze the zero-knowledge properties of CoSMeTIC and evaluate its computational efficiency through extensive experiments. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and likelihood-ratio hypothesis tests, along with logistic-regression-based genomic analyses on real-world Huntington's disease datasets, we demonstrate that CoSMeTIC achieves strong privacy guarantees while maintaining statistical fidelity. Our results suggest that CoSMeTIC provides a scalable and practical alternative for achieving regulatory compliance with rigorous privacy protection in large-scale clinical research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12136v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EMoE: Eigenbasis-Guided Routing for Mixture-of-Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12137</link><description>arXiv:2601.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relentless scaling of deep learning models has led to unsustainable computational demands, positioning Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures as a promising path towards greater efficiency. However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space. This principled, geometric partitioning of data intrinsically promotes both balanced expert utilization and the development of diverse, specialized experts, all without the need for a conflicting auxiliary loss function. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Belis0811/EMoE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12137v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DriveSafe: A Hierarchical Risk Taxonomy for Safety-Critical LLM-Based Driving Assistants</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12138</link><description>arXiv:2601.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into vehicle-based digital assistants, where unsafe, ambiguous, or legally incorrect responses can lead to serious safety, ethical, and regulatory consequences. Despite growing interest in LLM safety, existing taxonomies and evaluation frameworks remain largely general-purpose and fail to capture the domain-specific risks inherent to real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DriveSafe, a hierarchical, four-level risk taxonomy designed to systematically characterize safety-critical failure modes of LLM-based driving assistants. The taxonomy comprises 129 fine-grained atomic risk categories spanning technical, legal, societal, and ethical dimensions, grounded in real-world driving regulations and safety principles and reviewed by domain experts. To validate the safety relevance and realism of the constructed prompts, we evaluate their refusal behavior across six widely deployed LLMs. Our analysis shows that the evaluated models often fail to appropriately refuse unsafe or non-compliant driving-related queries, underscoring the limitations of general-purpose safety alignment in driving contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12138v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TIDE: A Trace-Informed Depth-First Exploration for Planning with Temporally Extended Goals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12141</link><description>arXiv:2601.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task planning with temporally extended goals (TEGs) is a critical challenge in AI and robotics, enabling agents to achieve complex sequences of objectives over time rather than addressing isolated, immediate tasks. Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12141v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Process-Based Reactive Controller for Autonomous Racing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12143</link><description>arXiv:2601.12143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention-based neural architectures have become central to state-of-the-art methods in real-time nonlinear control. As these data-driven models continue to be integrated into increasingly safety-critical domains, ensuring statistically grounded and provably safe decision-making becomes essential. This paper introduces a novel reactive control framework for gap-based navigation using the Attentive Neural Process (AttNP) and a physics-informed extension, the PI-AttNP. Both models are evaluated in a simulated F1TENTH-style Ackermann steering racecar environment, chosen as a fast-paced proxy for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios. The PI-AttNP augments the AttNP architecture with approximate model-based priors to inject physical inductive bias, enabling faster convergence and improved prediction accuracy suited for real-time control. To further ensure safety, we derive and implement a control barrier function (CBF)-based filtering mechanism that analytically enforces collision avoidance constraints. This CBF formulation is fully compatible with the learned AttNP controller and generalizes across a wide range of racing scenarios, providing a lightweight and certifiable safety layer. Our results demonstrate competitive closed-loop performance while ensuring real-time constraint satisfaction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12143v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Threshold Differential Attention for Sink-Free, Ultra-Sparse, and Non-Dispersive Language Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12145</link><description>arXiv:2601.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Softmax attention struggles with long contexts due to structural limitations: the strict sum-to-one constraint forces attention sinks on irrelevant tokens, and probability mass disperses as sequence lengths increase. We tackle these problems with Threshold Differential Attention (TDA), a sink-free attention mechanism that achieves ultra-sparsity and improved robustness at longer sequence lengths without the computational overhead of projection methods or the performance degradation caused by noise accumulation of standard rectified attention. TDA applies row-wise extreme-value thresholding with a length-dependent gate, retaining only exceedances. Inspired by the differential transformer, TDA also subtracts an inhibitory view to enhance expressivity. Theoretically, we prove that TDA controls the expected number of spurious survivors per row to $O(1)$ and that consensus spurious matches across independent views vanish as context grows. Empirically, TDA produces $&gt;99\%$ exact zeros and eliminates attention sinks while maintaining competitive performance on standard and long-context benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12145v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From LLMs to Agents in Programming: The Impact of Providing an LLM with a Compiler</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12146</link><description>arXiv:2601.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated a remarkable capability in natural language and program generation and software development. However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a \texttt{gcc} compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75\%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87\% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Segment and Matte Anything in a Unified Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12147</link><description>arXiv:2601.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) has recently pushed the boundaries of segmentation by demonstrating zero-shot generalization and flexible prompting after training on over one billion masks. Despite this, its mask prediction accuracy often falls short of the precision required in real-world applications. While several refinement modules have been proposed to boost SAM's segmentation quality, achieving highly accurate object delineation within a single, unified framework remains an open challenge. Furthermore, interactive image matting, which aims to generate fine-grained alpha mattes guided by diverse user hints, has not yet been explored in the context of SAM. Insights from recent studies highlight strong correlations between segmentation and matting, suggesting the feasibility of a unified model capable of both tasks. In this paper, we introduce Segment And Matte Anything (SAMA), a lightweight extension of SAM that delivers high-quality interactive image segmentation and matting with minimal extra parameters. Our Multi-View Localization Encoder (MVLE) captures detailed features from local views, while the Localization Adapter (Local-Adapter) refines mask outputs by recovering subtle boundary details. We also incorporate two prediction heads for each task into the architecture to generate segmentation and matting masks, simultaneously. Trained on a diverse dataset aggregated from publicly available sources, SAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple segmentation and matting benchmarks, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness in a wide range of downstream tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12147v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Many Hands Make Light Work: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Detecting Malicious PyPI Packages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12148</link><description>arXiv:2601.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malicious code in open-source repositories such as PyPI poses a growing threat to software supply chains. Traditional rule-based tools often overlook the semantic patterns in source code that are crucial for identifying adversarial components. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for software analysis, yet their use in interpretable and modular security pipelines remains limited. This paper presents LAMPS, a multi-agent system that employs collaborative LLMs to detect malicious PyPI packages. The system consists of four role-specific agents for package retrieval, file extraction, classification, and verdict aggregation, coordinated through the CrewAI framework. A prototype combines a fine-tuned CodeBERT model for classification with LLaMA-3 agents for contextual reasoning. LAMPS has been evaluated on two complementary datasets: D1, a balanced collection of 6,000 setup.py files, and D2, a realistic multi-file dataset with 1,296 files and natural class imbalance. On D1, LAMPS achieves 97.7% accuracy, surpassing MPHunter--one of the state-of-the-art approaches. On D2, it reaches 99.5% accuracy and 99.5% balanced accuracy, outperforming RAG-based approaches and fine-tuned single-agent baselines. McNemar's test confirmed these improvements as highly significant. The results demonstrate the feasibility of distributed LLM reasoning for malicious code detection and highlight the benefits of modular multi-agent designs in software supply chain security.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12148v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Principal Component Analysis-Based Terahertz Self-Supervised Denoising and Deblurring Deep Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12149</link><description>arXiv:2601.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) systems inherently introduce frequency-dependent degradation effects, resulting in low-frequency blurring and high-frequency noise in amplitude images. Conventional image processing techniques cannot simultaneously address both issues, and manual intervention is often required due to the unknown boundary between denoising and deblurring. To tackle this challenge, we propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-based THz self-supervised denoising and deblurring network (THz-SSDD). The network employs a Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted self-supervised learning strategy to capture the intrinsic features of noise by exploiting invariance under repeated corruption. PCA decomposition and reconstruction are then applied to restore images across both low and high frequencies. The performance of the THz-SSDD network was evaluated on four types of samples. Training requires only a small set of unlabeled noisy images, and testing across samples with different material properties and measurement modes demonstrates effective denoising and deblurring. Quantitative analysis further validates the network feasibility, showing improvements in image quality while preserving the physical characteristics of the original signals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12149v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhanced Diagnostic Performance via Large-Resolution Inference Optimization for Pathology Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12150</link><description>arXiv:2601.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their prominent performance on tasks such as ROI classification and segmentation, many pathology foundation models remain constrained by a specific input size e.g. 224 x 224, creating substantial inefficiencies when applied to whole-slide images (WSIs), which span thousands of resolutions. A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget. The experimental results show that our method can achieves up to an 7.67% improvement in the ROI classification and compatible results in segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Owns Creativity and Who Does the Work?

Abstract: LLM-based agents offer new potential to accelerate science and reshape research work. However, the quality of researcher contributions can vary significantly depending on human ability to steer agent behaviors. How can we best use these tools to augment scientific creativity without undermining aspects of contribution and ownership that drive research? To investigate this, we developed an agentic research ideation system integrating three roles -- Ideator, Writer, and Evaluator -- across three control levels -- Low, Medium, and Intensive. Our mixed-methods study with 54 researchers suggests three key findings in how LLM-based agents reshape scientific creativity: 1) perceived creativity support does not simply increase linearly with greater control; 2) human effort shifts from ideating to verifying ideas; and 3) ownership becomes a negotiated outcome between human and AI. Our findings suggest that LLM agent design should emphasize researcher empowerment, fostering a sense of ownership over strong ideas rather than reducing researchers to operating an automated AI-driven process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12152v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analyzing Cancer Patients' Experiences with Embedding-based Topic Modeling and LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12154</link><description>arXiv:2601.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of neural topic modeling and LLMs to uncover meaningful themes from patient storytelling data, to offer insights that could contribute to more patient-oriented healthcare practices. We analyze a collection of transcribed interviews with cancer patients (132,722 words in 13 interviews). We first evaluate BERTopic and Top2Vec for individual interview summarization by using similar preprocessing, chunking, and clustering configurations to ensure a fair comparison on Keyword Extraction. LLMs (GPT4) are then used for the next step topic labeling. Their outputs for a single interview (I0) are rated through a small-scale human evaluation, focusing on {coherence}, {clarity}, and {relevance}. Based on the preliminary results and evaluation, BERTopic shows stronger performance and is selected for further experimentation using three {clinically oriented embedding} models. We then analyzed the full interview collection with the best model setting. Results show that domain-specific embeddings improved topic \textit{precision} and \textit{interpretability}, with BioClinicalBERT producing the most consistent results across transcripts. The global analysis of the full dataset of 13 interviews, using the BioClinicalBERT embedding model, reveals the most dominant topics throughout all 13 interviews, namely ``Coordination and Communication in Cancer Care Management" and ``Patient Decision-Making in Cancer Treatment Journey''. Although the interviews are machine translations from Dutch to English, and clinical professionals are not involved in this evaluation, the findings suggest that neural topic modeling, particularly BERTopic, can help provide useful feedback to clinicians from patient interviews. This pipeline could support more efficient document navigation and strengthen the role of patients' voices in healthcare workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12154v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inverse Rendering for High-Genus 3D Surface Meshes from Multi-view Images with Persistent Homology Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12155</link><description>arXiv:2601.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from images is inherently an ill-posed problem due to ambiguities in geometry, appearance, and topology. This paper introduces collaborative inverse rendering with persistent homology priors, a novel strategy that leverages topological constraints to resolve these ambiguities. By incorporating priors that capture critical features such as tunnel loops and handle loops, our approach directly addresses the difficulty of reconstructing high-genus surfaces. The collaboration between photometric consistency from multi-view images and homology-based guidance enables recovery of complex high-genus geometry while circumventing catastrophic failures such as collapsing tunnels or losing high-genus structure. Instead of neural networks, our method relies on gradient-based optimization within a mesh-based inverse rendering framework to highlight the role of topological priors. Experimental results show that incorporating persistent homology priors leads to lower Chamfer Distance (CD) and higher Volume IoU compared to state-of-the-art mesh-based methods, demonstrating improved geometric accuracy and robustness against topological failure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12155v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Biological Intuition on Digital Hardware: An RTL Implementation of Poisson-Encoded SNNs for Static Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12156</link><description>arXiv:2601.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence on edge devices (TinyML) is often constrained by the high power consumption and latency associated with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their reliance on intensive Matrix-Multiply (MAC) operations. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative by mimicking biological efficiency through event-driven processing. This paper presents the design and implementation of a cycle-accurate, hardware-oriented Spiking Neural Network (SNN) core implemented in SystemVerilog. Unlike conventional accelerators, this design utilizes a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model powered by fixed-point arithmetic and bit-wise primitives (shifts and additions) to eliminate the need for complex floating-point hardware. The architecture features an on-chip Poisson encoder for stochastic spike generation and a novel active pruning mechanism that dynamically disables neurons post-classification to minimize dynamic power consumption. We demonstrate the hardware's efficacy through a fully connected layer implementation targeting digit classification. Simulation results indicate that the design achieves rapid convergence (89% accuracy) within limited timesteps while maintaining a significantly reduced computational footprint compared to traditional dense architectures. This work serves as a foundational building block for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware on FPGA and ASIC platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Language You Ask In: Language-Conditioned Ideological Divergence in LLM Analysis of Contested Political Documents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12164</link><description>arXiv:2601.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as analytical tools across multilingual contexts, yet their outputs may carry systematic biases conditioned by the language of the prompt. This study presents an experimental comparison of LLM-generated political analyses of a Ukrainian civil society document, using semantically equivalent prompts in Russian and Ukrainian. Despite identical source material and parallel query structures, the resulting analyses varied substantially in rhetorical positioning, ideological orientation, and interpretive conclusions. The Russian-language output echoed narratives common in Russian state discourse, characterizing civil society actors as illegitimate elites undermining democratic mandates. The Ukrainian-language output adopted vocabulary characteristic of Western liberal-democratic political science, treating the same actors as legitimate stakeholders within democratic contestation. These findings demonstrate that prompt language alone can produce systematically different ideological orientations from identical models analyzing identical content, with significant implications for AI deployment in polarized information environments, cross-lingual research applications, and the governance of AI systems in multilingual societies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12164v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Legged MPC with Smooth Neural Surrogates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12169</link><description>arXiv:2601.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning and model predictive control (MPC) can play complementary roles in legged robotics. However, integrating learned models with online planning remains challenging. When dynamics are learned with neural networks, three key difficulties arise: (1) stiff transitions from contact events may be inherited from the data; (2) additional non-physical local nonsmoothness can occur; and (3) training datasets can induce non-Gaussian model errors due to rapid state changes. We address (1) and (2) by introducing the smooth neural surrogate, a neural network with tunable smoothness designed to provide informative predictions and derivatives for trajectory optimization through contact. To address (3), we train these models using a heavy-tailed likelihood that better matches the empirical error distributions observed in legged-robot dynamics. Together, these design choices substantially improve the reliability, scalability, and generalizability of learned legged MPC. Across zero-shot locomotion tasks of increasing difficulty, smooth neural surrogates with robust learning yield consistent reductions in cumulative cost on simple, well-conditioned behaviors (typically 10-50%), while providing substantially larger gains in regimes where standard neural dynamics often fail outright. In these regimes, smoothing enables reliable execution (from 0/5 to 5/5 success) and produces about 2-50x lower cumulative cost, reflecting orders-of-magnitude absolute improvements in robustness rather than incremental performance gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Learning for the Design of Parametric Insurance Indices under Heterogeneous Renewable Production Losses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12178</link><description>arXiv:2601.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a federated learning framework for the calibration of parametric insurance indices under heterogeneous renewable energy production losses. Producers locally model their losses using Tweedie generalized linear models and private data, while a common index is learned through federated optimization without sharing raw observations. The approach accommodates heterogeneity in variance and link functions and directly minimizes a global deviance objective in a distributed setting. We implement and compare FedAvg, FedProx and FedOpt, and benchmark them against an existing approximation-based aggregation method. An empirical application to solar power production in Germany shows that federated learning recovers comparable index coefficients under moderate heterogeneity, while providing a more general and scalable framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12178v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tolerance Principle and Small Language Model Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12179</link><description>arXiv:2601.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language models like GPT-3, BERT, and LLaMA require massive training data, yet with sufficient training they reliably learn to distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences. Children aged as young as 14 months already have the capacity to learn abstract grammar rules from very few exemplars, even in the presence of non-rule-following exceptions. Yang's (2016) Tolerance Principle defines a precise threshold for how many exceptions a rule can tolerate and still be learnable. The present study explored the minimal amount and quality of training data necessary for rules to be generalized by a transformer-based language model to test the predictions of the Tolerance Principle. We trained BabyBERTa (Huebner et al. 2021), a transformer model optimized for small datasets, on artificial grammars. The training sets varied in size, number of unique sentence types, and proportion of rule-following versus exception exemplars. We found that, unlike human infants, BabyBERTa's learning dynamics do not align with the Tolerance Principle.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VidTune: Creating Video Soundtracks with Generative Music and Contextual Thumbnails</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12180</link><description>arXiv:2601.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music shapes the tone of videos, yet creators often struggle to find soundtracks that match their video's mood and narrative. Recent text-to-music models let creators generate music from text prompts, but our formative study (N=8) shows creators struggle to construct diverse prompts, quickly review and compare tracks, and understand their impact on the video. We present VidTune, a system that supports soundtrack creation by generating diverse music options from a creator's prompt and producing contextual thumbnails for rapid review. VidTune extracts representative video subjects to ground thumbnails in context, maps each track's valence and energy onto visual cues like color and brightness, and depicts prominent genres and instruments. Creators can refine tracks through natural language edits, which VidTune expands into new generations. In a controlled user study (N=12) and an exploratory case study (N=6), participants found VidTune helpful for efficiently reviewing and comparing music options and described the process as playful and enriching.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12180v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Negotiating Digital Identities with AI Companions: Motivations, Strategies, and Emotional Outcomes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12181</link><description>arXiv:2601.12181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI companions enable deep emotional relationships by engaging a user's sense of identity, but they also pose risks like unhealthy emotional dependence. Mitigating these risks requires first understanding the underlying process of identity construction and negotiation with AI companions. Focusing on Character.AI (C.AI), a popular AI companion, we conducted an LLM-assisted thematic analysis of 22,374 online discussions on its subreddit. Using Identity Negotiation Theory as an analytical lens, we identified a three-stage process: 1) five user motivations; 2) an identity negotiation process involving three communication expectations and four identity co-construction strategies; and 3) three emotional outcomes. Our findings surface the identity work users perform as both performers and directors to co-construct identities in negotiation with C.AI. This process takes place within a socio-emotional sandbox where users can experiment with social roles and express emotions without non-human partners. Finally, we offer design implications for emotionally supporting users while mitigating the risks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aletheia: What Makes RLVR For Code Verifiers Tick?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12186</link><description>arXiv:2601.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-domain thinking verifiers trained via Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are a prominent fixture of the Large Language Model (LLM) post-training pipeline, owing to their ability to robustly rate and rerank model outputs. However, the adoption of such verifiers towards code generation has been comparatively sparse, with execution feedback constituting the dominant signal. Nonetheless, code verifiers remain valuable toward judging model outputs in scenarios where execution feedback is hard to obtain and are a potentially powerful addition to the code generation post-training toolbox. To this end, we create and open-source Aletheia, a controlled testbed that enables execution-grounded evaluation of code verifiers' robustness across disparate policy models and covariate shifts. We examine components of the RLVR-based verifier training recipe widely credited for its success: (1) intermediate thinking traces, (2) learning from negative samples, and (3) on-policy training. While experiments show the optimality of RLVR, we uncover important opportunities to simplify the recipe. Particularly, despite code verification exhibiting positive training- and inference-time scaling, on-policy learning stands out as the key component at small verifier sizes, and thinking-based training emerges as the most important component at larger scales.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VIRTUE: Versatile Video Retrieval Through Unified Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12193</link><description>arXiv:2601.12193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern video retrieval systems are expected to handle diverse tasks ranging from corpus-level retrieval and fine-grained moment localization to flexible multimodal querying. Specialized architectures achieve strong retrieval performance by training modality-specific encoders on massive datasets, but they lack the ability to process composed multimodal queries. In contrast, multimodal LLM (MLLM)-based methods support rich multimodal search but their retrieval performance remains well below that of specialized systems. We present VIRTUE, an MLLM-based versatile video retrieval framework that integrates corpus and moment-level retrieval capabilities while accommodating composed multimodal queries within a single architecture. We use contrastive alignment of visual and textual embeddings generated using a shared MLLM backbone to facilitate efficient embedding-based candidate search. Our embedding model, trained efficiently using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on 700K paired visual-text data samples, surpasses other MLLM-based methods on zero-shot video retrieval tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same model can be adapted without further training to achieve competitive results on zero-shot moment retrieval, and state of the art results for zero-shot composed video retrieval. With additional training for reranking candidates identified in the embedding-based search, our model substantially outperforms existing MLLM-based retrieval systems and achieves retrieval performance comparable to state of the art specialized models which are trained on orders of magnitude larger data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12193v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Coherent Comparison as Information Cost: A Cost-First Ledger Framework for Discrete Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12194</link><description>arXiv:2601.12194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic framework for discrete dynamics grounded in a comparison-cost functional on ratios. Given two quantities compared via their ratio \(x=a/b\), we assign a cost \(F(x)\) measuring deviation from equilibrium (\(x=1\)). Requiring coherent composition under multiplicative chaining imposes a d'Alembert functional equation; together with normalization (\(F(1)=0\)) and quadratic calibration at unity, this yields a unique reciprocal cost functional (proved in a companion paper): \[ J(x) = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(x + x^{-1}\bigr) - 1. \] This cost exhibits reciprocity \(J(x)=J(x^{-1})\), vanishes only at \(x=1\), and diverges at boundary regimes \(x\to 0^+\) and \(x\to\infty\), excluding ``nothingness'' configurations. Using \(J\) as input, we introduce a discrete ledger as a minimal lossless encoding of recognition events on directed graphs. Under deterministic update semantics and minimality (no intra-tick ordering metadata), we derive atomic ticks (at most one event per tick). Explicit structural assumptions (conservation, no sources/sinks, pairwise locality, quantization in \(\delta\mathbb{Z}\)) force balanced double-entry postings and discrete ledger units. To obtain scalar potentials on graphs with cycles while retaining single-edge impulses per tick, we impose time-aggregated cycle closure (no-arbitrage/clearing over finite windows). Under this hypothesis, cycle closure is equivalent to path-independence, and the cleared cumulative flow admits a unique scalar potential on each connected component (up to additive constant), via a discrete Poincar\'e lemma. On hypercube graphs \(Q_d\), atomicity imposes a \(2^d\)-tick minimal period, with explicit Gray-code realization at \(d=3\). The framework connects ratio-based divergences, conservative graph flows, and discrete potential theory through a coherence-forced cost structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Partial Reachability in the Internet Core</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12196</link><description>arXiv:2601.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing strives to connect all the Internet, but compete: political pressure threatens routing fragmentation; architectural changes such as private clouds, carrier-grade NAT, and firewalls make connectivity conditional; and commercial disputes create partial reachability for days or years. This paper suggests *persistent, partial reachability is fundamental to the Internet* and an underexplored problem. We first *derive a conceptual definition of the Internet core* based on connectivity, not authority. We identify *peninsulas*: persistent, partial connectivity; and *islands*: when computers are partitioned from the Internet core. Second, we develop algorithms to observe each across the Internet, and apply them to two existing measurement systems: Trinocular, where 6 locations observe 5M networks frequently, and RIPE Atlas, where 13k locations scan the DNS roots frequently. Cross-validation shows our findings are stable over *three years of data*, and consistent with as few as 3 geographically-distributed observers. We validate peninsulas and islands against CAIDA Ark, showing good recall (0.94) and bounding precision between 0.42 and 0.82. Finally, our work has broad practical impact: we show that *peninsulas are more common than Internet outages*. Factoring out peninsulas and islands as noise can *improve existing measurement systems*; their ``noise'' is $5\times$ to $9.7\times$ larger than the operational events in RIPE's DNSmon. We show that most peninsula events are routing transients (45\%), but most peninsula-time (90\%) is due to a few (7\%) long-lived events. Our work helps inform Internet policy and governance, with our neutral definition showing no single country or organization can unilaterally control the Internet core.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Embryonic Exposure to VPA Influences Chick Vocalisations: A Computational Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12203</link><description>arXiv:2601.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In young animals like poultry chicks (Gallus gallus), vocalisations convey information about affective and behavioural states. Traditional approaches to vocalisation analysis, relying on manual annotation and predefined categories, introduce biases, limit scalability, and fail to capture the full complexity of vocal repertoires. We introduce a computational framework for the automated detection, acoustic feature extraction, and unsupervised learning of chick vocalisations. Applying this framework to a dataset of newly hatched chicks, we identified two primary vocal clusters. We then tested our computational framework on an independent dataset of chicks exposed during embryonic development to vehicle or Valproic Acid (VPA), a compound that disrupts neural development and is linked to autistic-like symptoms. Clustering analysis on the experimental dataset confirmed two primary vocal clusters and revealed systematic differences between groups. VPA-exposed chicks showed an altered repertoire, with a relative increase in softer calls. VPA differentially affected call clusters, modulating temporal, frequency, and energy domain features. Overall, VPA-exposed chicks produced vocalisations with shorter duration, reduced pitch variability, and modified energy profiles, with the strongest alterations observed in louder calls. This study provides a computational framework for analysing animal vocalisations, advancing knowledge of early-life communication in typical and atypical vocal development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12203v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Neural Codecs Generalize?

Abstract: This paper investigates three crucial yet underexplored aspects of the generalization capabilities of neural audio codecs (NACs): (i) whether NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, (ii) whether speech-only pre-trained NACs can effectively generalize to non-speech applications such as environmental sounds, music, and animal vocalizations, and (iii) whether incorporating non-speech data during pre-training can improve performance on both speech and non-speech tasks. Existing studies typically rely on off-the-shelf NACs for comparison, which limits insight due to variations in implementation. In this work, we train NACs from scratch using strictly controlled configurations and carefully curated pre-training data to enable fair comparisons. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NAC performance on both signal reconstruction quality and downstream applications using 11 metrics. Our results show that NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, speech-only pre-trained NACs exhibit degraded performance on non-speech tasks, and incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves performance on non-speech tasks while maintaining comparable performance on speech tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12205v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoReflect: Conversational Evaluation via Co-Evolutionary Simulation and Reflective Rubric Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12208</link><description>arXiv:2601.12208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating conversational systems in multi-turn settings remains a fundamental challenge. Conventional pipelines typically rely on manually defined rubrics and fixed conversational context$-$a static approach that limits coverage and fails to capture the diverse, emergent behaviors of dialogue models. To address this, we introduce CoReflect (Conversational Evaluation via Co-Evolutionary Simulation and Reflective Rubric Refinement), which unifies dialogue simulation and evaluation into an adaptive, iterative process. CoReflect employs a conversation planner that generates structured templates to guide a user simulator through diverse, goal-directed dialogues. Subsequently, a reflective analyzer processes these dialogues to identify systematic behavioral patterns and automatically refine the evaluation rubrics. Crucially, the insights from the conversation analysis are fed back into the planner to update conversation templates for subsequent iterations. This co-evolution loop ensures that the complexity of test cases and the diagnostic precision of rubrics improve in tandem. By minimizing human intervention, CoReflect provides a scalable and self-refining methodology that allows evaluation protocols to adapt alongside the rapidly advancing capabilities of dialogue models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DaggerFFT: A Distributed FFT Framework Using Task Scheduling in Julia</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12209</link><description>arXiv:2601.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental numerical technique with widespread application in a range of scientific problems. As scientific simulations attempt to exploit exascale systems, there has been a growing demand for distributed FFT algorithms that can effectively utilize modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Conventional FFT algorithms commonly encounter performance bottlenecks, especially when run on heterogeneous platforms. Most distributed FFT approaches rely on static task distribution and require synchronization barriers, limiting scalability and impacting overall resource utilization. In this paper we present DaggerFFT, a distributed FFT framework, developed in Julia, that treats highly parallel FFT computations as a dynamically scheduled task graph. Each FFT stage operates on a separately defined distributed array. FFT operations are expressed as DTasks operating on pencil or slab partitioned DArrays. Each FFT stage owns its own DArray, and the runtime assigns DTasks across devices using Dagger's dynamic scheduler that uses work stealing. We demonstrate how DaggerFFT's dynamic scheduler can outperform state-of-the-art distributed FFT libraries on both CPU and GPU backends, achieving up to a 2.6x speedup on CPU clusters and up to a 1.35x speedup on GPU clusters. We have integrated DaggerFFT into Oceananigans.jl, a geophysical fluid dynamics framework, demonstrating that high-level, task-based runtimes can deliver both superior performance and modularity in large-scale, real-world simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12209v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Solvability of The Output Corridor Control Problem by Pulse-Modulated Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12210</link><description>arXiv:2601.12210v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Inference time latency has remained an open challenge for real world applications of large language models (LLMs). State-of-the-art (SOTA) speculative sampling (SpS) methods for LLMs, like EAGLE-3, use tree-based drafting to explore multiple candidate continuations in parallel. However, the hyperparameters controlling the tree structure are static, which limits flexibility and efficiency across diverse contexts and domains. We introduce Reinforcement learning for Speculative Sampling (Re-SpS), the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for draft tree hyperparameter optimization. Re-SpS dynamically adjusts draft tree hyperparameters in real-time, learning context-aware policies that maximize generation speed by balancing speculative aggression with computational overhead. It leverages efficient state representations from target model hidden states and introduces multi-step action persistence for better context modeling. Evaluation results across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the SOTA method EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.45$\times$ speedup over the backbone LLM and up to 1.12$\times$ speedup compared to EAGLE-3 across five diverse benchmarks, with no loss in output fidelity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12212v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One-Sided Matrix Completion from Ultra-Sparse Samples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12213</link><description>arXiv:2601.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix completion is a classical problem that has received recurring interest across a wide range of fields. In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\top} M / n$.
  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \ge O({d r^5 \epsilon^{-2} C^{-2} \log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $\epsilon^2$.
  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach. On three MovieLens datasets, our algorithm reduces bias by $88\%$ relative to baseline estimators. We also empirically validate the linear sampling complexity of $n$ relative to $d$ on synthetic data. On an Amazon reviews dataset with sparsity $10^{-7}$, our method reduces the recovery error of $T$ by $59\%$ and $M$ by $38\%$ compared to baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12213v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wavelet-Driven Masked Multiscale Reconstruction for PPG Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12215</link><description>arXiv:2601.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable foundation models have the potential to transform digital health by learning transferable representations from large-scale biosignals collected in everyday settings. While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Canonicalization of Batched Einstein Summations for Tuning Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12220</link><description>arXiv:2601.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for normalizing \emph{Batched Einstein Summation}
  expressions by mapping mathematically equivalent formulations to a unique
  normal form. Batches of einsums with the same Einstein notation that exhibit
  substantial data reuse appear frequently in finite element methods (FEM),
  numerical linear algebra, and computational chemistry. To effectively exploit
  this temporal locality for high performance, we consider groups of einsums in
  batched form.
  Representations of equivalent batched einsums may differ due to index
  renaming, permutations within the batch, and, due to the commutativity and
  associativity of multiplication operation. The lack of a canonical
  representation hinders the reuse of optimization and tuning knowledge in
  software systems. To this end, we develop a novel encoding of batched einsums
  as colored graphs and apply graph canonicalization to derive a normal form.
  In addition to the canonicalization algorithm, we propose a representation of
  einsums using functional array operands and provide a strategy to transfer
  transformations operating on the normal form to \emph{functional batched
  einsums} that exhibit the same normal form; crucial for fusing surrounding

Abstract: Music generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding music content, necessitating automated song aesthetics evaluation. However, existing studies largely focus on speech, audio or singing quality, leaving song aesthetics underexplored. Moreover, conventional approaches often predict a precise Mean Opinion Score (MOS) value directly, which struggles to capture the nuances of human perception in song aesthetics evaluation. This paper proposes a song-oriented aesthetics evaluation framework, featuring two novel modules: 1) Multi-Stem Attention Fusion (MSAF) builds bidirectional cross-attention between mixture-vocal and mixture-accompaniment pairs, fusing them to capture complex musical features; 2) Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Interval Aggregation (HiGIA) learns multi-granularity score probability distributions, aggregates them into a score interval, and applies a regression within the interval to produce the final score. We evaluated on two datasets of full-length songs: SongEval dataset (AI-generated) and an internal aesthetics dataset (human-created), and compared with two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the proposed method achieves stronger performance for multi-dimensional song aesthetics evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12222v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Where It Moves, It Matters: Referring Surgical Instrument Segmentation via Motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12224</link><description>arXiv:2601.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction with surgical scenes is a critical step toward intelligent operating rooms and autonomous surgical robotic assistance. However, the task of referring segmentation, localizing surgical instruments based on natural language descriptions, remains underexplored in surgical videos, with existing approaches struggling to generalize due to reliance on static visual cues and predefined instrument names. In this work, we introduce SurgRef, a novel motion-guided framework that grounds free-form language expressions in instrument motion, capturing how tools move and interact across time, rather than what they look like. This allows models to understand and segment instruments even under occlusion, ambiguity, or unfamiliar terminology. To train and evaluate SurgRef, we present Ref-IMotion, a diverse, multi-institutional video dataset with dense spatiotemporal masks and rich motion-centric expressions. SurgRef achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization across surgical procedures, setting a new benchmark for robust, language-driven surgical video segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Longitudinal Health Representations from EHR and Wearable Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12227</link><description>arXiv:2601.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models trained on electronic health records show strong performance on many clinical prediction tasks but are limited by sparse and irregular documentation. Wearable devices provide dense continuous physiological signals but lack semantic grounding. Existing methods usually model these data sources separately or combine them through late fusion. We propose a multimodal foundation model that jointly represents electronic health records and wearable data as a continuous time latent process. The model uses modality specific encoders and a shared temporal backbone pretrained with self supervised and cross modal objectives. This design produces representations that are temporally coherent and clinically grounded. Across forecasting physiological and risk modeling tasks the model outperforms strong electronic health record only and wearable only baselines especially at long horizons and under missing data. These results show that joint electronic health record and wearable pretraining yields more faithful representations of longitudinal health.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wavelet-Aware Anomaly Detection in Multi-Channel User Logs via Deviation Modulation and Resolution-Adaptive Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12231</link><description>arXiv:2601.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider threat detection is a key challenge in enterprise security, relying on user activity logs that capture rich and complex behavioral patterns. These logs are often multi-channel, non-stationary, and anomalies are rare, making anomaly detection challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates wavelet-aware modulation, multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, and resolution-adaptive attention for robust anomaly detection. Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies. Finally, a learnable attention mechanism dynamically reweights the most discriminative frequency bands for detection. On the CERT r4.2 benchmark, our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in precision, recall, and F1 score across various time granularities and scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffusionQC: Artifact Detection in Histopathology via Diffusion Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12233</link><description>arXiv:2601.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital pathology plays a vital role across modern medicine, offering critical insights for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. However, histopathology images often contain artifacts introduced during slide preparation and digitization. Detecting and excluding them is essential to ensure reliable downstream analysis. Traditional supervised models typically require large annotated datasets, which is resource-intensive and not generalizable to novel artifact types. To address this, we propose DiffusionQC, which detects artifacts as outliers among clean images using a diffusion model. It requires only a set of clean images for training rather than pixel-level artifact annotations and predefined artifact types. Furthermore, we introduce a contrastive learning module to explicitly enlarge the distribution separation between artifact and clean images, yielding an enhanced version of our method. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance to state-of-the-art and offer cross-stain generalization capacity, with significantly less data and annotations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12233v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Proc3D: Procedural 3D Generation and Parametric Editing of 3D Shapes with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12234</link><description>arXiv:2601.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating 3D models has traditionally been a complex task requiring specialized expertise. While recent advances in generative AI have sought to automate this process, existing methods produce non-editable representation, such as meshes or point clouds, limiting their adaptability for iterative design. In this paper, we introduce Proc3D, a system designed to generate editable 3D models while enabling real-time modifications. At its core, Proc3D introduces procedural compact graph (PCG), a graph representation of 3D models, that encodes the algorithmic rules and structures necessary for generating the model. This representation exposes key parameters, allowing intuitive manual adjustments via sliders and checkboxes, as well as real-time, automated modifications through natural language prompts using Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate Proc3D's capabilities using two generative approaches: GPT-4o with in-context learning (ICL) and a fine-tuned LLAMA-3 model. Experimental results show that Proc3D outperforms existing methods in editing efficiency, achieving more than 400x speedup over conventional approaches that require full regeneration for each modification. Additionally, Proc3D improves ULIP scores by 28%, a metric that evaluates the alignment between generated 3D models and text prompts. By enabling text-aligned 3D model generation along with precise, real-time parametric edits, Proc3D facilitates highly accurate text-based image editing applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12234v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Power Aware Dynamic Reallocation For Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12241</link><description>arXiv:2601.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disaggregation has emerged as a powerful strategy for optimizing large language model (LLM) inference by separating compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases across specialized GPUs. This separation improves utilization and throughput under fixed hardware capacity. However, as model and cluster scales grow, power, rather than compute, has become the dominant limiter of overall performance and cost efficiency. In this paper, we propose RAPID, a power-aware disaggregated inference framework that jointly manages GPU roles and power budgets to sustain goodput within strict power caps. RAPID utilizes static and dynamic power reallocation in addition to GPU reallocation to improve performance under fixed power bounds. RAPID improves overall performance and application consistency beyond what is achievable in current disaggregation solutions, resulting in up to a 2x improvement in SLO attainment at peak load when compared to a static assignment without an increase in complexity or cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12241v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal Power Allocation and Sub-Optimal Channel Assignment for Downlink NOMA Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12242</link><description>arXiv:2601.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) system has emerged as a promising candidate for multiple access frameworks due to the evolution of deep machine learning, trying to incorporate deep machine learning into the NOMA system. The main motivation for such active studies is the growing need to optimize the utilization of network resources as the expansion of the internet of things (IoT) caused a scarcity of network resources. The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning. Also, we provide extensive simulations to evaluate the effects of varying the learning rate, batch size, type of model, and the number of features in the state.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12242v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Less is More: Label-Guided Summarization of Procedural and Instructional Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12243</link><description>arXiv:2601.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video summarization helps turn long videos into clear, concise representations that are easier to review, document, and analyze, especially in high-stakes domains like surgical training. Prior work has progressed from using basic visual features like color, motion, and structural changes to using pre-trained vision-language models that can better understand what's happening in the video (semantics) and capture temporal flow, resulting in more context-aware video summarization. We propose a three-stage framework, PRISM: Procedural Representation via Integrated Semantic and Multimodal analysis, that produces semantically grounded video summaries. PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and contextual validation using a large language model (LLM). Our method ensures that selected frames reflect meaningful and procedural transitions while filtering out generic or hallucinated content, resulting in contextually coherent summaries across both domain-specific and instructional videos. We evaluate our method on instructional and activity datasets, using reference summaries for instructional videos. Despite sampling fewer than 5% of the original frames, our summaries retain 84% semantic content while improving over baselines by as much as 33%. Our approach generalizes across procedural and domain-specific video tasks, achieving strong performance with both semantic alignment and precision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12243v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Comprehensive Review of Bio-Inspired Approaches to Coordination, Communication, and System Architecture in Underwater Swarm Robotics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12244</link><description>arXiv:2601.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of marine operations has intensified the need for intelligent robotic systems to support ocean observation, exploration, and resource management. Underwater swarm robotics offers a promising framework that extends the capabilities of individual autonomous platforms through collective coordination. Inspired by natural systems, such as fish schools and insect colonies, bio-inspired swarm approaches enable distributed decision-making, adaptability, and resilience under challenging marine conditions. Yet research in this field remains fragmented, with limited integration across algorithmic, communication, and hardware design perspectives. This review synthesises bio-inspired coordination mechanisms, communication strategies, and system design considerations for underwater swarm robotics. It examines key marine-specific algorithms, including the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm, Whale Optimisation Algorithm, Coral Reef Optimisation, and Marine Predators Algorithm, highlighting their applications in formation control, task allocation, and environmental interaction. The review also analyses communication constraints unique to the underwater domain and emerging acoustic, optical, and hybrid solutions that support cooperative operation. Additionally, it examines hardware and system design advances that enhance system efficiency and scalability. A multi-dimensional classification framework evaluates existing approaches across communication dependency, environmental adaptability, energy efficiency, and swarm scalability. Through this integrated analysis, the review unifies bio-inspired coordination algorithms, communication modalities, and system design approaches. It also identifies converging trends, key challenges, and future research directions for real-world deployment of underwater swarm systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12244v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sound2Hap: Learning Audio-to-Vibrotactile Haptic Generation from Human Ratings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12245</link><description>arXiv:2601.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental sounds like footsteps, keyboard typing, or dog barking carry rich information and emotional context, making them valuable for designing haptics in user applications. Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12245v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explicit symmetric low-regularity integrators for the semilinear Klein-Gordon equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12246</link><description>arXiv:2601.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the design and analysis of symmetric low-regularity integrators for the semilinear Klein-Gordon equation. We first propose a general symmetrization procedure that allows for the systematic construction of symmetric schemes from existing explicit (non-symmetric) integrators. Applying this procedure, we derive two novel schemes. Error analyses show that both integrators achieve their optimal convergence orders in the energy space under significantly relaxed regularity assumptions. Furthermore, the symmetry property ensures that the convergence order of a first-order symmetric scheme improves as the regularity of the exact solution increases. A numerical experiment demonstrates that the proposed second-order symmetric scheme nearly preserves the system energy over extended periods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12246v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Plan, Verify and Fill: A Structured Parallel Decoding Approach for Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12247</link><description>arXiv:2601.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) present a promising non-sequential paradigm for text generation, distinct from standard autoregressive (AR) approaches. However, current decoding strategies often adopt a reactive stance, underutilizing the global bidirectional context to dictate global trajectories. To address this, we propose Plan-Verify-Fill (PVF), a training-free paradigm that grounds planning via quantitative validation. PVF actively constructs a hierarchical skeleton by prioritizing high-leverage semantic anchors and employs a verification protocol to operationalize pragmatic structural stopping where further deliberation yields diminishing returns. Extensive evaluations on LLaDA-8B-Instruct and Dream-7B-Instruct demonstrate that PVF reduces the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) by up to 65% compared to confidence-based parallel decoding across benchmark datasets, unlocking superior efficiency without compromising accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Innovative Framework for Breast Cancer Detection Using Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution, Transformer Integration, and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12249</link><description>arXiv:2601.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, and its accurate and timely diagnosis plays a critical role in improving treatment outcomes. This thesis presents an innovative framework for detecting malignant masses in mammographic images by integrating the Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution (PAAC) and Transformer architectures. The proposed approach utilizes Multi-Scale Feature Fusion to enhance the extraction of features from benign and malignant tissues and combines Dice Loss and Focal Loss functions to improve the model's learning process, effectively reducing errors in binary breast cancer classification and achieving high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, a comprehensive dataset of breast cancer images from INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM was preprocessed through data augmentation and contrast enhancement and resized to 227x227 pixels for model training. Leveraging the Transformer's ability to manage long-range dependencies with Self-Attention mechanisms, the proposed model achieved high accuracy in detecting cancerous masses, outperforming foundational models such as BreastNet, DeepMammo, Multi-Scale CNN, Swin-Unet, and SegFormer. The final evaluation results for the proposed model include an accuracy of 98.5\%, sensitivity of 97.8\%, specificity of 96.3\%, F1-score of 98.2\%, and overall precision of 97.9\%. These metrics demonstrate a significant improvement over traditional methods and confirm the model's effectiveness in identifying cancerous masses in complex scenarios and large datasets. This model shows potential as a reliable and efficient tool for breast cancer diagnosis and can be effectively integrated into medical diagnostic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12249v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking Coordinate Overfitting: Geometry-Aware WiFi Sensing for Cross-Layout 3D Pose Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12252</link><description>arXiv:2601.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based 3D human pose estimation offers a low-cost and privacy-preserving alternative to vision-based systems for smart interaction. However, existing approaches rely on visual 3D poses as supervision and directly regress CSI to a camera-based coordinate system. We find that this practice leads to coordinate overfitting: models memorize deployment-specific WiFi transceiver layouts rather than only learning activity-relevant representations, resulting in severe generalization failures. To address this challenge, we present PerceptAlign, the first geometry-conditioned framework for WiFi-based cross-layout pose estimation. PerceptAlign introduces a lightweight coordinate unification procedure that aligns WiFi and vision measurements in a shared 3D space using only two checkerboards and a few photos. Within this unified space, it encodes calibrated transceiver positions into high-dimensional embeddings and fuses them with CSI features, making the model explicitly aware of device geometry as a conditional variable. This design forces the network to disentangle human motion from deployment layouts, enabling robust and, for the first time, layout-invariant WiFi pose estimation. To support systematic evaluation, we construct the largest cross-domain 3D WiFi pose estimation dataset to date, comprising 21 subjects, 5 scenes, 18 actions, and 7 device layouts. Experiments show that PerceptAlign reduces in-domain error by 12.3% and cross-domain error by more than 60% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results establish geometry-conditioned learning as a viable path toward scalable and practical WiFi sensing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12252v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Joint Learning for Domain and Class Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12253</link><description>arXiv:2601.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of visual-language models like CLIP has become crucial due to their large-scale parameter size and extensive pretraining requirements.

In this paper, we propose \textbf{Fed}erated Joint Learning for \textbf{D}omain and \textbf{C}lass \textbf{G}eneralization, termed \textbf{FedDCG}, a novel approach that addresses both class and domain generalization in federated learning settings. Our method introduces a domain grouping strategy where class-generalized networks are trained within each group to prevent decision boundary confusion. During inference, we aggregate class-generalized results based on domain similarity, effectively integrating knowledge from both class and domain generalization. Specifically, a learnable network is employed to enhance class generalization capabilities, and a decoupling mechanism separates general and domain-specific knowledge, improving generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments across various datasets show that \textbf{FedDCG} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12253v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Confidence-based Filtering for Speech Dataset Curation with Generative Speech Enhancement Using Discrete Tokens</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12254</link><description>arXiv:2601.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative speech enhancement (GSE) models show great promise in producing high-quality clean speech from noisy inputs, enabling applications such as curating noisy text-to-speech (TTS) datasets into high-quality ones. However, GSE models are prone to hallucination errors, such as phoneme omissions and speaker inconsistency, which conventional error filtering based on non-intrusive speech quality metrics often fails to detect. To address this issue, we propose a non-intrusive method for filtering hallucination errors from discrete token-based GSE models. Our method leverages the log-probabilities of generated tokens as confidence scores to detect potential errors. Experimental results show that the confidence scores strongly correlate with a suite of intrusive SE metrics, and that our method effectively identifies hallucination errors missed by conventional filtering methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our method: curating an in-the-wild TTS dataset with our confidence-based filtering improves the performance of subsequently trained TTS models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12254v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Large Molecular Language Model via Relation-aware Multimodal Collaboration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12256</link><description>arXiv:2601.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their instruction-following capabilities and achieved powerful performance on various tasks. Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations. Furthermore, we present a molecule-centric new automatic measurement, including a hallucination assessment metric and GPT-based caption quality evaluation to address the limitations of token-based generic evaluation metrics (i.e., BLEU) widely used in assessing molecular comprehension of LMLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoLLaMo enhances the molecular modality generalization capabilities of LMLMs, achieving the best performance on multiple tasks, including molecule captioning, computed property QA, descriptive property QA, motif counting, and IUPAC name prediction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12256v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Soft Shadow Diffusion (SSD): Physics-inspired Learning for 3D Computational Periscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12257</link><description>arXiv:2601.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional imaging requires a line of sight to create accurate visual representations of a scene. In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \textit{light-occluding} and \textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FutureX-Pro: Extending Future Prediction to High-Value Vertical Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12259</link><description>arXiv:2601.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon FutureX, which established a live benchmark for general-purpose future prediction, this report introduces FutureX-Pro, including FutureX-Finance, FutureX-Retail, FutureX-PublicHealth, FutureX-NaturalDisaster, and FutureX-Search.

Abstract: Document understanding (VRDU) in regulated domains is particularly challenging, since scanned documents often contain sensitive, evolving, and domain specific knowledge. This leads to two major challenges: the lack of manual annotations for model adaptation and the difficulty for pretrained models to stay up-to-date with domain-specific facts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains. We introduce Docs2Synth, a synthetic-supervision framework that enables retrieval-guided inference for private and low-resource domains. Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency. We further deliver Docs2Synth as an easy-to-use Python package, enabling plug-and-play deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. Experiments on multiple VRDU benchmarks show that Docs2Synth substantially enhances grounding and domain generalization without requiring human annotations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12260v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Environment-Aware Code Generation: How far are We?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12262</link><description>arXiv:2601.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has improved code generation, but most evaluations still test isolated, small-scale code (e.g., a single function) under default or unspecified software environments. As a result, it is unclear whether LLMs can reliably generate executable code tailored to a user's specific environment. We present the first systematic study of Environment-Aware Code Generation (EACG), where generated code must be functionally correct and directly executable under arbitrary software configurations. To enable realistic evaluation, we introduce VersiBCB, a benchmark that is multi-package, execution-verified, and deprecation-aware, capturing complex and evolving environments that prior datasets often overlook. Using VersiBCB, we investigate three complementary adaptation axes: data, parameters, and cache, and develop representative strategies for each. Our results show that current LLMs struggle with environment-specific code generation, while our adaptations improve environment compatibility and executability. These findings highlight key challenges and opportunities for deploying LLMs in practical software engineering workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization: Rank Manipulation for Vision-Language Model Rankers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12263</link><description>arXiv:2601.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are rapidly replacing unimodal encoders in modern retrieval and recommendation systems. While their capabilities are well-documented, their robustness against adversarial manipulation in competitive ranking scenarios remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we uncover a critical vulnerability in VLM-based product search: multimodal ranking attacks. We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes. Unlike existing attacks that treat modalities in isolation, MGEO employs an alternating gradient-based optimization strategy to exploit the deep cross-modal coupling within the VLM. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets using state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our coordinated attack significantly outperforms text-only and image-only baselines. These findings reveal that multimodal synergy, typically a strength of VLMs, can be weaponized to compromise the integrity of search rankings without triggering conventional content filters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12263v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Opportunistic Scheduling for Optimal Spot Instance Savings in the Cloud</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12266</link><description>arXiv:2601.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling delay-sensitive jobs over spot and on-demand cloud instances to minimize average cost while meeting an average delay constraint. Jobs arrive as a general stochastic process, and incur different costs based on the instance type. This work provides the first analytical treatment of this problem using tools from queuing theory, stochastic processes, and optimization. We derive cost expressions for general policies, prove queue length one is optimal for low target delays, and characterize the optimal wait-time distribution. For high target delays, we identify a knapsack structure and design a scheduling policy that exploits it. An adaptive algorithm is proposed to fully utilize the allowed delay, and empirical results confirm its near-optimality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simulated Annealing Enhances Theory-of-Mind Reasoning in Autoregressive Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12269</link><description>arXiv:2601.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive language models are next-token predictors and have been criticized for only optimizing surface plausibility (i.e., local coherence) rather than maintaining correct latent-state representations (i.e., global coherence). Because Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks crucially depend on reasoning about latent mental states of oneself and others, such models are therefore often thought to fail at ToM. While post-training methods can improve ToM performance, we show that strong ToM capability can be recovered directly from the base model without any additional weight updates or verifications. Our approach builds on recent power-sampling methods (Karan &amp; Du, 2025) that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from sharpened sequence-level (rather than token-level) probability distributions of autoregressive language models. We further find that incorporating annealing, where the tempered distribution is gradually shifted from high to low temperature, substantially improves ToM performance over fixed-temperature power sampling. Together, these results suggest that sampling-based optimization provides a powerful way to extract latent capabilities from language models without retraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12269v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SplittingSecrets: A Compiler-Based Defense for Preventing Data Memory-Dependent Prefetcher Side-Channels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12270</link><description>arXiv:2601.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional side-channels take advantage of secrets being used as inputs to unsafe instructions, used for memory accesses, or used in control flow decisions. Constant-time programming, which restricts such code patterns, has been widely adopted as a defense against these vulnerabilities. However, new hardware optimizations in the form of Data Memory-dependent Prefetchers (DMP) present in Apple, Intel, and ARM CPUs have shown such defenses are not sufficient. These prefetchers, unlike classical prefetchers, use the content of memory as well as the trace of prior accesses to determine prefetch targets. An adversary abusing such a prefetcher has been shown to be able to mount attacks leaking data-at-rest; data that is never used by the program, even speculatively, in an unsafe manner.
  In response, this paper introduces SplittingSecrets, a compiler-based tool that can harden software libraries against side-channels arising from DMPs. SplittingSecrets's approach avoids reasoning about the complex internals of different DMPs and instead relies on one key aspect of all DMPs: activation requires data to resemble addresses. To prevent secret data from leaking, SplittingSecrets transforms memory operations to ensure that secrets are never stored in memory in a manner resembling an address, thereby avoiding DMP activation on those secrets. Rather than disable a DMP entirely, SplittingSecrets can provide targeted hardening for only specific secrets entirely in software.
  We have implemented SplittingSecrets using LLVM, supporting both source-level memory operations and those generated by the compiler backend for the AArch64 architecture, We have analyzed the performance overhead involved in safeguarding secrets from DMP-induced attacks using common primitives in libsodium, a popular cryptographic library when built for Apple M-series CPUs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12270v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgenticPruner: MAC-Constrained Neural Network Compression via LLM-Driven Strategy Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12272</link><description>arXiv:2601.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network pruning remains essential for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices, yet existing approaches primarily target parameter reduction without directly controlling computational cost. This yields unpredictable inference latency in deployment scenarios where strict Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation budgets must be met. We propose AgenticPruner, a framework utilizing large language models to achieve MAC-constrained optimization through iterative strategy learning. Our approach coordinates three specialized agents: a Profiling Agent that analyzes model architecture and MAC distributions, a Master Agent that orchestrates the workflow with divergence monitoring, and an Analysis Agent powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet that learns optimal strategies from historical attempts. Through in-context learning, the Analysis Agent improves convergence success rate from 48% to 71% compared to grid search. Building upon isomorphic pruning's graph-based structural grouping, our method adds context-aware adaptation by analyzing patterns across pruning iterations, enabling automatic convergence to target MAC budgets within user-defined tolerance bands.
  We validate our framework on ImageNet-1K across ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DeiT architectures. On CNNs, our approach achieves MAC targeting while maintaining or improving accuracy: ResNet-50 reaches 1.77G MACs with 77.04% accuracy (+0.91% vs baseline); ResNet-101 achieves 4.22G MACs with 78.94% accuracy (+1.56% vs baseline). For ConvNeXt-Small, pruning to 8.17G MACs yields 1.41x GPU and 1.07x CPU speedup with 45% parameter reduction. On Vision Transformers, we demonstrate MAC-budget compliance within user-defined tolerance bands (typically +1% to +5% overshoot, -5% to -15% undershoot), establishing feasibility for deployment scenarios requiring strict computational guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12272v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Mutation Analysis for LLM-based Repair of Quantum Programs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12273</link><description>arXiv:2601.12273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques specifically designed for quantum programs have been proposed. However, existing approaches often suffer from low repair success rates or poor understandability of the generated patches. In this study, we construct a framework in which a large language model (LLM) generates code repairs along with a natural language explanation of the applied repairs. To investigate how the contextual information included in prompts influences APR performance for quantum programs, we design four prompt configurations with different combinations of static information, dynamic information, and mutation analysis results. Mutation analysis evaluates how small changes to specific parts of a program affect its execution results and provides more detailed dynamic information than simple execution outputs such as stack traces. Our experimental results show that mutation analysis can provide valuable contextual information for LLM-based APR of quantum programs, improving repair success rates (achieving 94.4% in our experiment) and in some cases also improving the quality of generated explanations. Our findings point toward new directions for developing APR techniques for quantum programs that enhance both reliability and explainability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Concolic Testing with Large Language Models for Guided Path Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12274</link><description>arXiv:2601.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concolic testing, a powerful hybrid software testing technique, has historically been plagued by fundamental limitations such as path explosion and the high cost of constraint solving, which hinder its practical application in large-scale, real-world software systems. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework that synergistically integrates concolic execution with Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome these challenges. Our hybrid approach leverages the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide path exploration, prioritize interesting execution paths, and assist in constraint solving. We formally define the system architecture and algorithms that constitute this new paradigm. Through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real-world Fintech applications, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms traditional concolic testing, random testing, and genetic algorithm-based methods in terms of branch coverage, path coverage, and time-to-coverage. The results indicate that by combining the strengths of both concolic execution and LLMs, our method achieves a more efficient and effective exploration of the program state space, leading to improved bug detection capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12274v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predictive Prototyping: Evaluating Design Concepts with ChatGPT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12276</link><description>arXiv:2601.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design-build-test cycle is essential for innovation, but physical prototyping is often slow and expensive. Although physics-based simulation and strategic prototyping can reduce cost, meaningful evaluation is frequently constrained until an integrated prototype is built. This paper investigates whether a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) can predict information typically obtained through prototyping, including cost, performance, and perceived usability. We introduce a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to emulate design feedback using OpenAI GPT-4o, grounded in prototyping data scraped from Instructables.com to increase access to relevant precedent. Two studies are reported. First, a controlled experiment compares GPT-RAG and human designers, who receive design sketches and predict cost, performance, and usability; predictions are evaluated against ground-truth results from physical prototypes. Second, we report an applied demonstration in which a physical prototype is produced from GPT-RAG recommendations and compared with a commercial baseline and a topology-optimized design. Results show that GPT-RAG provides more accurate cost and performance estimates than individual or crowd human estimates, while yielding comparable usability insights; the GPT-RAG-informed prototype also outperforms both comparison prototypes. Repeated querying with response averaging significantly improves accuracy, suggesting that LLMs can emulate crowd aggregation effects consistent with the law of large numbers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12276v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Efficient and Multi-Modal Navigation System with One-Step World Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12277</link><description>arXiv:2601.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capability for mobile robots. While the current trend is to use learning-based approaches to replace traditional geometry-based methods, existing end-to-end learning-based policies often struggle with 3D spatial reasoning and lack a comprehensive understanding of physical world dynamics. Integrating world models-which predict future observations conditioned on given actions-with iterative optimization planning offers a promising solution due to their capacity for imagination and flexibility. However, current navigation world models, typically built on pure transformer architectures, often rely on multi-step diffusion processes and autoregressive frame-by-frame generation. These mechanisms result in prohibitive computational latency, rendering real-time deployment impossible. To address this bottleneck, we propose a lightweight navigation world model that adopts a one-step generation paradigm and a 3D U-Net backbone equipped with efficient spatial-temporal attention. This design drastically reduces inference latency, enabling high-frequency control while achieving superior predictive performance. We also integrate this model into an optimization-based planning framework utilizing anchor-based initialization to handle multi-modal goal navigation tasks. Extensive closed-loop experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate our system's superior efficiency and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12277v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HCFT: Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer for EEG Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12279</link><description>arXiv:2601.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) decoding requires models that can effectively extract and integrate complex temporal, spectral, and spatial features from multichannel signals. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that each core component of the proposed framework contributes significantly to the overall decoding performance, demonstrating HCFT's effectiveness in capturing EEG dynamics and its potential for real-world BCI applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12279v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Democratizing Music Therapy: LLM-Based Automated EEG Analysis and Progress Tracking for Low-Cost Home Devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12280</link><description>arXiv:2601.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Home-based music therapy devices require accessible and cost-effective solutions for users to understand and track their therapeutic progress. Traditional physiological signal analysis, particularly EEG interpretation, relies heavily on domain experts, creating barriers to scalability and home adoption. Meanwhile, few experts are capable of interpreting physiological signal data while also making targeted music recommendations. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, their application to automated physiological report generation for music therapy represents an unexplored task. We present a prototype system that leverages LLMs to bridge this gap -- transforming raw EEG and cardiovascular data into human-readable therapeutic reports and personalized music recommendations. Unlike prior work focusing on real-time physiological adaptation during listening, our approach emphasizes post-session analysis and interpretable reporting, enabling non-expert users to comprehend their psychophysiological states and track therapeutic outcomes over time. By integrating signal processing modules with LLM-based reasoning agents, the system provides a practical and low-cost solution for short-term progress monitoring in home music therapy contexts. This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying LLMs to a novel task -- democratizing access to physiology-driven music therapy through automated, interpretable reporting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CytoCLIP: Learning Cytoarchitectural Characteristics in Developing Human Brain Using Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12282</link><description>arXiv:2601.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functions of different regions of the human brain are closely linked to their distinct cytoarchitecture, which is defined by the spatial arrangement and morphology of the cells. Identifying brain regions by their cytoarchitecture enables various scientific analyses of the brain. However, delineating these areas manually in brain histological sections is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge. An automated approach is necessary to minimize the effort needed from human experts. To address this, we propose CytoCLIP, a suite of vision-language models derived from pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) frameworks to learn joint visual-text representations of brain cytoarchitecture. CytoCLIP comprises two model variants: one is trained using low-resolution whole-region images to understand the overall cytoarchitectural pattern of an area, and the other is trained on high-resolution image tiles for detailed cellular-level representation. The training dataset is created from NISSL-stained histological sections of developing fetal brains of different gestational weeks. It includes 86 distinct regions for low-resolution images and 384 brain regions for high-resolution tiles. We evaluate the model's understanding of the cytoarchitecture and generalization ability using region classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Multiple experiments are performed under various data setups, including data from samples of different ages and sectioning planes. Experimental results demonstrate that CytoCLIP outperforms existing methods. It achieves an F1 score of 0.87 for whole-region classification and 0.91 for high-resolution image tile classification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12282v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SDiT: Semantic Region-Adaptive for Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12283</link><description>arXiv:2601.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image synthesis but remain computationally expensive due to the iterative nature of denoising and the quadratic cost of global attention. In this work, we observe that denoising dynamics are spatially non-uniform-background regions converge rapidly while edges and textured areas evolve much more actively. Building on this insight, we propose SDiT, a Semantic Region-Adaptive Diffusion Transformer that allocates computation according to regional complexity. SDiT introduces a training-free framework combining (1) semantic-aware clustering via fast Quickshift-based segmentation, (2) complexity-driven regional scheduling to selectively update informative areas, and (3) boundary-aware refinement to maintain spatial coherence. Without any model retraining or architectural modification, SDiT achieves up to 3.0x acceleration while preserving nearly identical perceptual and semantic quality to full-attention inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12283v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Safe Is Your Data in Connected and Autonomous Cars: A Consumer Advantage or a Privacy Nightmare ?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12284</link><description>arXiv:2601.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the automobile sector, driven by advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), has transformed how vehicles communicate, operate, and interact with their surroundings. Technologies such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication enable autonomous cars to generate and exchange substantial amounts of data with real-world entities, enhancing safety, improving performance, and delivering personalized user experiences. However, this data-driven ecosystem introduces significant challenges, particularly concerning data privacy, security, and governance. The absence of transparency and comprehensive regulatory frameworks exacerbates issues of unauthorized data access, prolonged retention, and potential misuse, creating tension between consumer benefits and privacy risks. This review paper explores the multifaceted nature of data sharing in CAVs, analyzing its contributions to innovation and its associated vulnerabilities. It evaluates data-sharing mechanisms and communication technologies, highlights the benefits of data exchange across various use cases, examines privacy concerns and risks of data misuse, and critically reviews regulatory frameworks and their inadequacies in safeguarding user privacy. By providing a thorough analysis of the current state of data sharing in the automotive sector, the paper emphasizes the urgent need for robust policies and ethical data management practices. It calls for striking a balance between fostering technological advancements and ensuring secure, consumer-friendly solutions, paving the way for a trustworthy and innovative automotive future.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LegacyAvatars: Volumetric Face Avatars For Traditional Graphics Pipelines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12285</link><description>arXiv:2601.12285v1 Announce Type: new

During deployment, this allows us to control and animate the face through simple linear blending and alpha compositing of textures over a static mesh. This explicit representation also enables the generated avatar to be efficiently streamed online and then rendered using classical mesh and shader-based rendering on legacy graphics platforms, eliminating the need for any custom engineering or integration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conversational Context Classification: A Representation Engineering Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12286</link><description>arXiv:2601.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demands effective safeguards for their operation, particularly concerning their tendency to generate out-of-context responses. A key challenge is accurately detecting when LLMs stray from expected conversational norms, manifesting as topic shifts, factual inaccuracies, or outright hallucinations. Traditional anomaly detection struggles to directly apply within contextual semantics. This paper outlines our experiment in exploring the use of Representation Engineering (RepE) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to identify subspaces within the internal states of LLMs that represent a specific context. By training OCSVM on in-context examples, we establish a robust boundary within the LLM's hidden state latent space. We evaluate out study with two open source LLMs - Llama and Qwen models in specific contextual domain. Our approach entailed identifying the optimal layers within the LLM's internal state subspaces that strongly associates with the context of interest. Our evaluation results showed promising results in identifying the subspace for a specific context. Aside from being useful in detecting in or out of context conversation threads, this research work contributes to the study of better interpreting LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12286v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TimeGMM: Single-Pass Probabilistic Forecasting via Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models with Reversible Normalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12288</link><description>arXiv:2601.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic time series forecasting is crucial for quantifying future uncertainty, with significant applications in fields such as energy and finance. However, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive sampling or restrictive parametric assumptions to characterize future distributions, which limits predictive performance and introduces distributional mismatch. To address these challenges, this paper presents TimeGMM, a novel probabilistic forecasting framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) that captures complex future distributions in a single forward pass. A key component is GMM-adapted Reversible Instance Normalization (GRIN), a novel module designed to dynamically adapt to temporal-probabilistic distribution shifts. The framework integrates a dedicated Temporal Encoder (TE-Module) with a Conditional Temporal-Probabilistic Decoder (CTPD-Module) to jointly capture temporal dependencies and mixture distribution parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeGMM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving maximum improvements of 22.48\% in CRPS and 21.23\% in NMAE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12288v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ParaMETA: Towards Learning Disentangled Paralinguistic Speaking Styles Representations from Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12289</link><description>arXiv:2601.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning representative embeddings for different types of speaking styles, such as emotion, age, and gender, is critical for both recognition tasks (e.g., cognitive computing and human-computer interaction) and generative tasks (e.g., style-controllable speech generation). In this work, we introduce ParaMETA, a unified and flexible framework for learning and controlling speaking styles directly from speech. Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models. It supports both speech- and text-based prompting and allows users to modify one speaking styles while preserving others. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ParaMETA outperforms strong baselines in classification accuracy and generates more natural and expressive speech, while maintaining a lightweight and efficient model suitable for real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12289v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Re-educating Educated Ones: A Case Study on Chakma Language Revitalization in Chittagong Hill Tracts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12290</link><description>arXiv:2601.12290v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Scalable and maintainable map representations are fundamental to enabling large-scale visual navigation and facilitating the deployment of robots in real-world environments. While collaborative localization across multi-session mapping enhances efficiency, traditional structure-based methods struggle with high maintenance costs and fail in feature-less environments or under significant viewpoint changes typical of crowd-sourced data. To address this, we propose OPENNAVMAP, a lightweight, structure-free topometric system leveraging 3D geometric foundation models for on-demand reconstruction. Our method unifies dynamic programming-based sequence matching, geometric verification, and confidence-calibrated optimization to robust, coarse-to-fine submap alignment without requiring pre-built 3D models. Evaluations on the Map-Free benchmark demonstrate superior accuracy over structure-from-motion and regression baselines, achieving an average translation error of 0.62m. Furthermore, the system maintains global consistency across 15km of multi-session data with an absolute trajectory error below 3m for map merging. Finally, we validate practical utility through 12 successful autonomous image-goal navigation tasks on simulated and physical robots. Code and datasets will be publicly available in https://rpl-cs-ucl.github.io/OpenNavMap_page.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12291v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ToolPRMBench: Evaluating and Advancing Process Reward Models for Tool-using Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12294</link><description>arXiv:2601.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward-guided search methods have demonstrated strong potential in enhancing tool-using agents by effectively guiding sampling and exploration over complex action spaces. As a core design, those search methods utilize process reward models (PRMs) to provide step-level rewards, enabling more fine-grained monitoring. However, there is a lack of systematic and reliable evaluation benchmarks for PRMs in tool-using settings. In this paper, we introduce ToolPRMBench, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate PRMs for tool-using agents. ToolPRMBench is built on top of several representative tool-using benchmarks and converts agent trajectories into step-level test cases. Each case contains the interaction history, a correct action, a plausible but incorrect alternative, and relevant tool metadata. We respectively utilize offline sampling to isolate local single-step errors and online sampling to capture realistic multi-step failures from full agent rollouts. A multi-LLM verification pipeline is proposed to reduce label noise and ensure data quality. We conduct extensive experiments across large language models, general PRMs, and tool-specialized PRMs on ToolPRMBench. The results reveal clear differences in PRM effectiveness and highlight the potential of specialized PRMs for tool-using. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/David-Li0406/ToolPRMBench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12294v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CD-PIM: A High-Bandwidth and Compute-Efficient LPDDR5-Based PIM for Low-Batch LLM Acceleration on Edge-Device</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12298</link><description>arXiv:2601.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge deployment of low-batch large language models (LLMs) faces critical memory bandwidth bottlenecks when executing memory-intensive general matrix-vector multiplications (GEMV) operations. While digital processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures promise to accelerate GEMV operations, existing PIM-equipped edge devices still suffer from three key limitations: limited bandwidth improvement, component under-utilization in mixed workloads, and low compute capacity of computing units (CUs). In this paper, we propose CD-PIM to address these challenges through three key innovations. First, we introduce a high-bandwidth compute-efficient mode (HBCEM) that enhances bandwidth by dividing each bank into four pseudo-banks through segmented global bitlines. Second, we propose a low-batch interleaving mode (LBIM) to improve component utilization by overlapping GEMV operations with GEMM operations. Third, we design a compute-efficient CU that performs enhanced GEMV operations in a pipelined manner by serially feeding weight data into the computing core. Forth, we adopt a column-wise mapping for the key-cache matrix and row-wise mapping for the value-cache matrix, which fully utilizes CU resources. Our evaluation shows that compared to a GPU-only baseline and state-of-the-art PIM designs, our CD-PIM achieves 11.42x and 4.25x speedup on average within a single batch in HBCEM mode, respectively. Moreover, for low-batch sizes, the CD-PIM achieves an average speedup of 1.12x in LBIM compared to HBCEM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12298v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model with Text-Enhanced Pre-training for Sequential Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12301</link><description>arXiv:2601.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems excel at capturing users' dynamic preferences by leveraging their interaction histories. Most existing SR systems assign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, adopting various models to combine these embeddings into a sequence representation that captures user intent. However, we argue that this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's multi-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Furthermore, users often exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking both action and musical films within the genre facet), which are challenging to fully represent with static identifiers. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture titled Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the final multi-head attention layer to predict the next item separately, effectively capturing distinct item facets. A gating mechanism then integrates these predictions by dynamically determining their importance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network within each attention head to disentangle varied user preferences within each facet, utilizing a learnable router network to aggregate expert outputs based on context. Complementing this architecture, we design a Text-Enhanced Facet-Aware Pre-training module to overcome the limitations of randomly initialized embeddings. By utilizing a pre-trained text encoder and employing an alternating supervised contrastive learning objective, we explicitly disentangle facet-specific features from textual metadata (e.g., descriptions) before sequential training begins. This ensures that the item embeddings are semantically robust and aligned with the downstream multi-facet framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Minimum Length of Functional Batch Codes with Small Recovery Sets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12302</link><description>arXiv:2601.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch codes are of potential use for load balancing and private information retrieval in distributed data storage systems. Recently, a special case of batch codes, termed functional batch codes, was proposed in the literature. In functional batch codes, users can query linear combinations of the information symbols, and not only the information symbols themselves, as is the case for standard batch codes. In this work, we consider linear functional batch codes with the additional property that every query is answered by using only a small number of coded symbols. We derive bounds on the minimum length of such codes, and evaluate the results by numerical computations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Concepts from Representations: Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Models via Sparse Decomposition of Visual Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12303</link><description>arXiv:2601.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in image recognition, yet their inherent opacity poses challenges for deployment in critical domains. Concept-based interpretations aim to address this by explaining model reasoning through human-understandable concepts. However, existing post-hoc methods and ante-hoc concept bottleneck models (CBMs), suffer from limitations such as unreliable concept relevance, non-visual or labor-intensive concept definitions, and model or data-agnostic assumptions. This paper introduces Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Model via Representation Decomposition (PCBM-ReD), a novel pipeline that retrofits interpretability onto pretrained opaque models. PCBM-ReD automatically extracts visual concepts from a pre-trained encoder, employs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to label and filter concepts based on visual identifiability and task relevance, and selects an independent subset via reconstruction-guided optimization. Leveraging CLIP's visual-text alignment, it decomposes image representations into linear combination of concept embeddings to fit into the CBMs abstraction. Extensive experiments across 11 image classification tasks show PCBM-ReD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, narrows the performance gap with end-to-end models, and exhibits better interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12303v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Two-Stage Globally-Diverse Adversarial Attack for Vision-Language Pre-training Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12304</link><description>arXiv:2601.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, particularly in black-box scenarios. Existing multimodal attacks often suffer from limited perturbation diversity and unstable multi-stage pipelines. To address these challenges, we propose 2S-GDA, a two-stage globally-diverse attack framework. The proposed method first introduces textual perturbations through a globally-diverse strategy by combining candidate text expansion with globally-aware replacement. To enhance visual diversity, image-level perturbations are generated using multi-scale resizing and block-shuffle rotation. Extensive experiments on VLP models demonstrate that 2S-GDA consistently improves attack success rates over state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 11.17\% in black-box settings. Our framework is modular and can be easily combined with existing methods to further enhance adversarial transferability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12304v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) Dataset Generator Framework for IoT Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12305</link><description>arXiv:2601.12305v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show that workflows composed of multiple LLM agents with distinct roles, tools, and communication patterns can outperform single-LLM baselines on complex tasks. However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12307v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Multi-Scale Correlation Meta-Network for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12308</link><description>arXiv:2601.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning in remote sensing remains challenging due to three factors: the scarcity of labeled data, substantial domain shifts, and the multi-scale nature of geospatial objects. To address these issues, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Scale Correlation Meta-Network (AMC-MetaNet), a lightweight yet powerful framework with three key innovations: (i) correlation-guided feature pyramids for capturing scale-invariant patterns, (ii) an adaptive channel correlation module (ACCM) for learning dynamic cross-scale relationships, and (iii) correlation-guided meta-learning that leverages correlation patterns instead of conventional prototype averaging. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heavy pre-trained models or transformers, AMC-MetaNet is trained from scratch with only $\sim600K$ parameters, offering $20\times$ fewer parameters than ResNet-18 while maintaining high efficiency ($&lt;50$ms per image inference). AMC-MetaNet achieves up to 86.65\% accuracy in 5-way 5-shot classification on various remote sensing datasets, including EuroSAT, NWPU-RESISC45, UC Merced Land Use, and AID. Our results establish AMC-MetaNet as a computationally efficient, scale-aware framework for real-world few-shot remote sensing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12308v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Survival is the Only Reward: Sustainable Self-Training Through Environment-Mediated Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12310</link><description>arXiv:2601.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-training systems often degenerate due to the lack of an external criterion for judging data quality, leading to reward hacking and semantic drift. This paper provides a proof-of-concept system architecture for stable self-training under sparse external feedback and bounded memory, and empirically characterises its learning dynamics and failure modes.
  We introduce a self-training architecture in which learning is mediated exclusively by environmental viability, rather than by reward, objective functions, or externally defined fitness criteria. Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.
  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12310v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-reality Location Privacy Protection in 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses: An LLM-enhanced Hybrid Generative Diffusion Model-based Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12311</link><description>arXiv:2601.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses enables Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to operate across physical and virtual spaces through space-air-ground-sea integrated networks. The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CurConMix+: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Framework for Hierarchical Surgical Workflow Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12312</link><description>arXiv:2601.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical action triplet recognition aims to understand fine-grained surgical behaviors by modeling the interactions among instruments, actions, and anatomical targets. Despite its clinical importance for workflow analysis and skill assessment, progress has been hindered by severe class imbalance, subtle visual variations, and the semantic interdependence among triplet components. Existing approaches often address only a subset of these challenges rather than tackling them jointly, which limits their ability to form a holistic understanding. This study builds upon CurConMix, a spatial representation framework. At its core, a curriculum-guided contrastive learning strategy learns discriminative and progressively correlated features, further enhanced by structured hard-pair sampling and feature-level mixup. Its temporal extension, CurConMix+, integrates a Multi-Resolution Temporal Transformer (MRTT) that achieves robust, context-aware understanding by adaptively fusing multi-scale temporal features and dynamically balancing spatio-temporal cues. Furthermore, we introduce LLS48, a new, hierarchically annotated benchmark for complex laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, providing step-, task-, and action-level annotations. Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and LLS48 demonstrate that CurConMix+ not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in triplet recognition, but also exhibits strong cross-level generalization, as its fine-grained features effectively transfer to higher-level phase and step recognition tasks. Together, the framework and dataset provide a unified foundation for hierarchy-aware, reproducible, and interpretable surgical workflow understanding. The code and dataset will be publicly released on GitHub to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12312v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] S^2F-Net:A Robust Spatial-Spectral Fusion Framework for Cross-Model AIGC Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12313</link><description>arXiv:2601.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has imposed an urgent demand for detection schemes with strong generalization capabilities. However, existing detection methods generally suffer from overfitting to specific source models, leading to significant performance degradation when confronted with unseen generative architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cross-model detection framework called S 2 F-Net, whose core lies in exploring and leveraging the inherent spectral discrepancies between real and synthetic textures. Considering that upsampling operations leave unique and distinguishable frequency fingerprints in both texture-poor and texture-rich regions, we focus our research on the detection of frequency-domain artifacts, aiming to fundamentally improve the generalization performance of the model. Specifically, we introduce a learnable frequency attention module that adaptively weights and enhances discriminative frequency bands by synergizing spatial texture analysis and spectral dependencies.On the AIGCDetectBenchmark, which includes 17 categories of generative models, S 2 F-Net achieves a detection accuracy of 90.49%, significantly outperforming various existing baseline methods in cross-domain detection scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12313v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Similarity Network for Correlating Musical Structure to Military Strategy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12314</link><description>arXiv:2601.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music perception, a multi-sensory process based on the synesthesia effect, is an essential component of music aesthetic education. Understanding music structure helps both perception and aesthetic education. Music structure incorporates a range of information, the coordination of which forms the melody, just as different military actions cooperate to produce a military strategy. However, there are a few ways for assessing music perception from the perspectives of system operation and information management. In this paper, we explore the similarities between music structure and military strategy while creating the Music Clips Correlation Network (MCCN) based on Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). The inspiration comes from the comparison between a concert conductor's musical score and a military war commander's sand table exercise. Specifically, we create MCCNs for various kinds of war movie soundtracks, then relate military tactics (Sun Tzu's Art of War, etc.) and political institutions to military operations networks. Our primary findings suggest a few similarities, implying that music perception and aesthetic education can be approached from a military strategy and management perspective through this interdisciplinary research. Similarly, we can discover similarities between the art of military scheming and the art of musical structure based on network analysis in order to facilitate the understanding of the relationship between technology and art.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12314v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GazeFormer-MoE: Context-Aware Gaze Estimation via CLIP and MoE Transformer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12316</link><description>arXiv:2601.12316v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The advancement of Document Intelligence (DI) demands large-scale, high-quality training data, yet manual annotation remains a critical bottleneck. While data generation methods are evolving rapidly, existing surveys are constrained by fragmented focuses on single modalities or specific tasks, lacking a unified perspective aligned with real-world workflows. To fill this gap, this survey establishes the first comprehensive technical map for data generation in DI. Data generation is redefined as supervisory signal production, and a novel taxonomy is introduced based on the "availability of data and labels." This framework organizes methodologies into four resource-centric paradigms: Data Augmentation, Data Generation from Scratch, Automated Data Annotation, and Self-Supervised Signal Construction. Furthermore, a multi-level evaluation framework is established to integrate intrinsic quality and extrinsic utility, compiling performance gains across diverse DI benchmarks. Guided by this unified structure, the methodological landscape is dissected to reveal critical challenges such as fidelity gaps and frontiers including co-evolutionary ecosystems. Ultimately, by systematizing this fragmented field, data generation is positioned as the central engine for next-generation DI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12318v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ordered Local Momentum for Asynchronous Distributed Learning under Arbitrary Delays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12322</link><description>arXiv:2601.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum SGD (MSGD) serves as a foundational optimizer in training deep models due to momentum's key role in accelerating convergence and enhancing generalization. Meanwhile, asynchronous distributed learning is crucial for training large-scale deep models, especially when the computing capabilities of the workers in the cluster are heterogeneous. To reduce communication frequency, local updates are widely adopted in distributed learning. However, how to implement asynchronous distributed MSGD with local updates remains unexplored. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method, called \underline{or}dered \underline{lo}cal \underline{mo}mentum (OrLoMo), for asynchronous distributed learning. In OrLoMo, each worker runs MSGD locally. Then the local momentum from each worker will be aggregated by the server in order based on its global iteration index. To the best of our knowledge, OrLoMo is the first method to implement asynchronous distributed MSGD with local updates. We prove the convergence of OrLoMo for non-convex problems under arbitrary delays. Experiments validate that OrLoMo can outperform its synchronous counterpart and other asynchronous methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12322v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MARO: Learning Stronger Reasoning from Social Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12323</link><description>arXiv:2601.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans face countless scenarios that require reasoning and judgment in daily life. However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Experiencer, Helper, or Observer: Online Fraud Intervention for Older Adults Through Role-based Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12324</link><description>arXiv:2601.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online fraud is a critical global threat that disproportionately targets older adults. Prior anti-fraud education for older adults has largely relied on static, traditional instruction that limits engagement and real-world transfer, whereas role-based simulation offers realistic yet low-risk opportunities for practice. Moreover, most interventions situate learners as victims, overlooking that fraud encounters often involve multiple roles, such as bystanders who witness scams and helpers who support victims. To address this gap, we developed ROLESafe, an anti-fraud educational intervention in which older adults learn through different learning roles, including Experiencer (experiencing fraud), Helper (assisting a victim), and Observer (witnessing fraud). In a between-subjects study with 144 older adults in China, we found that the Experiencer and Helper roles significantly improved participants' ability to identify online fraud. These findings highlight the promise of role-based, multi-perspective simulations for enhancing fraud awareness among older adults and provide design implications for future anti-fraud education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Sensor Matching with HyperNetworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12325</link><description>arXiv:2601.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypernetworks are models that generate or modulate the weights of another network. They provide a flexible mechanism for injecting context and task conditioning and have proven broadly useful across diverse applications without significant increases in model size. We leverage hypernetworks to improve multimodal patch matching by introducing a lightweight descriptor-learning architecture that augments a Siamese CNN with (i) hypernetwork modules that compute adaptive, per-channel scaling and shifting and (ii) conditional instance normalization that provides modality-specific adaptation (e.g., visible vs. infrared, VIS-IR) in shallow layers. This combination preserves the efficiency of descriptor-based methods during inference while increasing robustness to appearance shifts. Trained with a triplet loss and hard-negative mining, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on VIS-NIR and other VIS-IR benchmarks and matches or surpasses prior methods on additional datasets, despite their higher inference cost. To spur progress on domain shift, we also release GAP-VIR, a cross-platform (ground/aerial) VIS-IR patch dataset with 500K pairs, enabling rigorous evaluation of cross-domain generalization and adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12325v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EmoKGEdit: Training-free Affective Injection via Visual Cue Transformation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12326</link><description>arXiv:2601.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing image emotion editing methods struggle to disentangle emotional cues from latent content representations, often yielding weak emotional expression and distorted visual structures. To bridge this gap, we propose EmoKGEdit, a novel training-free framework for precise and structure-preserving image emotion editing. Specifically, we construct a Multimodal Sentiment Association Knowledge Graph (MSA-KG) to disentangle the intricate relationships among objects, scenes, attributes, visual clues and emotion. MSA-KG explicitly encode the causal chain among object-attribute-emotion, and as external knowledge to support chain of thought reasoning, guiding the multimodal large model to infer plausible emotion-related visual cues and generate coherent instructions. In addition, based on MSA-KG, we design a disentangled structure-emotion editing module that explicitly separates emotional attributes from layout features within the latent space, which ensures that the target emotion is effectively injected while strictly maintaining visual spatial coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoKGEdit achieves excellent performance in both emotion fidelity and content preservation, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Expert Validation Framework (EVF): Enabling Domain Expert Control in AI Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12327</link><description>arXiv:2601.12327v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Intrinsic Image Decomposition (IID) separates an image into albedo and shading components. It is a core step in many real-world applications, such as relighting and material editing. Existing IID models achieve good results, but often use a large number of parameters. This makes them costly to combine with other models in real-world settings. To address this problem, we propose a flow matching-based solution. For this, we design a novel architecture, FlowIID, based on latent flow matching. FlowIID combines a VAE-guided latent space with a flow matching module, enabling a stable decomposition of albedo and shading. FlowIID is not only parameter-efficient, but also produces results in a single inference step. Despite its compact design, FlowIID delivers competitive and superior results compared to existing models across various benchmarks. This makes it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time vision applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IceWatch: Forecasting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) using Multimodal Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12330</link><description>arXiv:2601.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) pose a serious threat in high mountain regions. They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Privacy-Preserving Retrieval Augmented Generation with Distance-Preserving Encryption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12331</link><description>arXiv:2601.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAG has emerged as a key technique for enhancing response quality of LLMs without high computational cost. In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure cloud-augmented LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12331v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Worst-case Nonlinear Regression with Error Bounds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12334</link><description>arXiv:2601.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an active-learning approach to worst-case nonlinear regression with deterministic error guarantees. Given a known nonlinear function defined over a compact set, we compute a surrogate model, such as a feedforward neural network, by minimizing the maximum absolute approximation error. To address the nonsmooth nature of the resulting minimax problem, we introduce a smooth approximation of the $L_\infty$-type loss that enables efficient gradient-based training. We iteratively enrich the training set by actively learning points of largest approximation error through global optimization. The resulting models admit certified worst-case error bounds, either constant or input-dependent, over the entire input domain. The approach is demonstrated through approximations of nonlinear functions and nonconvex sets, as well as through the derivation of uncertain models of more complex nonlinear dynamics within a given model class, and the approximation of explicit model predictive control laws.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Turbo-GoDec: Exploiting the Cluster Sparsity Prior for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12337</link><description>arXiv:2601.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a key task in hyperspectral image processing, hyperspectral anomaly detection has garnered significant attention and undergone extensive research. Existing methods primarily relt on two prior assumption: low-rank background and sparse anomaly, along with additional spatial assumptions of the background. However, most methods only utilize the sparsity prior assumption for anomalies and rarely expand on this hypothesis. From observations of hyperspectral images, we find that anomalous pixels exhibit certain spatial distribution characteristics: they often manifest as small, clustered groups in space, which we refer to as cluster sparsity of anomalies. Then, we combined the cluster sparsity prior with the classical GoDec algorithm, incorporating the cluster sparsity prior into the S-step of GoDec. This resulted in a new hyperspectral anomaly detection method, which we called Turbo-GoDec. In this approach, we modeled the cluster sparsity prior of anomalies using a Markov random field and computed the marginal probabilities of anomalies through message passing on a factor graph. Locations with high anomalous probabilities were treated as the sparse component in the Turbo-GoDec. Experiments are conducted on three real hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets which demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Turbo-GoDec method in detecting small-size anomalies comparing with the vanilla GoDec (LSMAD) and state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. The code is available at https://github.com/jiahuisheng/Turbo-GoDec.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12337v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Actionable Advice from Reviews via Mixture of LoRA Experts: A Two-LLM Pipeline for Issue Extraction and Business Recommendations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12338</link><description>arXiv:2601.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customer reviews contain detailed, domain specific signals about service failures and user expectations, but converting this unstructured feedback into actionable business decisions remains difficult. We study review-to-action generation: producing concrete, implementable recommendations grounded in review text. We propose a modular two-LLM framework in which an Issue model extracts salient issues and assigns coarse themes, and an Advice model generates targeted operational fixes conditioned on the extracted issue representation. To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity. Across both domains, our approach consistently outperforms prompting-only and single-adapter baselines, yielding higher actionability and specificity while retaining favorable efficiency-quality trade-offs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12338v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Time-Continuous Modeling for Temporal Affective Pattern Recognition in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12341</link><description>arXiv:2601.12341v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) generate citation-rich reports via multi-step search and synthesis, yet existing benchmarks mainly target text-only settings or short-form multimodal QA, missing end-to-end multimodal evidence use. We introduce MMDeepResearch-Bench (MMDR-Bench), a benchmark of 140 expert-crafted tasks across 21 domains, where each task provides an image-text bundle to evaluate multimodal understanding and citation-grounded report generation. Compared to prior setups, MMDR-Bench emphasizes report-style synthesis with explicit evidence use, where models must connect visual artifacts to sourced claims and maintain consistency across narrative, citations, and visual references. We further propose a unified, interpretable evaluation pipeline: Formula-LLM Adaptive Evaluation (FLAE) for report quality, Trustworthy Retrieval-Aligned Citation Evaluation (TRACE) for citation-grounded evidence alignment, and Multimodal Support-Aligned Integrity Check (MOSAIC) for text-visual integrity, each producing fine-grained signals that support error diagnosis beyond a single overall score. Experiments across 25 state-of-the-art models reveal systematic trade-offs between generation quality, citation discipline, and multimodal grounding, highlighting that strong prose alone does not guarantee faithful evidence use and that multimodal integrity remains a key bottleneck for deep research agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RIPPLE++: An Incremental Framework for Efficient GNN Inference on Evolving Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12347</link><description>arXiv:2601.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world graphs are dynamic, with frequent updates to their structure and features due to evolving vertex and edge properties. These continual changes pose significant challenges for efficient inference in graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing vertex-wise and layer-wise inference approaches are ill-suited for dynamic graphs, as they incur redundant computations, large neighborhood traversals, and high communication costs, especially in distributed settings. Additionally, while sampling-based approaches can be adopted to approximate final layer embeddings, these are often not preferred in critical applications due to their non-determinism. These limitations hinder low-latency inference required in real-time applications. To address this, we propose RIPPLE++, a framework for streaming GNN inference that efficiently and accurately updates embeddings in response to changes in the graph structure or features. RIPPLE++ introduces a generalized incremental programming model that captures the semantics of GNN aggregation functions and incrementally propagates updates to affected neighborhoods. RIPPLE++ accommodates all common graph updates, including vertex/edge addition/deletions and vertex feature updates. RIPPLE++ supports both single-machine and distributed deployments. On a single machine, it achieves up to $56$K updates/sec on sparse graphs like Arxiv ($169$K vertices, $1.2$M edges), and about $7.6$K updates/sec on denser graphs like Products ($2.5$M vertices, $123.7$M edges), with latencies of $0.06$--$960$ms, and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by $2.2$--$24\times$ on throughput. In distributed settings, RIPPLE++ offers up to $\approx25\times$ higher throughput and $20\times$ lower communication costs compared to recomputing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12347v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative AI Agents for Controllable and Protected Content Creation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12348</link><description>arXiv:2601.12348v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large multimodal model powered GUI agents are emerging as high-privilege operators on mobile platforms, entrusted with perceiving screen content and injecting inputs. However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.
  We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.
  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal). Our findings reveal a fundamental architectural flaw in current agent-OS integration and provide critical insights for the secure design of future agent systems.

Abstract: The Coupon Collector Problem (CCP) is a well-known combinatorial problem that seeks to estimate the number of random draws required to complete a collection of $n$ distinct coupon types. Various generalizations of this problem have been applied in numerous engineering domains. However, practical applications are often hindered by the computational challenges associated with deriving numerical results for moments and distributions. In this work, we present three algorithms for solving the most general form of the CCP, where coupons are collected under any arbitrary drawing probability, with the objective of obtaining $t$ copies of a subset of $k$ coupons from a total of $n$. The First algorithm provides the base model to compute the expectation, variance, and the second moment of the collection process. The second algorithm utilizes the construction of the base model and computes the same values in polynomial time with respect to $n$ under the uniform drawing distribution, and the third algorithm extends to any general drawing distribution. All algorithms leverage Markov models specifically designed to address computational challenges, ensuring exact computation of the expectation and variance of the collection process. Their implementation uses a dynamic programming approach that follows from the Markov models framework, and their time complexity is analyzed accordingly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12351v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Shallow Waters to Mariana Trench: A Survey of Bio-inspired Underwater Soft Robots</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12353</link><description>arXiv:2601.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample Exploring the ocean environment holds profound significance in areas such as resource exploration and ecological protection. Underwater robots struggle with extreme water pressure and often cause noise and damage to the underwater ecosystem, while bio-inspired soft robots draw inspiration from aquatic creatures to address these challenges. These bio-inspired approaches enable robots to withstand high water pressure, minimize drag, operate with efficient manipulation and sensing systems, and interact with the environment in an eco-friendly manner. Consequently, bio-inspired soft robots have emerged as a promising field for ocean exploration. This paper reviews recent advancements in underwater bio-inspired soft robots, analyses their design considerations when facing different desired functions, bio-inspirations, ambient pressure, temperature, light, and biodiversity , and finally explores the progression from bio-inspired principles to practical applications in the field and suggests potential directions for developing the next generation of underwater soft robots.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12353v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LB-MCTS: Synergizing Large Language Models and Bayesian Optimization for Efficient CASH</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12355</link><description>arXiv:2601.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To lower the expertise barrier in machine learning, the AutoML community has focused on the CASH problem, a fundamental challenge that automates the process of algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning. While traditional methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO) struggle with cold-start issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) can mitigate these via semantic priors. However, existing LLM-based optimizers generalize poorly to the high-dimensional, structured CASH space. We propose LB-MCTS, a framework synergizing LLMs and BO within a Monte Carlo Tree Search structure. It maximizes LLM reasoning with Selective Tuning Memory (STM) and explicit exploration-exploitation trade-off. It combines the strengths of both paradigms by dynamically shifting from LLM-driven to BO-driven proposals as data accumulates. Experiments on 104 AMLB datasets demonstrate the superiority of LB-MCTS over the competitive baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SimpleMatch: A Simple and Strong Baseline for Semantic Correspondence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12357</link><description>arXiv:2601.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in semantic correspondence have been largely driven by the use of pre-trained large-scale models. However, a limitation of these approaches is their dependence on high-resolution input images to achieve optimal performance, which results in considerable computational overhead. In this work, we address a fundamental limitation in current methods: the irreversible fusion of adjacent keypoint features caused by deep downsampling operations. This issue is triggered when semantically distinct keypoints fall within the same downsampled receptive field (e.g., 16x16 patches). To address this issue, we present SimpleMatch, a simple yet effective framework for semantic correspondence that delivers strong performance even at low resolutions. We propose a lightweight upsample decoder that progressively recovers spatial detail by upsampling deep features to 1/4 resolution, and a multi-scale supervised loss that ensures the upsampled features retain discriminative features across different spatial scales. In addition, we introduce sparse matching and window-based localization to optimize training memory usage and reduce it by 51%. At a resolution of 252x252 (3.3x smaller than current SOTA methods), SimpleMatch achieves superior performance with 84.1% PCK@0.1 on the SPair-71k benchmark. We believe this framework provides a practical and efficient baseline for future research in semantic correspondence.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require adaptive behavior planners to navigate unpredictable, real-world environments safely.

This paper presents an agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal vision models (LVMs) to generate and adapt BTs on the fly. A specialized Descriptor agent applies chain-of-symbols prompting to assess scene criticality, a Planner agent constructs high-level sub-goals via in-context learning, and a Generator agent synthesizes executable BT sub-trees in XML format. Integrated into a CARLA+Nav2 simulation, our system triggers only upon baseline BT failure, demonstrating successful navigation around unexpected obstacles (e.g., street blockage) with no human intervention.

Despite advances in alignment, even state-of-the-art LLMs remain broadly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, underscoring the urgent need for robust, productive, and generalizable detection mechanisms beyond inefficient, model-specific patches. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection (ZEDD), a lightweight, low-engineering-overhead framework that identifies both direct and indirect prompt injection attempts by quantifying semantic shifts in embedding space between benign and suspect inputs. ZEDD operates without requiring access to model internals, prior knowledge of attack types, or task-specific retraining, enabling efficient zero-shot deployment across diverse LLM architectures. Our method uses adversarial-clean prompt pairs and measures embedding drift via cosine similarity to capture subtle adversarial manipulations inherent to real-world injection attacks. To ensure robust evaluation, we assemble and re-annotate the comprehensive LLMail-Inject dataset spanning five injection categories derived from publicly available sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that embedding drift is a robust and transferable signal, outperforming traditional methods in detection accuracy and operational efficiency. With greater than 93% accuracy in classifying prompt injections across model architectures like Llama 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral and a false positive rate of &lt;3%, our approach offers a lightweight, scalable defense layer that integrates into existing LLM pipelines, addressing a critical gap in securing LLM-powered systems to withstand adaptive adversarial threats.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discovering 100+ Compiler Defects in 72 Hours via LLM-Driven Semantic Logic Recomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12360</link><description>arXiv:2601.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compilers constitute the foundational root-of-trust in software supply chains; however, their immense complexity inevitably conceals critical defects. Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.
  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.
  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer. Furthermore, through a 72-hour fuzzing campaign, FeatureFuzz identified 106 bugs in GCC and LLVM, 76 of which have already been confirmed by compiler developers, validating the approach's ability to stress-test modern compilers effectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12360v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Complexity of Model Checking Second-Order Hyperproperties on Finite Structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12361</link><description>arXiv:2601.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the model checking problem of Hyper2LTL over finite structures. Hyper2LTL is a second-order hyperlogic, that extends the well-studied logic HyperLTL by adding quantification over sets of traces, to express complex hyperproperties such as epistemic and asynchronous hyperproperties. While Hyper2LTL is very expressive, its expressiveness comes with a price, and its general model checking problem is undecidable. This motivates us to study the model checking problem for Hyper2LTL over finite structures -- tree-shaped or acyclic graphs, which are particularly useful for monitoring purposes. We show that Hyper2LTL model checking is decidable on finite structures. It is in PSPACE (in the size of the model) on tree-shaped models and in EXPSPACE on acyclic models. Additionally, we show that for an expressive fragment of Hyper2LTL, namely the Fixpoint Hyper2LTLfp fragment, the model checking problem is much simpler and is P-complete on tree-shaped models and EXP-complete on acyclic models. Last, we present some preliminary results that take into account not only the size of the model, but also the formula size.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12361v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning-Based Framework for Real Time Detection and Early Prediction of Control Valve Stiction in Industrial Control Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12362</link><description>arXiv:2601.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control valve stiction, a friction that prevents smooth valve movement, is a common fault in industrial process systems that causes instability, equipment wear, and higher maintenance costs. Many plants still operate with conventional valves that lack real time monitoring, making early predictions challenging. This study presents a machine learning (ML) framework for detecting and predicting stiction using only routinely collected process signals: the controller output (OP) from control systems and the process variable (PV), such as flow rate. Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset. The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and was able to predict stiction up to four hours in advance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ML based early prediction of control valve stiction from real industry data. The proposed framework can be integrated into existing control systems to support predictive maintenance, reduce downtime, and avoid unnecessary hardware replacement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12362v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DepthCropSeg++: Scaling a Crop Segmentation Foundation Model With Depth-Labeled Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12366</link><description>arXiv:2601.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DepthCropSeg++: a foundation model for crop segmentation, capable of segmenting different crop species under open in-field environment. Crop segmentation is a fundamental task for modern agriculture, which closely relates to many downstream tasks such as plant phenotyping, density estimation, and weed control. In the era of foundation models, a number of generic large language and vision models have been developed. These models have demonstrated remarkable real world generalization due to significant model capacity and largescale datasets. However, current crop segmentation models mostly learn from limited data due to expensive pixel-level labelling cost, often performing well only under specific crop types or controlled environment. In this work, we follow the vein of our previous work DepthCropSeg, an almost unsupervised approach to crop segmentation, to scale up a cross-species and crossscene crop segmentation dataset, with 28,406 images across 30+ species and 15 environmental conditions. We also build upon a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architecture ViT-Adapter architecture, enhance it with dynamic upsampling for improved detail awareness, and train the model with a two-stage selftraining pipeline. To systematically validate model performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments to justify the effectiveness and generalization capabilities across multiple crop datasets. Results demonstrate that DepthCropSeg++ achieves 93.11% mIoU on a comprehensive testing set, outperforming both supervised baselines and general-purpose vision foundation models like Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) by significant margins (+0.36% and +48.57% respectively). The model particularly excels in challenging scenarios including night-time environment (86.90% mIoU), high-density canopies (90.09% mIoU), and unseen crop varieties (90.09% mIoU), indicating a new state of the art for crop segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12366v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] User-to-Vehicle Interaction in Smart Mobility: The GO-DRiVeS Autonomous Ride-Sharing Application</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12367</link><description>arXiv:2601.12367v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are increasingly used for automated survey generation. However, whether they can write surveys like human experts remains unclear. Existing benchmarks focus on fluency or citation accuracy, but none evaluates the core capabilities: retrieving essential papers and organizing them into coherent knowledge structures. We introduce TaxoBench, a diagnostic benchmark derived from 72 highly-cited computer science surveys. We manually extract expert-authored taxonomy trees containing 3,815 precisely categorized citations as ground truth. Our benchmark supports two evaluation modes: Deep Research mode tests end-to-end retrieval and organization given only a topic, while Bottom-Up mode isolates structuring capability by providing the exact papers human experts used. We evaluate 7 leading Deep Research agents and 12 frontier LLMs. Results reveal a dual bottleneck: the best agent recalls only 20.9% of expert-selected papers, and even with perfect input, the best model achieves only 0.31 ARI in organization. Current deep research agents remain far from expert-level survey writing. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/KongLongGeFDU/TaxoBench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12369v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CD-TWINSAFE: A ROS-enabled Digital Twin for Scene Understanding and Safety Emerging V2I Technology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12373</link><description>arXiv:2601.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the CD-TWINSAFE is introduced, a V2I-based digital twin for Autonomous Vehicles. The proposed architecture is composed of two stacks running simultaneously, an on-board driving stack that includes a stereo camera for scene understanding, and a digital twin stack that runs an Unreal Engine 5 replica of the scene viewed by the camera as well as returning safety alerts to the cockpit. The on-board stack is implemented on the vehicle side including 2 main autonomous modules; localization and perception. The position and orientation of the ego vehicle are obtained using on-board sensors. Furthermore, the perception module is responsible for processing 20-fps images from stereo camera and understands the scene through two complementary pipelines. The pipeline are working on object detection and feature extraction including object velocity, yaw and the safety metrics time-to-collision and time-headway. The collected data form the driving stack are sent to the infrastructure side through the ROS-enabled architecture in the form of custom ROS2 messages and sent over UDP links that ride a 4G modem for V2I communication. The environment is monitored via the digital twin through the shared messages which update the information of the spawned ego vehicle and detected objects based on the real-time localization and perception data. Several tests with different driving scenarios to confirm the validity and real-time response of the proposed architecture.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12373v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Scalable Entity-Based Framework for Auditing Bias in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12374</link><description>arXiv:2601.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches to bias evaluation in large language models (LLMs) trade ecological validity for statistical control, relying on artificial prompts that poorly reflect real-world use, or on naturalistic tasks that lack scale and rigor. We introduce a scalable bias-auditing framework using named entities as probes to measure structural disparities in model behavior. We show that synthetic data reliably reproduces bias patterns observed in natural text, enabling large-scale analysis. Using this approach, we conduct the largest bias audit to date, comprising 1.9 billion data points across multiple entity types, tasks, languages, models, and prompting strategies. Our results reveal systematic biases: models penalize right-wing politicians, favor left-wing politicians, prefer Western and wealthy nations over the Global South, favor Western companies, and penalize firms in the defense and pharmaceutical sectors. While instruction tuning reduces bias, increasing model scale amplifies it, and prompting in Chinese or Russian does not attenuate Western-aligned preferences. These results indicate that LLMs should undergo rigorous auditing before deployment in high-stakes applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12374v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LiQSS: Post-Transformer Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space Tensor Networks for Real-Time 6G</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12375</link><description>arXiv:2601.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proactive and agentic control in Sixth-Generation (6G) Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) requires control-grade prediction under stringent Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) latency and computational constraints. While Transformer-based models are effective for sequence modeling, their quadratic complexity limits scalability in Near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) analytics. This paper investigates a post-Transformer design paradigm for efficient radio telemetry forecasting. We propose a quantum-inspired many-body state-space tensor network that replaces self-attention with stable structured state-space dynamics kernels, enabling linear-time sequence modeling. Tensor-network factorizations in the form of Tensor Train (TT) / Matrix Product State (MPS) representations are employed to reduce parameterization and data movement in both input projections and prediction heads, while lightweight channel gating and mixing layers capture non-stationary cross-Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dependencies. The proposed model is instantiated as an agentic perceive-predict xApp and evaluated on a bespoke O-RAN KPI time-series dataset comprising 59,441 sliding windows across 13 KPIs, using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) forecasting as a representative use case. Our proposed Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space (LiQSS) model is 10.8x-15.8x smaller and approximately 1.4x faster than prior structured state-space baselines. Relative to Transformer-based models, LiQSS achieves up to a 155x reduction in parameter count and up to 2.74x faster inference, without sacrificing forecasting accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12375v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LR-DWM: Efficient Watermarking for Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12376</link><description>arXiv:2601.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking (WM) is a critical mechanism for detecting and attributing AI-generated content. Current WM methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly tailored for autoregressive (AR) models: They rely on tokens being generated sequentially, and embed stable signals within the generated sequence based on the previously sampled text. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) generate text via non-sequential iterative denoising, which requires significant modification to use WM methods designed for AR models. Recent work proposed to watermark DLMs by inverting the process when needed, but suffers significant computational or memory overhead. We introduce Left-Right Diffusion Watermarking (LR-DWM), a scheme that biases the generated token based on both left and right neighbors, when they are available. LR-DWM incurs minimal runtime and memory overhead, remaining close to the non-watermarked baseline DLM while enabling reliable statistical detection under standard evaluation settings. Our results demonstrate that DLMs can be watermarked efficiently, achieving high detectability with negligible computational and memory overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12376v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] R-VoxelMap: Accurate Voxel Mapping with Recursive Plane Fitting for Online LiDAR Odometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12377</link><description>arXiv:2601.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes R-VoxelMap, a novel voxel mapping method that constructs accurate voxel maps using a geometry-driven recursive plane fitting strategy to enhance the localization accuracy of online LiDAR odometry. VoxelMap and its variants typically fit and check planes using all points in a voxel, which may lead to plane parameter deviation caused by outliers, over segmentation of large planes, and incorrect merging across different physical planes. To address these issues, R-VoxelMap utilizes a geometry-driven recursive construction strategy based on an outlier detect-and-reuse pipeline. Specifically, for each voxel, accurate planes are first fitted while separating outliers using random sample consensus (RANSAC). The remaining outliers are then propagated to deeper octree levels for recursive processing, ensuring a detailed representation of the environment. In addition, a point distribution-based validity check algorithm is devised to prevent erroneous plane merging. Extensive experiments on diverse open-source LiDAR(-inertial) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) datasets validate that our method achieves higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art approaches, with comparable efficiency and memory usage.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are a type of image that contains abundant spectral information. As a type of real-world data, the high-dimensional spectra in hyperspectral images are actually determined by only a few factors, such as chemical composition and illumination. Thus, spectra in hyperspectral images are highly likely to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. Based on the hyperspectral manifold hypothesis, we propose a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method (named ScoreAD) that leverages the time-dependent gradient field of the data distribution (i.e., the score), as learned by a score-based generative model (SGM). Our method first trains the SGM on the entire set of spectra from the hyperspectral image. At test time, each spectrum is passed through a perturbation kernel, and the resulting perturbed spectrum is fed into the trained SGM to obtain the estimated score. The manifold hypothesis of HSIs posits that background spectra reside on one or more low-dimensional manifolds. Conversely, anomalous spectra, owing to their unique spectral signatures, are considered outliers that do not conform to the background manifold. Based on this fundamental discrepancy in their manifold distributions, we leverage a generative SGM to achieve hyperspectral anomaly detection. Experiments on the four hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/jiahuisheng/ScoreAD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12379v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Statistical-Neural Interaction Networks for Interpretable Mixed-Type Data Imputation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12380</link><description>arXiv:2601.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world tabular databases routinely combine continuous measurements and categorical records, yet missing entries are pervasive and can distort downstream analysis. We propose Statistical-Neural Interaction (SNI), an interpretable mixed-type imputation framework that couples correlation-derived statistical priors with neural feature attention through a Controllable-Prior Feature Attention (CPFA) module. CPFA learns head-wise prior-strength coefficients $\{\lambda_h\}$ that softly regularize attention toward the prior while allowing data-driven deviations when nonlinear patterns appear to be present in the data. Beyond imputation, SNI aggregates attention maps into a directed feature-dependency matrix that summarizes which variables the imputer relied on, without requiring post-hoc explainers. We evaluate SNI against six baselines (Mean/Mode, MICE, KNN, MissForest, GAIN, MIWAE) on six datasets spanning ICU monitoring, population surveys, socio-economic statistics, and engineering applications. Under MCAR/strict-MAR at 30\% missingness, SNI is generally competitive on continuous metrics but is often outperformed by accuracy-first baselines (MissForest, MIWAE) on categorical variables; in return, it provides intrinsic dependency diagnostics and explicit statistical-neural trade-off parameters. We additionally report MNAR stress tests (with a mask-aware variant) and discuss computational cost, limitations -- particularly for severely imbalanced categorical targets -- and deployment scenarios where interpretability may justify the trade-off.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12380v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Hierarchical Benchmark of Foundation Models for Dermatology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12382</link><description>arXiv:2601.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have transformed medical image analysis by providing robust feature representations that reduce the need for large-scale task-specific training. However, current benchmarks in dermatology often reduce the complex diagnostic taxonomy to flat, binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi. This oversimplification obscures a model's ability to perform fine-grained differential diagnoses, which is critical for clinical workflow integration. This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from ten foundation models, spanning general computer vision, general medical imaging, and dermatology-specific domains, for hierarchical skin lesion classification. Using the DERM12345 dataset, which comprises 40 lesion subclasses, we calculated frozen embeddings and trained lightweight adapter models using a five-fold cross-validation. We introduce a hierarchical evaluation framework that assesses performance across four levels of clinical granularity: 40 Subclasses, 15 Main Classes, 2 and 4 Superclasses, and Binary Malignancy. Our results reveal a "granularity gap" in model capabilities: MedImageInsights achieved the strongest overall performance (97.52% weighted F1-Score on Binary Malignancy detection) but declined to 65.50% on fine-grained 40-class subtype classification. Conversely, MedSigLip (69.79%) and dermatology-specific models (Derm Foundation and MONET) excelled at fine-grained 40-class subtype discrimination while achieving lower overall performance than MedImageInsights on broader classification tasks. Our findings suggest that while general medical foundation models are highly effective for high-level screening, specialized modeling strategies are necessary for the granular distinctions required in diagnostic support systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12382v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context-Free Grammar Inference for Complex Programming Languages in Black Box Settings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12385</link><description>arXiv:2601.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grammar inference for complex programming languages remains a significant challenge, as existing approaches fail to scale to real world datasets within practical time constraints. In our experiments, none of the state-of-the-art tools, including Arvada, Treevada and Kedavra were able to infer grammars for complex languages such as C, C++, and Java within 48 hours. Arvada and Treevada perform grammar inference directly on full-length input examples, which proves inefficient for large files commonly found in such languages. While Kedavra introduces data decomposition to create shorter examples for grammar inference, its lexical analysis still relies on the original inputs. Additionally, its strict no-overgeneralization constraint limits the construction of complex grammars.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Crucio, which builds a decomposition forest to extract short examples for lexical and grammar inference via a distributional matrix. Experimental results show that Crucio is the only method capable of successfully inferring grammars for complex programming languages (where the number of nonterminals is up to 23x greater than in prior benchmarks) within reasonable time limits. On the prior simple benchmark, Crucio achieves an average recall improvement of 1.37x and 1.19x over Treevada and Kedavra, respectively, and improves F1 scores by 1.21x and 1.13x.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12385v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NADIR: Differential Attention Flow for Non-Autoregressive Transliteration in Indic Languages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12389</link><description>arXiv:2601.12389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we argue that not all sequence-to-sequence tasks require the strong inductive biases of autoregressive (AR) models. Tasks like multilingual transliteration, code refactoring, grammatical correction or text normalization often rely on local dependencies where the full modeling capacity of AR models can be overkill, creating a trade-off between their high accuracy and high inference latency. While non-autoregressive (NAR) models offer speed, they typically suffer from hallucinations and poor length control. To explore this trade-off, we focus on the multilingual transliteration task in Indic languages and introduce NADIR, a novel NAR architecture designed to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. NADIR integrates a Differential Transformer and a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism, enabling it to robustly model complex character mappings without sequential dependencies. NADIR achieves over a 13x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art AR baseline. It maintains a competitive mean Character Error Rate of 15.78%, compared to 14.44% for the AR model and 21.88% for a standard NAR equivalent. Importantly, NADIR reduces Repetition errors by 49.53%, Substitution errors by 24.45%, Omission errors by 32.92%, and Insertion errors by 16.87%. This work provides a practical blueprint for building fast and reliable NAR systems, effectively bridging the gap between AR accuracy and the demands of real-time, large-scale deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Auditing Meta and TikTok Research API Data Access under Article 40(12) of the Digital Services Act</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12390</link><description>arXiv:2601.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Article 40(12) of the Digital Services Act (DSA) requires Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) to provide vetted researchers with access to publicly accessible data. While prior work has identified shortcomings of platform-provided data access mechanisms, existing research has not quantitatively assessed data quality and completeness in Research APIs across platforms, nor systematically mapped how current access provisions fall short. This paper presents a systematic audit of research access modalities by comparing data obtained through platform Research APIs with data collected about the same platforms' user-visible public information environment (PIE). Focusing on two major platform APIs, the TikTok Research API and the Meta Content Library, we reconstruct full information feeds for two controlled sockpuppet accounts during two election periods and benchmark these against the data retrievable for the same posts through the corresponding Research APIs. Our findings show systematic data loss through three classes of platform-imposed mechanisms: scope narrowing, metadata stripping, and operational restrictions. Together, these mechanisms implement overlapping filters that exclude large portions of the platform PIE (up to approximately 50 percent), strip essential contextual metadata (up to approximately 83 percent), and impose severe technical constraints for researchers (down to approximately 1000 requests per day). Viewed through a data quality lens, these filters primarily undermine completeness, resulting in a structurally biased representation of platform activity. We conclude that, in their current form, the Meta and TikTok Research APIs fall short of supporting meaningful, independent auditing of systemic risks as envisioned under the DSA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Class-Partitioned VQ-VAE and Latent Flow Matching for Point Cloud Scene Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12391</link><description>arXiv:2601.12391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most 3D scene generation methods are limited to only generating object bounding box parameters while newer diffusion methods also generate class labels and latent features. Using object size or latent feature, they then retrieve objects from a predefined database. For complex scenes of varied, multi-categorical objects, diffusion-based latents cannot be effectively decoded by current autoencoders into the correct point cloud objects which agree with target classes. We introduce a Class-Partitioned Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CPVQ-VAE) that is trained to effectively decode object latent features, by employing a pioneering $\textit{class-partitioned codebook}$ where codevectors are labeled by class. To address the problem of $\textit{codebook collapse}$, we propose a $\textit{class-aware}$ running average update which reinitializes dead codevectors within each partition. During inference, object features and class labels, both generated by a Latent-space Flow Matching Model (LFMM) designed specifically for scene generation, are consumed by the CPVQ-VAE. The CPVQ-VAE's class-aware inverse look-up then maps generated latents to codebook entries that are decoded to class-specific point cloud shapes. Thereby, we achieve pure point cloud generation without relying on an external objects database for retrieval. Extensive experiments reveal that our method reliably recovers plausible point cloud scenes, with up to 70.4% and 72.3% reduction in Chamfer and Point2Mesh errors on complex living room scenes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12391v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Psych\=eChat: An Empathic Framework Focused on Emotion Shift Tracking and Safety Risk Analysis in Psychological Counseling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12392</link><description>arXiv:2601.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable advancements in psychological counseling. However, existing models generally do not explicitly model seekers' emotion shifts across counseling sessions, a core focus in classical psychological schools. Moreover, how to align counselor models' responses with these emotion shifts while proactively mitigating safety risks remains underexplored. To bridge these gaps, we propose Psych\=eChat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that Psych\=eChat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12392v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $2$-quasi-perfect Lee codes and abelian Ramanujan graphs: a new construction and relationship</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12393</link><description>arXiv:2601.12393v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Two physical-layer mechanisms for achieving user-side differential privacy in communication systems are proposed. Focusing on binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, differential privacy (DP) is first studied under a deterministic phase rotation applied on the BPSK modulation at the transmitter, while the receiver is assumed to be unaware of the rotation angle. In this setting, privacy is achieved through an effective reduction in the decision distance, resulting in a controlled increase in the bit error rate (BER) without explicit noise injection. Next, a BPSK transmission scheme with intentionally induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) is studied, where the receiver is likewise unaware of the deterministic timing offset that generates the ISI. Unlike the rotated BPSK scheme, the DP obtained via ISI is shown to depend explicitly on the input data distribution. In particular, numerical results demonstrate that, for a fixed ISI parameter, the privacy loss is maximized when the binary input symbols are equiprobable. While conventional DP mechanisms rely on artificially added noise, often incurring additional energy or communication costs, it is shown that structured modifications, such as modulation rotation or induced ISI inherent to realistic communication channels can itself provide DP guarantees. While the analysis focuses on deterministic transmitter modifications unknown to the receiver, it is noted that real-world devices naturally introduce unintentional rotations or ISI due to hardware nonidealities and implementation errors. These effects can therefore provide a level of privacy without requiring explicit noise injection. Hence, it is possible to avoid deliberately perturbing the data, instead leveraging inherent device imperfections to achieve privacy guarantees with no additional privacy cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12394v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VR$^2$: A Co-Located Dual-Headset Platform for Touch-Enabled Human-Robot Interaction Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12395</link><description>arXiv:2601.12395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Touch-rich human-robot interaction (HRI) is difficult to study: building and programming physical robots is costly and slow, while VR-based robot prototypes often remove physical contact or break the tight coupling between an agent's body and the user's felt touch. We present VR2VR, a co-located dual VR-headset platform for HRI research in which a participant and a hidden operator share the same physical space while experiencing different virtual embodiments. The participant sees an expressive virtual robot that interacts face-to-face in a shared virtual environment. In real time, the robot's upper-body gestures, head and gaze behaviors, and facial expressions are mapped from the operator's tracked motion and face signals. Because the operator is physically co-present and calibrated into the same coordinate frame, the operator can also physically touch the participant, enabling the participant to perceive robot touch aligned with the robot's hands; finger and hand motion are mapped to the robot using inverse kinematics to support precise contact. Beyond faithful motion retargeting for limb teleoperation, our VR2VR system supports experimental control by retargeting or selectively enabling nonverbal channels (e.g., head only vs. head+eyes vs. head+eyes+facial expressions) while keeping physical interaction constant. We detail the system design, calibration workflow, and safety considerations, and demonstrate the platform through a touch-based Wizard-of-Oz HRI study, illustrating how VR2VR lowers barriers for rapidly prototyping and rigorously evaluating embodied, touch-centric robot behaviors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12395v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Diverse Skills for Behavior Models with Mixture of Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12397</link><description>arXiv:2601.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning has demonstrated strong performance in robotic manipulation by learning from large-scale human demonstrations. While existing models excel at single-task learning, it is observed in practical applications that their performance degrades in the multi-task setting, where interference across tasks leads to an averaging effect. To address this issue, we propose to learn diverse skills for behavior models with Mixture of Experts, referred to as Di-BM. Di-BM associates each expert with a distinct observation distribution, enabling experts to specialize in sub-regions of the observation space. Specifically, we employ energy-based models to represent expert-specific observation distributions and jointly train them alongside the corresponding action models. Our approach is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into standard imitation learning methods. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Di-BM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, fine-tuning the pretrained Di-BM on novel tasks exhibits superior data efficiency and the reusable of expert-learned knowledge.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale generative models, such as diffusion and flow models, to align with complex human preferences and user-specified tasks. A fundamental limitation remains \textit{the curse of diversity collapse}, where the objective formulation and optimization landscape inherently collapse the policy to a Dirac delta distribution. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}ive\textbf{R}sity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Reinforcement \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning for Versatile Image Generation), an innovative framework that systematically incentivizes output diversity throughout the on-policy fine-tuning process, reconciling strong task alignment with high generation diversity to enhance versatility essential for applications that demand diverse candidate generations. We approach the problem across three representative perspectives: i) \textbf{sampling} a reward-concentrated subset that filters out reward outliers to prevent premature collapse; ii) \textbf{prompting} with stochastic variations to expand the conditioning space, and iii) \textbf{optimization} of the intra-group diversity with a potential-based reward shaping mechanism. Experimental results show that DRIFT achieves superior Pareto dominance regarding task alignment and generation diversity, yielding a $ 9.08\%\!\sim\! 43.46\%$ increase in diversity at equivalent alignment levels and a $ 59.65\% \!\sim\! 65.86\%$ increase in alignment at equivalent levels of diversity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12401v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weaknesses of Facial Emotion Recognition Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12402</link><description>arXiv:2601.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion detection from faces is one of the machine learning problems needed for human-computer interaction. The variety of methods used is enormous, which motivated an in-depth review of articles and scientific studies. Three of the most interesting and best solutions are selected, followed by the selection of three datasets that stood out for the diversity and number of images in them. The selected neural networks are trained, and then a series of experiments are performed to compare their performance, including testing on different datasets than a model was trained on. This reveals weaknesses in existing solutions, including differences between datasets, unequal levels of difficulty in recognizing certain emotions and the challenges in differentiating between closely related emotions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] De-Anonymization at Scale via Tournament-Style Attribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12407</link><description>arXiv:2601.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs rapidly advance and enter real-world use, their privacy implications are increasingly important. We study an authorship de-anonymization threat: using LLMs to link anonymous documents to their authors, potentially compromising settings such as double-blind peer review.
  We propose De-Anonymization at Scale (DAS), a large language model-based method for attributing authorship among tens of thousands of candidate texts. DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms. On standard authorship benchmarks (Enron emails and blog posts), DAS also improves both accuracy and scalability over prior approaches, highlighting a new LLM-enabled de-anonymization vulnerability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are LLMs Smarter Than Chimpanzees?

Abstract: Cognitive anthropology suggests that the distinction of human intelligence lies in the ability to infer other individuals' knowledge states and understand their intentions. In comparison, our closest animal relative, chimpanzees, lack the capacity to do so. With this paper, we aim to evaluate LLM performance in the area of knowledge state tracking and estimation. We design two tasks to test (1) if LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess, and (2) if LLMs can predict story characters' next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know. Results reveal that most current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve near-random performance on both tasks, and are substantially inferior to humans. We argue future LLM research should place more weight on the abilities of knowledge estimation and intention understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12410v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Orthogonalized Policy Optimization:Decoupling Sampling Geometry from Optimization Geometry in RLHF</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12415</link><description>arXiv:2601.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent alignment methods for large language models, including PPO, DPO, and IPO, are often presented as distinct algorithms. In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RLMiner: Finding the Most Frequent k-sized Subgraph via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12416</link><description>arXiv:2601.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ in a target graph is a fundamental graph mining problem with direct implications for Web-related data mining and social network analysis. Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12416v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Legal experts disagree with rationale extraction techniques for explaining ECtHR case outcome classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12419</link><description>arXiv:2601.12419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability is critical for applications of large language models in the legal domain which requires trust and transparency. While some studies develop task-specific approaches, other use the classification model's parameters to explain the decisions. However, which technique explains the legal outcome prediction best remains an open question. To address this challenge, we propose a comparative analysis framework for model-agnostic interpretability techniques. Among these, we employ two rationale extraction methods, which justify outcomes with human-interpretable and concise text fragments (i.e., rationales) from the given input text. We conduct comparison by evaluating faithfulness-via normalized sufficiency and comprehensiveness metrics along with plausibility-by asking legal experts to evaluate extracted rationales. We further assess the feasibility of LLM-as-a-Judge using legal expert evaluation results. We show that the model's "reasons" for predicting a violation differ substantially from those of legal experts, despite highly promising quantitative analysis results and reasonable downstream classification performance.

Abstract: Stereo vision between images faces a range of challenges, including occlusions, motion, and camera distortions, across applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and face analysis. Due to parameter sensitivity, further complications arise for stereo matching with sparse features, such as facial landmarks. To overcome this ill-posedness and enable unsupervised sparse matching, we consider line constraints of the camera geometry from an optimal transport (OT) viewpoint. Formulating camera-projected points as (half)lines, we propose the use of the classical epipolar distance as well as a 3D ray distance to quantify matching quality. Employing these distances as a cost function of a (partial) OT problem, we arrive at efficiently solvable assignment problems. Moreover, we extend our approach to unsupervised object matching by formulating it as a hierarchical OT problem. The resulting algorithms allow for efficient feature and object matching, as demonstrated in our numerical experiments. Here, we focus on applications in facial analysis, where we aim to match distinct landmarking conventions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12423v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph Attention Networks with Physical Constraints for Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12426</link><description>arXiv:2601.12426v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Cyclic codes are an important subclass of linear codes with wide applications in communication systems and data storage systems. In 2013, Ding and Helleseth presented nine open problems on optimal ternary cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$. While the first two and the sixth problems have been fully solved, others remain open. In this paper, we advance the study of the third and fourth open problems by providing the first counterexamples to both and constructing two families of optimal codes under certain conditions, thereby partially solving the third problem. Furthermore, we investigate the cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$ where $e(3^h\pm 1)\equiv\frac{3^m-a}{2}\pmod{3^m-1}$ and $a$ is odd. For $a\equiv 3\pmod{4}$, we present two new families of optimal codes with parameters $[3^m-1,3^m-1-2m,4]$, generalizing known constructions. For $a\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, we obtain several nonexistence results on optimal codes $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$ with the aforementioned parameters revealing the constraints of such codes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReWorld: Multi-Dimensional Reward Modeling for Embodied World Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12428</link><description>arXiv:2601.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, video-based world models that learn to simulate the dynamics have gained increasing attention in robot learning. However, current approaches primarily emphasize visual generative quality while overlooking physical fidelity, dynamic consistency, and task logic, especially for contact-rich manipulation tasks, which limits their applicability to downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce ReWorld, a framework aimed to employ reinforcement learning to align the video-based embodied world models with physical realism, task completion capability, embodiment plausibility and visual quality. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale (~235K) video preference dataset and employ it to train a hierarchical reward model designed to capture multi-dimensional reward consistent with human preferences. We further propose a practical alignment algorithm that post-trains flow-based world models using this reward through a computationally efficient PPO-style algorithm. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that ReWorld significantly improves the physical fidelity, logical coherence, embodiment and visual quality of generated rollouts, outperforming previous methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] System-Mediated Attention Imbalances Make Vision-Language Models Say Yes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12430</link><description>arXiv:2601.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) hallucination is commonly linked to imbalanced allocation of attention across input modalities: system, image and text. However, existing mitigation strategies tend towards an image-centric interpretation of these imbalances, often prioritising increased image attention while giving less consideration to the roles of the other modalities. In this study, we evaluate a more holistic, system-mediated account, which attributes these imbalances to functionally redundant system weights that reduce attention to image and textual inputs. We show that this framework offers a useful empirical perspective on the yes-bias, a common form of hallucination in which VLMs indiscriminately respond 'yes'. Causally redistributing attention from the system modality to image and textual inputs substantially suppresses this bias, often outperforming existing approaches. We further present evidence suggesting that system-mediated attention imbalances contribute to the yes-bias by encouraging a default reliance on coarse input representations, which are effective for some tasks but ill-suited to others. Taken together, these findings firmly establish system attention as a key factor in VLM hallucination and highlight its potential as a lever for mitigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SkeFi: Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer for Wireless Skeleton-Based Action Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12432</link><description>arXiv:2601.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition leverages human pose keypoints to categorize human actions, which shows superior generalization and interoperability compared to regular end-to-end action recognition. Existing solutions use RGB cameras to annotate skeletal keypoints, but their performance declines in dark environments and raises privacy concerns, limiting their use in smart homes and hospitals. This paper explores non-invasive wireless sensors, i.e., LiDAR and mmWave, to mitigate these challenges as a feasible alternative. Two problems are addressed: (1) insufficient data on wireless sensor modality to train an accurate skeleton estimation model, and (2) skeletal keypoints derived from wireless sensors are noisier than RGB, causing great difficulties for subsequent action recognition models. Our work, SkeFi, overcomes these gaps through a novel cross-modal knowledge transfer method acquired from the data-rich RGB modality. We propose the enhanced Temporal Correlation Adaptive Graph Convolution (TC-AGC) with frame interactive enhancement to overcome the noise from missing or inconsecutive frames. Additionally, our research underscores the effectiveness of enhancing multiscale temporal modeling through dual temporal convolution. By integrating TC-AGC with temporal modeling for cross-modal transfer, our framework can extract accurate poses and actions from noisy wireless sensors. Experiments demonstrate that SkeFi realizes state-of-the-art performances on mmWave and LiDAR.

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges constitute the single largest vector of systemic risk in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), accounting for over \$2.8 billion in losses since 2021. The fundamental vulnerability lies in the binary nature of existing bridge security models: a bridge is either fully operational or catastrophically compromised, with no intermediate state to contain partial failures. We present ASAS-BridgeAMM, a bridge-coupled automated market maker that introduces Contained Degradation: a formally specified operational state where the system gracefully degrades functionality in response to adversarial signals. By treating cross-chain message latency as a quantifiable execution risk, the protocol dynamically adjusts collateral haircuts, slippage bounds, and withdrawal limits. Across 18 months of historical replay on Ethereum and two auxiliary chains, ASAS-BridgeAMM reduces worst-case bridge-induced insolvency by 73% relative to baseline mint-and-burn architectures, while preserving 104.5% of transaction volume during stress periods. In rigorous adversarial simulations involving delayed finality, oracle manipulation, and liquidity griefing, the protocol maintains solvency with probability $&gt;0.9999$ and bounds per-epoch bad debt to $&lt;0.2%$ of total collateral.

Existing uncertainty quantification methods lack mechanisms to incorporate symbolic scientific knowledge, while neurosymbolic approaches operate deterministically without principled uncertainty modeling. We introduce the Constraint-Aware Neurosymbolic Uncertainty Framework (CANUF), unifying Bayesian deep learning with differentiable symbolic reasoning. The architecture comprises three components: automated constraint extraction from scientific literature, probabilistic neural backbone with variational inference, and differentiable constraint satisfaction layer ensuring physical consistency. Experiments on Materials Project (140,000+ materials), QM9 molecular properties, and climate benchmarks show CANUF reduces Expected Calibration Error by 34.7% versus Bayesian neural networks while maintaining 99.2% constraint satisfaction. Ablations reveal constraint-guided recalibration contributes 18.3% performance gain, with constraint extraction achieving 91.4% precision. CANUF provides the first end-to-end differentiable pipeline simultaneously addressing uncertainty quantification, constraint satisfaction, and interpretable explanations for scientific predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Defense in Vision-Language Models: An Overview</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12443</link><description>arXiv:2601.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of Vision Language Models (VLMs, e.g. CLIP) has raised concerns about their vulnerability to sophisticated and imperceptible adversarial attacks. These attacks could compromise model performance and system security in cross-modal tasks. To address this challenge, three main defense paradigms have been proposed: Training-time Defense, Test-time Adaptation Defense, and Training-free Defense. Training-time Defense involves modifying the training process, typically through adversarial fine-tuning to improve the robustness to adversarial examples. While effective, this approach requires substantial computational resources and may not generalize across all adversarial attacks. Test-time Adaptation Defense focuses on adapting the model at inference time by updating its parameters to handle unlabeled adversarial examples, offering flexibility but often at the cost of increased complexity and computational overhead. Training-free Defense avoids modifying the model itself, instead focusing on altering the adversarial inputs or their feature embeddings, which enforces input perturbations to mitigate the impact of attacks without additional training. This survey reviews the latest advancements in adversarial defense strategies for VLMs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of such approaches and discussing ongoing challenges in enhancing the robustness of VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12443v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Model for OWL Proofs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12444</link><description>arXiv:2601.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks such as deduction has been widely investigated in recent years. Yet, their capacity to generate proofs-faithful, human-readable explanations of why conclusions follow-remains largely under explored. In this work, we study proof generation in the context of OWL ontologies, which are widely adopted for representing and reasoning over complex knowledge, by developing an automated dataset construction and evaluation framework. Our evaluation encompassing three sequential tasks for complete proving: Extraction, Simplification, and Explanation, as well as an additional task of assessing Logic Completeness of the premise. Through extensive experiments on widely used reasoning LLMs, we achieve important findings including: (1) Some models achieve overall strong results but remain limited on complex cases; (2) Logical complexity, rather than representation format (formal logic language versus natural language), is the dominant factor shaping LLM performance; and (3) Noise and incompleteness in input data substantially diminish LLMs' performance. Together, these results underscore both the promise of LLMs for explanation with rigorous logics and the gap of supporting resilient reasoning under complex or imperfect conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed institutions without centralizing sensitive data; however, ensuring algorithmic fairness across heterogeneous data distributions while preserving privacy remains fundamentally unresolved. This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \log n) while maintaining (\dparam, \deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations. These results establish a practical pathway for deploying fairness-aware federated learning in regulated industries requiring both privacy protection and algorithmic accountability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12447v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Large Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection in Aerospace Software</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12448</link><description>arXiv:2601.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of aerospace software systems. Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates. These findings offer guidance for future LLM-based TSAD in aerospace software.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12448v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgenTRIM: Tool Risk Mitigation for Agentic AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12449</link><description>arXiv:2601.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems that combine LLMs with external tools to solve complex tasks. While such tools extend capability, improper tool permissions introduce security risks such as indirect prompt injection and tool misuse. We characterize these failures as unbalanced tool-driven agency. Agents may retain unnecessary permissions (excessive agency) or fail to invoke required tools (insufficient agency), amplifying the attack surface and reducing performance. We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls. Evaluating on the AgentDojo benchmark, AgenTRIM substantially reduces attack success while maintaining high task performance. Additional experiments show robustness to description-based attacks and effective enforcement of explicit safety policies. Together, these results demonstrate that AgenTRIM provides a practical, capability-preserving approach to safer tool use in LLM-based agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bringing Data Transformations Near-Memory for Low-Latency Analytics in HTAP Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12456</link><description>arXiv:2601.12456v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The demand of customized large language models (LLMs) has led to commercial LLMs offering black-box fine-tuning APIs, yet this convenience introduces a critical security loophole: attackers could jailbreak the LLMs by fine-tuning them with malicious data. Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., "bruaf") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12460v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large-scale EM Benchmark for Multi-Organelle Instance Segmentation in the Wild</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12464</link><description>arXiv:2601.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate instance-level segmentation of organelles in electron microscopy (EM) is critical for quantitative analysis of subcellular morphology and inter-organelle interactions. However, current benchmarks, based on small, curated datasets, fail to capture the inherent heterogeneity and large spatial context of in-the-wild EM data, imposing fundamental limitations on current patch-based methods. To address these limitations, we developed a large-scale, multi-source benchmark for multi-organelle instance segmentation, comprising over 100,000 2D EM images across variety cell types and five organelle classes that capture real-world variability. Dataset annotations were generated by our designed connectivity-aware Label Propagation Algorithm (3D LPA) with expert refinement. We further benchmarked several state-of-the-art models, including U-Net, SAM variants, and Mask2Former. Our results show several limitations: current models struggle to generalize across heterogeneous EM data and perform poorly on organelles with global, distributed morphologies (e.g., Endoplasmic Reticulum). These findings underscore the fundamental mismatch between local-context models and the challenge of modeling long-range structural continuity in the presence of real-world variability. The benchmark dataset and labeling tool will be publicly released soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12464v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Incentivizing In-depth Reasoning over Long Contexts with Process Advantage Shaping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12465</link><description>arXiv:2601.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in enhancing LLMs short-context reasoning, but its performance degrades in long-context scenarios that require both precise grounding and robust long-range reasoning. We identify the "almost-there" phenomenon in long-context reasoning, where trajectories are largely correct but fail at the final step, and attribute this failure to two factors: (1) the lack of high reasoning density in long-context QA data that push LLMs beyond mere grounding toward sophisticated multi-hop reasoning; and (2) the loss of valuable learning signals during long-context RL training due to the indiscriminate penalization of partially correct trajectories with incorrect outcomes. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose DeepReasonQA, a KG-driven synthesis framework that controllably constructs high-difficulty, multi-hop long-context QA pairs with inherent reasoning chains. Building on this, we introduce Long-context Process Advantage Shaping (LongPAS), a simple yet effective method that performs fine-grained credit assignment by evaluating reasoning steps along Validity and Relevance dimensions, which captures critical learning signals from "almost-there" trajectories. Experiments on three long-context reasoning benchmarks show that our approach substantially outperforms RLVR baselines and matches frontier LLMs while using far fewer parameters. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our methods in strengthening long-context reasoning while maintaining stable RL training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12465v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Patch-Level Tokenization with CNN Encoders and Attention for Improved Transformer Time-Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12467</link><description>arXiv:2601.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance in time-series forecasting by leveraging self-attention to model long-range temporal dependencies. However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12467v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DCAC: Dynamic Class-Aware Cache Creates Stronger Out-of-Distribution Detectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12468</link><description>arXiv:2601.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks, particularly due to overconfident predictions on unseen OOD samples during testing. We reveal a key insight: OOD samples predicted as the same class, or given high probabilities for it, are visually more similar to each other than to the true in-distribution (ID) samples. Motivated by this class-specific observation, we propose DCAC (Dynamic Class-Aware Cache), a training-free, test-time calibration module that maintains separate caches for each ID class to collect high-entropy samples and calibrate the raw predictions of input samples. DCAC leverages cached visual features and predicted probabilities through a lightweight two-layer module to mitigate overconfident predictions on OOD samples. This module can be seamlessly integrated with various existing OOD detection methods across both unimodal and vision-language models while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple OOD benchmarks demonstrate that DCAC significantly enhances existing methods, achieving substantial improvements, i.e., reducing FPR95 by 6.55% when integrated with ASH-S on ImageNet OOD benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12468v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowing When to Abstain: Medical LLMs Under Clinical Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12471</link><description>arXiv:2601.12471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation of large language models (LLMs) overwhelmingly prioritizes accuracy; however, in real-world and safety-critical applications, the ability to abstain when uncertain is equally vital for trustworthy deployment. We introduce MedAbstain, a unified benchmark and evaluation protocol for abstention in medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) -- a discrete-choice setting that generalizes to agentic action selection -- integrating conformal prediction, adversarial question perturbations, and explicit abstention options. Our systematic evaluation of both open- and closed-source LLMs reveals that even state-of-the-art, high-accuracy models often fail to abstain with uncertain. Notably, providing explicit abstention options consistently increases model uncertainty and safer abstention, far more than input perturbations, while scaling model size or advanced prompting brings little improvement. These findings highlight the central role of abstention mechanisms for trustworthy LLM deployment and offer practical guidance for improving safety in high-stakes applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Capability-Aware Early-Stage Research Idea Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12473</link><description>arXiv:2601.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of research ideas at their conceptual stage (i.e. before significant resources are committed) holds great potential for optimizing scientific resource allocation and research planning. While existing methods rely heavily on finished manuscripts or peer reviews, we propose a novel capability-aware framework that predicts paper acceptance and ratings using only author information and research ideas, without requiring full text or experimental results. Our approach integrates author information, (inferred) capability presentation, and research ideas through a three-way transformer architecture with flexible fusion mechanisms. We also introduce a two-stage architecture for learning the capability representation given the author information and idea. Experiments show that our method significantly outperform the single-way models by finetuning bert-base and bert-large, and the capability predicting significantly increase the predictive accuracy of the final model. The proposed method can be applied in both early-stage research outcome prediction and scientific resource allocation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12473v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language-Based Swarm Perception: Decentralized Person Re-Identification via Natural Language Descriptions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12479</link><description>arXiv:2601.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for decentralized person re-identification in robot swarms that leverages natural language as the primary representational modality. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on opaque visual embeddings -- high-dimensional feature vectors extracted from images -- the proposed method uses human-readable language to represent observations. Each robot locally detects and describes individuals using a vision-language model (VLM), producing textual descriptions of appearance instead of feature vectors. These descriptions are compared and clustered across the swarm without centralized coordination, allowing robots to collaboratively group observations of the same individual. Each cluster is distilled into a representative description by a language model, providing an interpretable, concise summary of the swarm's collective perception. This approach enables natural-language querying, enhances transparency, and supports explainable swarm behavior. Preliminary experiments demonstrate competitive performance in identity consistency and interpretability compared to embedding-based methods, despite current limitations in text similarity and computational load. Ongoing work explores refined similarity metrics, semantic navigation, and the extension of language-based perception to environmental elements. This work prioritizes decentralized perception and communication, while active navigation remains an open direction for future study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Neural Codec Language Model for Selective Editable Text to Speech Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12480</link><description>arXiv:2601.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural codec language models achieve impressive zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) by fully imitating the acoustic characteristics of a short speech prompt, including timbre, prosody, and paralinguistic information. However, such holistic imitation limits their ability to isolate and control individual attributes. In this paper, we present a unified codec language model SpeechEdit that extends zero-shot TTS with a selective control mechanism. By default, SpeechEdit reproduces the complete acoustic profile inferred from the speech prompt, but it selectively overrides only the attributes specified by explicit control instructions. To enable controllable modeling, SpeechEdit is trained on our newly constructed LibriEdit dataset, which provides delta (difference-aware) training pairs derived from LibriHeavy. Experimental results show that our approach maintains naturalness and robustness while offering flexible and localized control over desired attributes.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic animal fur geometry from images is a challenging task due to the fine-scale details, self-occlusion, and view-dependent appearance of fur. In contrast to human hairstyle reconstruction, there are also no datasets that can be leveraged to learn a fur prior for different animals. In this work, we present a first multi-view-based method for high-fidelity 3D fur modeling of animals using a strand-based representation, leveraging the general knowledge of a vision language model. Given multi-view RGB images, we first reconstruct a coarse surface geometry using traditional multi-view stereo techniques. We then use a vision language model (VLM) system to retrieve information about the realistic length structure of the fur for each part of the body. We use this knowledge to construct the animal's furless geometry and grow strands atop it. The fur reconstruction is supervised with both geometric and photometric losses computed from multi-view images. To mitigate orientation ambiguities stemming from the Gabor filters that are applied to the input images, we additionally utilize the VLM to guide the strands' growth direction and their relation to the gravity vector that we incorporate as a loss. With this new schema of using a VLM to guide 3D reconstruction from multi-view inputs, we show generalization across a variety of animals with different fur types.

Abstract: Shopping is a routine activity for sighted individuals, yet for people who are blind or have low vision (pBLV), locating and retrieving products in physical environments remains a challenge. This paper presents a multimodal wearable assistive system that integrates object detection with vision-language models to support independent product or item retrieval, with the goal of enhancing users'autonomy and sense of agency. The system operates through three phases: product search, which identifies target products using YOLO-World detection combined with embedding similarity and color histogram matching; product navigation, which provides spatialized sonification and VLM-generated verbal descriptions to guide users toward the target; and product correction, which verifies whether the user has reached the correct product and provides corrective feedback when necessary. Technical evaluation demonstrated promising performance across all modules, with product detection achieving near-perfect accuracy at close range and high accuracy when facing shelves within 1.5 m. VLM-based navigation achieved up to 94.4% accuracy, and correction accuracy exceeded 86% under optimal model configurations. These results demonstrate the system's potential to address the last-meter problem in assistive shopping. Future work will focus on user studies with pBLV participants and integration with multi-scale navigation ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12486v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VASTU: Value-Aligned Social Toolkit for Online Content Curation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12491</link><description>arXiv:2601.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting what content communities value is a foundational challenge for social computing systems -- from feed curation and content ranking to moderation tools and personalized recommendation systems. Yet existing approaches remain fragmented across methodological paradigms, and it remains unclear which methods best capture community-specific notions of value. We introduce VASTU (Value-Aligned Social Toolkit for Online Content Curation), a benchmark and evaluation framework for systematically comparing approaches to detecting community-valued content. VASTU includes a dataset of 75,000 comments from 15 diverse Reddit communities, annotated with community approval labels and rich linguistic features. Using VASTU, we evaluate feature-based models, transformers, prompted and fine-tuned language models under global versus community-specific training regimes. We find that community-specific models consistently outperform global approaches, with fine-tuned transformers achieving the strongest performance (0.72 AUROC). Notably, fine-tuned SLMs (0.65 AUROC) substantially outperform prompted LLMs (0.60 AUROC) despite being 100 times smaller. Counterintuitively, chain-of-thought prompting provides no benefit, and reasoning models perform the worst (0.53 AUROC), suggesting this task requires learning community norms rather than test-time reasoning. By releasing VASTU, we provide a standardized benchmark to advance research on value-aligned sociotechnical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12491v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Histopath-C: Towards Realistic Domain Shifts for Histopathology Vision-Language Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12493</link><description>arXiv:2601.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performances in various medical imaging domains such as histo\-pathology by leveraging pre-trained, contrastive models that exploit visual and textual information. However, histopathology images may exhibit severe domain shifts, such as staining, contamination, blurring, and noise, which may severely degrade the VLM's downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Histopath-C, a new benchmark with realistic synthetic corruptions designed to mimic real-world distribution shifts observed in digital histopathology. Our framework dynamically applies corruptions to any available dataset and evaluates Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) mechanisms on the fly. We then propose LATTE, a transductive, low-rank adaptation strategy that exploits multiple text templates, mitigating the sensitivity of histopathology VLMs to diverse text inputs.

Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) enable unified speech understanding and generation, yet their adaptation to linguistically complex, dialect-rich settings remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of multi-task instruction tuning for an Arabic-centric audio LLM, covering a hierarchy of generative tasks (ASR, speech summarization) and discriminative tasks (dialect and emotion identification). To support this study, we introduce AraMega-SSum, a novel dataset for Arabic speech summarization. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Omni (7B) and propose Task-Progressive Curriculum (TPC) along with Aligner-Based Diverse Sampling (ADS), a strategy that constructs information-dense batches by selecting task- and label-balanced examples. Our results reveal a critical efficiency, robustness trade-off: while ADS accelerates initial convergence and boosts paralinguistic F1-scores, its inherent gradient volatility can destabilize generative decoding under prolonged training. Furthermore, while the TPC stabilizes core acoustic mapping, it often induces negative transfer in downstream tasks. We demonstrate that a Hybrid TPC+ADS Strategy provides an optimal training ``recipe'', first establishing a robust representative foundation before employing diversity-aware refinement to capture fine-grained nuances. These findings offer practical guidance for the efficient adaptation of Omni-models in complex, low-resource multimodal environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12494v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Failure Modes in Multi-Hop QA: The Weakest Link Law and the Recognition Bottleneck</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12499</link><description>arXiv:2601.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite scaling to massive context windows, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with multi-hop reasoning due to inherent position bias, which causes them to overlook information at certain positions. Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the "Weakest Link Law": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $&lt;3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that "thinking" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12499v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Video Individual Counting and Tracking from Moving Drones: A Benchmark and Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12500</link><description>arXiv:2601.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting and tracking dense crowds in large-scale scenes is highly challenging, yet existing methods mainly rely on datasets captured by fixed cameras, which provide limited spatial coverage and are inadequate for large-scale dense crowd analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a flexible solution using moving drones to capture videos and perform video-level crowd counting and tracking of unique pedestrians across entire scenes. We introduce MovingDroneCrowd++, the largest video-level dataset for dense crowd counting and tracking captured by moving drones, covering diverse and complex conditions with varying flight altitudes, camera angles, and illumination. Existing methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this dataset. To this end, we propose GD3A (Global Density Map Decomposition via Descriptor Association), a density map-based video individual counting method that avoids explicit localization. GD3A establishes pixel-level correspondences between pedestrian descriptors across consecutive frames via optimal transport with an adaptive dustbin score, enabling the decomposition of global density maps into shared, inflow, and outflow components. Building on this framework, we further introduce DVTrack, which converts descriptor-level matching into instance-level associations through a descriptor voting mechanism for pedestrian tracking. Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches under dense crowds and complex motion, reducing counting error by 47.4 percent and improving tracking performance by 39.2 percent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semidefinite Programming for Quantum Channel Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12502</link><description>arXiv:2601.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of reconstructing a quantum channel from a sample of classical data is considered. When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12502v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DoPE: Decoy Oriented Perturbation Encapsulation Human-Readable, AI-Hostile Documents for Academic Integrity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12505</link><description>arXiv:2601.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can directly consume exam documents, threatening conventional assessments and academic integrity. We present DoPE (Decoy-Oriented Perturbation Encapsulation), a document-layer defense framework that embeds semantic decoys into PDF/HTML assessments to exploit render-parse discrepancies in MLLM pipelines. By instrumenting exams at authoring time, DoPE provides model-agnostic prevention (stop or confound automated solving) and detection (flag blind AI reliance) without relying on conventional one-shot classifiers. We formalize prevention and detection tasks, and introduce FewSoRT-Q, an LLM-guided pipeline that generates question-level semantic decoys and FewSoRT-D to encapsulate them into watermarked documents. We evaluate on Integrity-Bench, a novel benchmark of 1826 exams (PDF+HTML) derived from public QA datasets and OpenCourseWare. Against black-box MLLMs from OpenAI and Anthropic, DoPE yields strong empirical gains: a 91.4% detection rate at an 8.7% false-positive rate using an LLM-as-Judge verifier, and prevents successful completion or induces decoy-aligned failures in 96.3% of attempts. We release Integrity-Bench, our toolkit, and evaluation code to enable reproducible study of document-layer defenses for academic integrity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SDCoNet: Saliency-Driven Multi-Task Collaborative Network for Remote Sensing Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12507</link><description>arXiv:2601.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In remote sensing images, complex backgrounds, weak object signals, and small object scales make accurate detection particularly challenging, especially under low-quality imaging conditions. A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet repeated syndrome-measurement cycles dominate its spacetime and hardware cost. Although stabilizers commute and admit many valid execution orders, different schedules induce distinct error-propagation paths under realistic noise, leading to large variations in logical error rate. Outside of surface codes, effective syndrome-measurement scheduling remains largely unexplored. We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12509v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fine-Tuning Cycle-GAN for Domain Adaptation of MRI Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12512</link><description>arXiv:2601.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans acquired from different scanners or institutions often suffer from domain shifts owing to variations in hardware, protocols, and acquisition parameters. This discrepancy degrades the performance of deep learning models trained on source domain data when applied to target domain images. In this study, we propose a Cycle-GAN-based model for unsupervised medical-image domain adaptation. Leveraging CycleGANs, our model learns bidirectional mappings between the source and target domains without paired training data, preserving the anatomical content of the images. By leveraging Cycle-GAN capabilities with content and disparity loss for adaptation tasks, we ensured image-domain adaptation while maintaining image integrity. Several experiments on MRI datasets demonstrated the efficacy of our model in bidirectional domain adaptation without labelled data. Furthermore, research offers promising avenues for improving the diagnostic accuracy of healthcare. The statistical results confirm that our approach improves model performance and reduces domain-related variability, thus contributing to more precise and consistent medical image analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12512v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cooperative Multi-agent RL with Communication Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12518</link><description>arXiv:2601.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative MARL often assumes frequent access to global information in a data buffer, such as team rewards or other agents' actions, which is typically unrealistic in decentralized MARL systems due to high communication costs. When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\max_i |A_i|)\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum. Empirically, we test the base policy prediction algorithm in both simulated games and MAPPO for complex environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12518v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Relativistic Geodesics and Chaotic Dynamics via Stabilized Lagrangian Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12519</link><description>arXiv:2601.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) can learn arbitrary Lagrangians from trajectory data, but their unusual optimization objective leads to significant training instabilities that limit their application to complex systems. We propose several improvements that address these fundamental challenges, namely, a Hessian regularization scheme that penalizes unphysical signatures in the Lagrangian's second derivatives with respect to velocities, preventing the network from learning unstable dynamics, activation functions that are better suited to the problem of learning Lagrangians, and a physics-aware coordinate scaling that improves stability. We systematically evaluate these techniques alongside previously proposed methods for improving stability. Our improved architecture successfully trains on systems of unprecedented complexity, including triple pendulums, and achieved 96.6\% lower validation loss value and 90.68\% better stability than baseline LNNs in double pendulum systems. With the improved framework, we show that our LNNs can learn Lagrangians representing geodesic motion in both non-relativistic and general relativistic settings. To deal with the relativistic setting, we extended our regularization to penalize violations of Lorentzian signatures, which allowed us to predict a geodesic Lagrangian under AdS\textsubscript{4} spacetime metric directly from trajectory data, which to our knowledge has not been done in the literature before. This opens new possibilities for automated discovery of geometric structures in physics, including extraction of spacetime metric tensor components from geodesic trajectories. While our approach inherits some limitations of the original LNN framework, particularly the requirement for invertible Hessians, it significantly expands the practical applicability of LNNs for scientific discovery tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12519v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved Bug Localization with AI Agents Leveraging Hypothesis and Dynamic Cognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12522</link><description>arXiv:2601.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software bugs cost technology providers (e.g., AT&amp;amp;T) billions annually and cause developers to spend roughly 50% of their time on bug resolution. Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12522v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enabling High-Curvature Navigation in Eversion Robots through Buckle-Inducing Constrictive Bands</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12523</link><description>arXiv:2601.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip-growing eversion robots are renowned for their ability to access remote spaces through narrow passages. However, achieving reliable navigation remains a significant challenge. Existing solutions often rely on artificial muscles integrated into the robot body or active tip-steering mechanisms. While effective, these additions introduce structural complexity and compromise the defining advantages of eversion robots: their inherent softness and compliance. In this paper, we propose a passive approach to reduce bending stiffness by purposefully introducing buckling points along the robot's outer wall. We achieve this by integrating inextensible diameter-reducing circumferential bands at regular intervals along the robot body facilitating forward motion through tortuous, obstacle cluttered paths. Rather than relying on active steering, our approach leverages the robot's natural interaction with the environment, allowing for smooth, compliant navigation. We present a Cosserat rod-based mathematical model to quantify this behavior, capturing the local stiffness reductions caused by the constricting bands and their impact on global bending mechanics. Experimental results demonstrate that these bands reduce the robot's stiffness when bent at the tip by up to 91 percent, enabling consistent traversal of 180 degree bends with a bending radius of as low as 25 mm-notably lower than the 35 mm achievable by standard eversion robots under identical conditions. The feasibility of the proposed method is further demonstrated through a case study in a colon phantom. By significantly improving maneuverability without sacrificing softness or increasing mechanical complexity, this approach expands the applicability of eversion robots in highly curved pathways, whether in relation to pipe inspection or medical procedures such as colonoscopy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12523v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SGCP: A Self-Organized Game-Theoretic Framework For Collaborative Perception</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12524</link><description>arXiv:2601.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception holds great promise for improving safety in autonomous driving, particularly in dense traffic where vehicles can share sensory information to overcome individual blind spots and extend awareness. However, deploying such collaboration at scale remains difficult when communication bandwidth is limited and no roadside infrastructure is available. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fully decentralized framework that enables vehicles to self organize into cooperative groups using only vehicle to vehicle communication. The approach decomposes the problem into two sequential game theoretic stages. In the first stage, vehicles form stable clusters by evaluating mutual sensing complementarity and motion coherence, and each cluster elects a coordinator. In the second stage, the coordinator guides its members to selectively transmit point cloud segments from perceptually salient regions through a non cooperative potential game, enabling efficient local fusion. Global scene understanding is then achieved by exchanging compact detection messages across clusters rather than raw sensor data. We design distributed algorithms for both stages that guarantee monotonic improvement of the system wide potential function. Comprehensive experiments on the CARLA-OpenCDA-NS3 co-simulation platform show that our method reduces communication overhead while delivering higher perception accuracy and wider effective coverage compared to existing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12524v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Feature Deformation Weights</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12527</link><description>arXiv:2601.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handle-based mesh deformation has been a long-standing paradigm in computer graphics, enabling intuitive shape edits from sparse controls. Classic techniques offer precise and rapid deformation control. However, they solve an optimization problem with constraints defined by control handle placement, requiring a user to know apriori the ideal distribution of handles on the shape to accomplish the desired edit. The mapping from handle set to deformation behavior is often unintuitive and, importantly, non-semantic. Modern data-driven methods, on the other hand, leverage a data prior to obtain semantic edits, but are slow and imprecise. We propose a technique that fuses the semantic prior of data with the precise control and speed of traditional frameworks. Our approach is surprisingly simple yet effective: deep feature proximity makes for smooth and semantic deformation weights, with no need for additional regularization. The weights can be computed in real-time for any surface point, whereas prior methods require optimization for new handles. Moreover, the semantic prior from deep features enables co-deformation of semantic parts. We introduce an improved feature distillation pipeline, barycentric feature distillation, which efficiently uses the visual signal from shape renders to minimize distillation cost. This allows our weights to be computed for high resolution meshes in under a minute, in contrast to potentially hours for both classical and neural methods. We preserve and extend properties of classical methods through feature space constraints and locality weighting. Our field representation allows for automatic detection of semantic symmetries, which we use to produce symmetry-preserving deformations. We show a proof-of-concept application which can produce deformations for meshes up to 1 million faces in real-time on a consumer-grade machine.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How to Get Close to the Median Shape</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12529</link><description>arXiv:2601.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\renewcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}\newcommand{\eps}{{\varepsilon}}\newcommand{\poly}{\mathrm{poly}} $In this paper, we study the problem of $L_1$-fitting a shape to a set of $n$ points in $\Re^d$ (where $d$ is a fixed constant), where the target is to minimize the sum of distances of the points to the shape, or the sum of squared distances. We present a general technique for computing a $(1 + \eps ) $-approximation for such a problem, with running time $O(n + \poly( \log n, 1/\eps))$, where $\poly(\log n, 1/\eps)$ is a polynomial of constant degree of $\log n$ and $1/\eps$ (the power of the polynomial is a function of $d$). The new algorithm runs in linear time for a fixed $\eps&gt;0$, and is the first subquadratic algorithm for this problem.
  Applications of the algorithm include best fitting either a circle, a sphere, or a cylinder to a set of points when minimizing the sum of distances (or squared distances) to the respective shape.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] XRefine: Attention-Guided Keypoint Match Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12530</link><description>arXiv:2601.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse keypoint matching is crucial for 3D vision tasks, yet current keypoint detectors often produce spatially inaccurate matches. Existing refinement methods mitigate this issue through alignment of matched keypoint locations, but they are typically detector-specific, requiring retraining for each keypoint detector. We introduce XRefine, a novel, detector-agnostic approach for sub-pixel keypoint refinement that operates solely on image patches centered at matched keypoints. Our cross-attention-based architecture learns to predict refined keypoint coordinates without relying on internal detector representations, enabling generalization across detectors. Furthermore, XRefine can be extended to handle multi-view feature tracks. Experiments on MegaDepth, KITTI, and ScanNet demonstrate that the approach consistently improves geometric estimation accuracy, achieving superior performance compared to existing refinement methods while maintaining runtime efficiency.

Abstract: The relationship between emotional expression and eye movement is well-documented, with literature establishing gaze patterns are reliable indicators of emotion. However, most studies utilize specialized, high-resolution eye-tracking equipment, limiting the potential reach of findings. We investigate how eye movement can be used to predict multimodal markers of emotional expression from naturalistic, low-resolution videos. We utilize a collection of video interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive with Holocaust survivors as they recount their experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Inspired by pretraining methods on language models, we develop a novel gaze detection model that uses self-supervised eye movement reconstruction that can effectively leverage unlabeled video. We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech. The second task is using eye gaze as a predictor of three momentary manifestations of emotional behaviors: laughing, crying/sobbing, and sighing. We find our new model is predictive of emotion outcomes and observe a positive correlation between pretraining performance and emotion processing performance for both experiments. We conclude self-supervised eye movement reconstruction is an effective method for encoding the affective signal they carry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12534v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation via Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12535</link><description>arXiv:2601.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) has gained increasing attention as parallel data from low-resource language communities is collected, but many potential methods for improving low-resource MT remain unexplored. We investigate a self-supervised reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning for translation in low-resource settings using round-trip bootstrapping with the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) family of models. Our approach translates English into a target low-resource language and then back into English, using a combination of chrF++ and BLEU as the reward function on the reconstructed English sentences. Using the NLLB-MD dataset, we evaluate both the 600M and 1.3B parameter NLLB models and observe consistent improvements for the following languages: Central Aymara, Friulian, Wolof and Russian. Qualitative inspection of translation outputs indicates increased fluency and semantic fidelity. We argue that our method can further benefit from scale, enabling models to increasingly leverage their pretrained knowledge and continue self-improving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Reasoning for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12538</link><description>arXiv:2601.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process underlying inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12538v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MemeLens: Multilingual Multitask VLMs for Memes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12539</link><description>arXiv:2601.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memes are a dominant medium for online communication and manipulation because meaning emerges from interactions between embedded text, imagery, and cultural context. Existing meme research is distributed across tasks (hate, misogyny, propaganda, sentiment, humour) and languages, which limits cross-domain generalization. To address this gap we propose MemeLens, a unified multilingual and multitask explanation-enhanced Vision Language Model (VLM) for meme understanding. We consolidate 38 public meme datasets, filter and map dataset-specific labels into a shared taxonomy of $20$ tasks spanning harm, targets, figurative/pragmatic intent, and affect. We present a comprehensive empirical analysis across modeling paradigms, task categories, and datasets. Our findings suggest that robust meme understanding requires multimodal training, exhibits substantial variation across semantic categories, and remains sensitive to over-specialization when models are fine-tuned on individual datasets rather than trained in a unified setting. We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12539v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking the AI Scientist: Interactive Multi-Agent Workflows for Scientific Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12542</link><description>arXiv:2601.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems for scientific discovery have demonstrated remarkable potential, yet existing approaches remain largely proprietary and operate in batch-processing modes requiring hours per research cycle, precluding real-time researcher guidance. This paper introduces Deep Research, a multi-agent system enabling interactive scientific investigation with turnaround times measured in minutes. The architecture comprises specialized agents for planning, data analysis, literature search, and novelty detection, unified through a persistent world state that maintains context across iterative research cycles. Two operational modes support different workflows: semi-autonomous mode with selective human checkpoints, and fully autonomous mode for extended investigations. Evaluation on the BixBench computational biology benchmark demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving 48.8% accuracy on open response and 64.5% on multiple-choice evaluation, exceeding existing baselines by 14 to 26 percentage points. Analysis of architectural constraints, including open access literature limitations and challenges inherent to automated novelty assessment, informs practical deployment considerations for AI-assisted scientific workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12542v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Press Start to Charge: Videogaming the Online Centralized Charging Scheduling Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12543</link><description>arXiv:2601.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the online centralized charging scheduling problem (OCCSP). In this problem, a central authority must decide, in real time, when to charge dynamically arriving electric vehicles (EVs), subject to capacity limits, with the objective of balancing load across a finite planning horizon. To solve the problem, we first gamify it; that is, we model it as a game where charging blocks are placed within temporal and capacity constraints on a grid. We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses. These operational gains translate into tangible economic value. In a real-world case study for the Greater Montr\'eal Area (Qu\'ebec, Canada) using utility cost data, the proposed methods lower system costs by tens of millions of dollars per year over the prevailing practice and show clear potential to delay costly grid upgrades.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12543v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Information Farming: From Berry Picking to Berry Growing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12544</link><description>arXiv:2601.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic paradigms of Berry Picking and Information Foraging Theory have framed users as gatherers, opportunistically searching across distributed sources to satisfy evolving information needs. However, the rise of GenAI is driving a fundamental transformation in how people produce, structure, and reuse information - one that these paradigms no longer fully capture. This transformation is analogous to the Neolithic Revolution, when societies shifted from hunting and gathering to cultivation. Generative technologies empower users to "farm" information by planting seeds in the form of prompts, cultivating workflows over time, and harvesting richly structured, relevant yields within their own plots, rather than foraging across others people's patches. In this perspectives paper, we introduce the notion of Information Farming as a conceptual framework and argue that it represents a natural evolution in how people engage with information. Drawing on historical analogy and empirical evidence, we examine the benefits and opportunities of information farming, its implications for design and evaluation, and the accompanying risks posed by this transition. We hypothesize that as GenAI technologies proliferate, cultivating information will increasingly supplant transient, patch-based foraging as a dominant mode of engagement, marking a broader shift in human-information interaction and its study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Clinicians Think and What AI Can Learn From It</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12547</link><description>arXiv:2601.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most clinical AI systems operate as prediction engines -- producing labels or risk scores -- yet real clinical reasoning is a time-bounded, sequential control problem under uncertainty. Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\to$ perception $\to$ inference $\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($\epsilon$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12547v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Traffic Collisions: Temporal Patterns and Severity-Weighted Hotspot Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12548</link><description>arXiv:2601.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding traffic collision patterns is of high importance for effective road safety planning in fast-growing urban environments. This study examines the temporal and spatial patterns of traffic collisions in Dubai, UAE, with a particular focus on collision severity. To this end, traffic collision records from November 2024 to June 2025 were analyzed to examine hourly, daily, and monthly variations in collision frequency and severity for both overall traffic collisions and pedestrian-related accidents. Temporal associations with severity were evaluated using chi-square tests and Cramer's V, while spatial patterns were analyzed using severity-weighted hotspot analysis based on the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, complemented by inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation. The results show a clear temporal variation in overall collision frequency and severity, with higher collision frequencies during evening and nighttime periods with 44% higher probability of high-severity outcomes at night compared to the afternoon. On the other hand, pedestrian-related accidents showed a distinct temporal profile, characterized by higher occurrence during late-evening hours and relatively limited variation across days of the week and months. Spatial analysis identified statistically significant severity hotspots for overall collisions in the northern and northwestern parts of Dubai and along the Al Ain-Dubai Highway, while pedestrian severity hotspots were concentrated near industrial areas in the southwestern region. Several policy measures are proposed based on the findings including, reducing nighttime speed limits, enhancing automated enforcement, improving roadway lighting, and implementing pedestrian-focused treatments in statistically significant hotspots.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Concept-Spilling Across Languages in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12549</link><description>arXiv:2601.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable cross-lingual abilities, yet often exhibit a systematic bias toward the representations from other languages, resulting in semantic interference when generating content in non-English languages$-$a phenomenon we define as language spilling. This paper presents a novel comparative framework for evaluating multilingual semantic robustness by systematically measuring how models handle polysemous words across languages. Our methodology provides a relative measure of model performance: when required to generate exactly five meanings, both strong and weak models may resort to meanings from dominant languages, but semantically stronger models do so later in the generation sequence, producing more true meanings from the target language before failing, while weaker models resort to dominant-language meanings earlier in the sequence. We evaluate a diverse set of open and closed multilingual LLMs using a structured meaning generation task across nine languages, employing a carefully curated benchmark of 100 high-polysemy English words. Our findings reveal significant variation in semantic robustness across both models and languages, providing a principled ranking system for model comparison without requiring definitive causal attribution of error sources. We contribute both a scalable comparative benchmark for multilingual semantic evaluation and a rigorous validation pipeline$-$critical tools for developing more linguistically balanced AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12549v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PISE: Physics-Anchored Semantically-Enhanced Deep Computational Ghost Imaging for Robust Low-Bandwidth Machine Perception</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12551</link><description>arXiv:2601.12551v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can recall a wide range of factual knowledge across languages. However, existing factual recall evaluations primarily assess fact retrieval in isolation, where the queried entity is explicitly named and the fact is requested directly. In natural language use, facts are often accessed through context, where the relevant entity is introduced only indirectly. In this work, we study contextually mediated factual recall, asking whether LLMs can reliably retrieve factual knowledge when the target entity is embedded in a naturalistic context rather than queried explicitly, across languages. We construct controlled prompts that preserve the underlying fact while introducing referential mediation through contextual sentences. To disentangle contextual effects from name-specific associations, we further compare performance using synthetic names and real names across languages. Evaluating multiple model families in five languages, we find that contextual mediation consistently degrades factual recall, with substantial variation across relations. Larger models are more robust to contextual mediation, exhibiting a reduced performance gap relative to direct queries, while the effect of real names and name origin is mixed and unsystematic. These findings highlight a gap between isolated factual recall and context-dependent language understanding in multilingual LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12555v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Life, Machine Learning, and the Search for Habitability: Predicting Biosignature Fluxes for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12557</link><description>arXiv:2601.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future direct-imaging flagship missions, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), face critical decisions in prioritizing observations due to extremely stringent time and resource constraints. In this paper, we introduce two advanced machine-learning architectures tailored for predicting biosignature species fluxes from exoplanetary reflected-light spectra: a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) and our novel model architecture, the Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT). The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability. These capabilities position our methods as promising tools for accelerating target triage, optimizing observation schedules, and maximizing scientific return for upcoming flagship missions such as HWO.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12557v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Tool Support for Category-Partition Testing: Design Decisions, UI and Examples of Use</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12559</link><description>arXiv:2601.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category-Partition is a functional testing technique that is based on the idea that the input domain of the system under test can be divided into sub-domains, with the assumption that inputs that belong to the same sub-domain trigger a similar behaviour and that therefore it is sufficient to select one input from each sub-domain. Category-Partition proceeds in several steps, from the identification of so-called categories and choices, possibly constrained, which are subsequently used to form test frames, i.e., combinations of choices, and eventually test cases. This paper reports on an ongoing attempt to automate as many of those steps as possible, with graphical-user interface tool support. Specifically, the user interface allows the user to specify parameters as well as so-called environment variables, further specify categories and choices with optional constraints. Choices are provided with precise specifications with operations specific to their types (e.g., Boolean, Integer, Real, String). Then, the tool automates the construction of test frames, which are combinations of choices, according to alternative selection criteria, and the identification of input values for parameters and environment variables for these test frames, thereby producing test cases. The paper illustrates the capabilities of the tool with the use of nine different case studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12559v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI): Architectures, Taxonomies, and Evaluation of Large Language Model Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12560</link><description>arXiv:2601.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is moving from models that only generate text to Agentic AI, where systems behave as autonomous entities that can perceive, reason, plan, and act. Large Language Models (LLMs) are no longer used only as passive knowledge engines but as cognitive controllers that combine memory, tool use, and feedback from their environment to pursue extended goals. This shift already supports the automation of complex workflows in software engineering, scientific discovery, and web navigation, yet the variety of emerging designs, from simple single loop agents to hierarchical multi agent systems, makes the landscape hard to navigate. In this paper, we investigate architectures and propose a unified taxonomy that breaks agents into Perception, Brain, Planning, Action, Tool Use, and Collaboration. We use this lens to describe the move from linear reasoning procedures to native inference time reasoning models, and the transition from fixed API calls to open standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Native Computer Use. We also group the environments in which these agents operate, including digital operating systems, embodied robotics, and other specialized domains, and we review current evaluation practices. Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as hallucination in action, infinite loops, and prompt injection, and outline future research directions toward more robust and reliable autonomous systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12560v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Camera Pose Revisited</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12567</link><description>arXiv:2601.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the position and orientation of a camera with respect to an observed scene is one of the central problems in computer vision, particularly in the context of camera calibration and multi-sensor systems. This paper addresses the planar Perspective--$n$--Point problem, with special emphasis on the initial estimation of the pose of a calibration object. As a solution, we propose the \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm, which combines the classical quadratic formulation of the reconstruction error with a Cayley parameterization of rotations and least-squares optimization. The key component of the method is a deterministic selection of starting points based on an analysis of the reconstruction error for two canonical vectors, allowing costly solution-space search procedures to be avoided. Experimental validation is performed using data acquired also from high-resolution RGB cameras and very low-resolution thermal cameras in an integrated RGB--IR setup. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves practically the same projection accuracy as optimal \texttt{SQPnP} and slightly higher than \texttt{IPPE}, both prominent \texttt{PnP-OpenCV} procedures. However, \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} maintains a significantly simpler algorithmic structure. Moreover, the analysis of optimization trajectories in Cayley space provides an intuitive insight into the convergence process, making the method attractive also from a didactic perspective. Unlike existing PnP solvers, the proposed \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm combines projection error minimization with an analytically eliminated reconstruction-error surrogate for translation, yielding a hybrid cost formulation that is both geometrically transparent and computationally efficient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Origin of the Inaccessible Game</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12576</link><description>arXiv:2601.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inaccessible game is an information-geometric framework where dynamics of information loss emerge from maximum entropy production under marginal-entropy conservation.
  We study the game's starting state, the origin. Classical Shannon entropy forbids a representation with zero joint entropy and positive marginal entropies: non-negativity of conditional entropy rules this out. Replacing Shannon with von Neumann entropy within the Baez Fritz Leinster Parzygnat categorical framework removes this obstruction and admits a well-defined origin: a globally pure state with maximally mixed marginals, selected up to local-unitary equivalence. At this LME origin, marginal-entropy conservation becomes a second-order geometric condition. Because the marginal-entropy sum is saturated termwise, the constraint gradient vanishes and first-order tangency is vacuous; admissible directions are selected by the kernel of the constraint Hessian, characterised by the marginal-preserving tangent space.
  We derive the constrained gradient flow in the matrix exponential family and show that, as the origin is approached, the affine time parameter degenerates. This motivates an axiomatically distinguished reparametrisation, entropy time $t$, defined by $dH/dt = c$ for fixed constant $c&gt;0$. In this parametrisation, the infinite affine-time approach to the boundary maps to a finite entropy-time interval. The constrained dynamics split into a symmetric dissipative component realising SEA and a reversible component represented as unitary evolution.
  As in the classical game, marginal-entropy conservation is equivalent to conservation of a sum of local modular Hamiltonian expectations, a state-dependent "modular energy"; in Gibbs regimes where local modular generators become approximately parameter-invariant, this reduces to familiar fixed-energy constraints from nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12576v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic Fusion: Verifiable Alignment in Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12580</link><description>arXiv:2601.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Semantic Fusion (SF), a formal framework for decentralized semantic coordination in multi-agent systems. SF allows agents to operate over scoped views of shared memory, propose structured updates, and maintain global coherence through local ontology-based validation and refresh without centralized control or explicit message passing. The central theoretical result is a bisimulation theorem showing that each agent's local execution is behaviorally equivalent to its projection of the global semantics, in both deterministic and probabilistic settings. This enables safety, liveness, and temporal properties to be verified locally and soundly lifted to the full system. SF supports agents whose update proposals vary across invocations, including those generated by learned or heuristic components, provided updates pass semantic validation before integration. We establish deterministic and probabilistic guarantees ensuring semantic alignment under asynchronous or degraded communication. To validate the model operationally, we implement a lightweight reference architecture that instantiates its core mechanisms. A 250-agent simulation evaluates these properties across over 11,000 validated updates, demonstrating convergence under probabilistic refresh, bounded communication, and resilience to agent failure. Together, these results show that Semantic Fusion can provide a formal and scalable basis for verifiable autonomy in decentralized systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12580v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do MLLMs See What We See?

We present the first systematic analysis of barriers to visualization literacy in MLLMs. Using the regenerated Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (reVLAT) benchmark with synthetic data, we open-coded 309 erroneous responses from four state-of-the-art models with a barrier-centric strategy adapted from human visualization literacy research. Our analysis yields a taxonomy of MLLM failures, revealing two machine-specific barriers that extend prior human-participation frameworks. Results show that models perform well on simple charts but struggle with color-intensive, segment-based visualizations, often failing to form consistent comparative reasoning.

Abstract: People's identities change during life transitions, e.g., studying abroad. They bring everyday objects that embody memories and reflect their identities during such moves. To assist in these transitions, we ask how people's human identities could be influenced by their objects through an artificial agent. This paper presents an exploratory research-through-design study around how people undergoing life transitions experience conversing with their everyday objects through a chatbot. Drawing on a two-week field deployment and interviews with 12 participants, we contribute (1) a conceptualization of 'trans-embodiment' describing the asynchronous imagination of object and human identities on the chatbot, (2) empirical evidence of the resulting emotional and reflective experiences, and (3) three types of object identities for designing conversational agents that role-play objects. Our contributions sum up to triangulating human-agent-object identity as trans-embodiment in supporting life transitions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SmoothCLAP: Soft-Target Enhanced Contrastive Language\--Audio Pretraining for Affective Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12591</link><description>arXiv:2601.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ambiguity of human emotions poses several challenges for machine learning models, as they often overlap and lack clear delineating boundaries. Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) has emerged as a key technique for generalisable emotion recognition. However, as conventional CLAP enforces a strict one-to-one alignment between paired audio-text samples, it overlooks intra-modal similarity and treats all non-matching pairs as equally negative. This conflicts with the fuzzy boundaries between different emotions. To address this limitation, we propose SmoothCLAP, which introduces softened targets derived from intra-modal similarity and paralinguistic features. By combining these softened targets with conventional contrastive supervision, SmoothCLAP learns embeddings that respect graded emotional relationships, while retaining the same inference pipeline as CLAP. Experiments on eight affective computing tasks across English and German demonstrate that SmoothCLAP is consistently achieving superior performance. Our results highlight that leveraging soft supervision is a promising strategy for building emotion-aware audio-text models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12591v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Blurred Drinker Paradoxes and Blurred Choice Axioms: Constructive Reverse Mathematics of the Downward L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12592</link><description>arXiv:2601.12592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting of constructive reverse mathematics, we analyse the downward L\"owenheim-Skolem (DLS) theorem of first-order logic, stating that every infinite model has a countable elementary submodel. Refining the well-known equivalence of the DLS theorem to the axiom of dependent choice (DC) over classical base theories, our constructive approach allows for several finer logical decompositions: Just assuming countable choice (CC), the DLS theorem is equivalent to the conjunction of DC with a newly identified fragment of the excluded middle (LEM) that we call the blurred drinker paradox (BDP). Further without CC, the DLS theorem is equivalent to the conjunction of BDP with similarly blurred weakenings of DC and CC. Independently of their connection with the DLS theorem, we also study BDP and the blurred choice axioms on their own, for instance by showing that BDP is LEM without a contribution of Markov's principle and that blurred DC is DC without a contribution of CC.

Abstract: Individuals experiencing interpersonal violence (IPV), who depend on medical devices, represent a uniquely vulnerable population as healthcare technologies become increasingly connected. Despite rapid growth in MedTech innovation and "health-at-home" ecosystems, the intersection of MedTech cybersecurity and technology-facilitated abuse remains critically under-examined. IPV survivors who rely on therapeutic devices encounter a qualitatively different threat environment from the external, technically sophisticated adversaries typically modeled in MedTech cybersecurity research. We address this gap through two complementary methods: (1) the development of hazard-integrated threat models that fuse Cyber physical system security modeling with tech-abuse frameworks, and (2) an immersive simulation with practitioners, deploying a live version of our model, identifying gaps in digital forensic practice.
  Our hazard-integrated CIA threat models map exploits to acute and chronic biological effects, uncovering (i) Integrity attack pathways that facilitate "Medical gaslighting" and "Munchausen-by-IoMT", (ii) Availability attacks that create life-critical and sub-acute harms (glycaemic emergencies, blindness, mood destabilization), and (iii) Confidentiality threats arising from MedTech advertisements (geolocation tracking from BLE broadcasts). Our simulation demonstrates that these attack surfaces are unlikely to be detected in practice: participants overlooked MedTech, misclassified reproductive and assistive technologies, and lacked awareness of BLE broadcast artifacts. Our findings show that MedTech cybersecurity in IPV contexts requires integrated threat modeling and improved forensic capabilities for detecting, preserving and interpreting harms arising from compromised patient-technology ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12593v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dissecting Linear Recurrent Models: How Different Gating Strategies Drive Selectivity and Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12598</link><description>arXiv:2601.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks have emerged as efficient alternatives to the original Transformer's softmax attention mechanism, thanks to their highly parallelizable training and constant memory and computation requirements at inference. Iterative refinements of these models have introduced an increasing number of architectural mechanisms, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Nevertheless, systematic direct comparisons among these models remain limited. Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a scalable approach for adapting large speech foundation models to new domains. While methods such as LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants reduce adaptation costs, they typically allocate parameters uniformly across model subspaces, which limits their efficiency and scalability in speech applications. Building on our prior work, this paper introduces SSVD-Outer (SSVD-O), an extension of the structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning method. SSVD-O combines input acoustic feature space-associated inner transformations with output semantic feature space-associated outer transformations to enable scalable and balanced adaptation. We conduct the first systematic analysis of parameter budget allocation across model subspaces in PEFT for automatic speech recognition (ASR), and investigate the trade-off between learning and forgetting under constrained resources. SSVD-O is benchmarked against LoRA, DoRA, PiSSA, and SSVD on domain-shifted ASR tasks, including child speech and regional accents, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B within the ESPnet framework. Experimental results show that SSVD-O consistently narrows the performance gap to full fine-tuning while improving generalization and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Softmax and Entropy: Improving Convergence Guarantees of Policy Gradients by f-SoftArgmax Parameterization with Coupled Regularization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12604</link><description>arXiv:2601.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods are known to be highly sensitive to the choice of policy parameterization. In particular, the widely used softmax parameterization can induce ill-conditioned optimization landscapes and lead to exponentially slow convergence. Although this can be mitigated by preconditioning, this solution is often computationally expensive. Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning. We also derive sample-complexity bounds for the unregularized problem and show that f-PG, with Tsallis divergences achieves polynomial sample complexity in contrast to the exponential complexity incurred by the standard softmax parameterization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12604v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explicit Almost-Optimal $\varepsilon$-Balanced Codes via Free Expander Walks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12606</link><description>arXiv:2601.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of constructing explicit codes whose rate and distance match the Gilbert-Varshamov bound in the low-rate, high-distance regime. In 2017, Ta-Shma gave an explicit family of codes where every pair of codewords has relative distance $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$, with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon^{2+o(1)})$, matching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound up to a factor of $\varepsilon^{o(1)}$. Ta-Shma's construction was based on starting with a good code and amplifying its bias with walks arising from the $s$-wide-replacement product.
  In this work, we give an arguably simpler almost-optimal construction, based on what we call free expander walks: ordinary expander walks where each step is taken on a distinct expander from a carefully chosen sequence. This sequence of expanders is derived from the construction of near-$X$-Ramanujan graphs due to O'Donnell and Wu.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12606v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Cloud-based Multi-Agentic Workflow for Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12607</link><description>arXiv:2601.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become ubiquitous across various scientific domains, their lack of ability to perform complex tasks like running simulations or to make complex decisions limits their utility. LLM-based agents bridge this gap due to their ability to call external resources and tools and thus are now rapidly gaining popularity. However, coming up with a workflow that can balance the models, cloud providers, and external resources is very challenging, making implementing an agentic system more of a hindrance than a help. In this work, we present a domain-agnostic, model-independent workflow for an agentic framework that can act as a scientific assistant while being run entirely on cloud. Built with a supervisor agent marshaling an array of agents with individual capabilities, our framework brings together straightforward tasks like literature review and data analysis with more complex ones like simulation runs. We describe the framework here in full, including a proof-of-concept system we built to accelerate the study of Catalysts, which is highly important in the field of Chemistry and Material Science. We report the cost to operate and use this framework, including the breakdown of the cost by services use. We also evaluate our system on a custom-curated synthetic benchmark and a popular Chemistry benchmark, and also perform expert validation of the system. The results show that our system is able to route the task to the correct agent 90% of the time and successfully complete the assigned task 97.5% of the time for the synthetic tasks and 91% of the time for real-world tasks, while still achieving better or comparable accuracy to most frontier models, showing that this is a viable framework for other scientific domains to replicate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12607v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HERMES: A Unified Open-Source Framework for Realtime Multimodal Physiological Sensing, Edge AI, and Intervention in Closed-Loop Smart Healthcare Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12610</link><description>arXiv:2601.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent assistive technologies are increasingly recognized as critical daily-use enablers for people with disabilities and age-related functional decline. Longitudinal studies, curation of quality datasets, live monitoring in activities of daily living, and intelligent intervention devices, share the largely unsolved need in reliable high-throughput multimodal sensing and processing. Streaming large heterogeneous data from distributed sensors, historically closed-source environments, and limited prior works on realtime closed-loop AI methodologies, inhibit such applications. To accelerate the emergence of clinical deployments, we deliver HERMES - an open-source high-performance Python framework for continuous multimodal sensing and AI processing at the edge. It enables synchronized data collection, and realtime streaming inference with user PyTorch models, on commodity computing devices. HERMES is applicable to fixed-lab and free-living environments, of distributed commercial and custom sensors. It is the first work to offer a holistic methodology that bridges cross-disciplinary gaps in real-world implementation strategies, and guides downstream AI model development. Its application on the closed-loop intelligent prosthesis use case illustrates the process of suitable AI model development from the generated constraints and trade-offs. Validation on the use case, with 4 synchronized hosts cooperatively capturing 18 wearable and off-body modalities, demonstrates performance and relevance of HERMES to the trajectory of the intelligent healthcare domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12610v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Trace Powers Reveal About Log-Determinants: Closed-Form Estimators, Certificates, and Failure Modes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12612</link><description>arXiv:2601.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing $\log\det(A)$ for large symmetric positive definite matrices arises in Gaussian process inference and Bayesian model comparison. Standard methods combine matrix-vector products with polynomial approximations. We study a different model: access to trace powers $p_k = \tr(A^k)$, natural when matrix powers are available.
  Classical moment-based approximations Taylor-expand $\log(\lambda)$ around the arithmetic mean. This requires $|\lambda - \AM| &lt; \AM$ and diverges when $\kappa &gt; 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = \lambda/\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \E[\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\log\det(A) = n(\log \AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.
  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \E[\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\det A)^{1/n}$. Given a spectral floor $r \leq \lambda_{\min}$, we obtain moment-constrained lower bounds, yielding a provable interval for $\log\det(A)$. A gap diagnostic indicates when to trust the point estimate and when to report bounds. All estimators and bounds cost $O(m)$, independent of $n$. For $m \in \{4, \ldots, 8\}$, this is effectively constant time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12612v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Allocating Corrective Control to Mitigate Multi-agent Safety Violations Under Private Preferences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12616</link><description>arXiv:2601.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework that computes the corrective control efforts to ensure joint safety in multi-agent dynamical systems. This framework efficiently distributes the required corrective effort without revealing individual agents' private preferences. Our framework integrates high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs), which enforce safety constraints with formal guarantees of safety for complex dynamical systems, with a privacy-preserving resource allocation mechanism based on the progressive second price (PSP) auction. When a joint safety constraint is violated, agents iteratively bid on new corrective efforts via 'avoidance credits' rather than explicitly solving for feasible corrective efforts that remove the safety violation. The resulting correction, determined via a second price payment rule, coincides with the socially optimal safe distribution of corrective actions. Critically, the bidding process achieves this optimal allocation efficiently and without revealing private preferences of individual agents. We demonstrate this method through multi-robot hardware experiments on the Robotarium platform.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12616v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Creating Disability Story Videos with Generative AI: Motivation, Expression, and Sharing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12617</link><description>arXiv:2601.12617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is both promising and challenging in supporting people with disabilities (PwDs) in creating stories about disability. GenAI can reduce barriers to media production and inspire the creativity of PwDs, but it may also introduce biases and imperfections that hinder its adoption for personal expression. In this research, we examine how nine PwD from a disability advocacy group used GenAI to create videos sharing their disability experiences. Grounded in digital storytelling theory, we explore the motivations, expression, and sharing of PwD-created GenAI story videos. We conclude with a framework of momentous depiction, which highlights four core affordances of GenAI that either facilitate or require improvements to better support disability storytelling: non-capturable depiction, identity concealment and representation, contextual realism and consistency, and emotional articulation. Based on this framework, we further discuss design implications for GenAI in relation to story completion, media formats, and corrective mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12617v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Disagreement as Data: Reasoning Trace Analytics in Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12618</link><description>arXiv:2601.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning analytics researchers often analyze qualitative student data such as coded annotations or interview transcripts to understand learning processes. With the rise of generative AI, fully automated and human-AI workflows have emerged as promising methods for analysis. However, methodological standards to guide such workflows remain limited. In this study, we propose that reasoning traces generated by large language model (LLM) agents, especially within multi-agent systems, constitute a novel and rich form of process data to enhance interpretive practices in qualitative coding. We apply cosine similarity to LLM reasoning traces to systematically detect, quantify, and interpret disagreements among agents, reframing disagreement as a meaningful analytic signal. Analyzing nearly 10,000 instances of agent pairs coding human tutoring dialog segments, we show that LLM agents' semantic reasoning similarity robustly differentiates consensus from disagreement and correlates with human coding reliability. Qualitative analysis guided by this metric reveals nuanced instructional sub-functions within codes and opportunities for conceptual codebook refinement. By integrating quantitative similarity metrics with qualitative review, our method has the potential to improve and accelerate establishing inter-rater reliability during coding by surfacing interpretive ambiguity, especially when LLMs collaborate with humans. We discuss how reasoning-trace disagreements represent a valuable new class of analytic signals advancing methodological rigor and interpretive depth in educational research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12618v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Deterministic Finite-State Machines from the Prefixes of a Single String is NP-Complete</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12621</link><description>arXiv:2601.12621v1 Announce Type: new

Previous work has identified conditions on the input sample under which the problem becomes tractable or remains hard. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of the case where the input sample is prefix-closed. This formulation is equivalent to computing a minimum Moore machine consistent with observations along its runs. We show that the problem is NP-hard to approximate when the sample set consists of all prefixes of binary strings. Furthermore, we show that the problem remains NP-hard as a decision problem even when the sample set consists of the prefixes of a single binary string. Our argument also extends to the corresponding problem for Mealy machines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12621v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Robust Universal Perturbation Attacks: A Float-Coded, Penalty-Driven Evolutionary Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12624</link><description>arXiv:2601.12624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to undermine deep neural networks across multiple inputs using a single noise pattern. Evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to generating such perturbations due to their ability to navigate non-convex, gradient-free landscapes. In this work, we introduce a float-coded, penalty-driven single-objective evolutionary framework for UAP generation that achieves lower visibility perturbations while enhancing attack success rates. Our approach leverages continuous gene representations aligned with contemporary deep learning scales, incorporates dynamic evolutionary operators with adaptive scheduling, and utilizes a modular PyTorch implementation for seamless integration with modern architectures. Additionally, we ensure the universality of the generated perturbations by testing across diverse models and by periodically switching batches to prevent overfitting. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently produces perturbations with smaller norms, higher misclassification effectiveness, and faster convergence compared to existing evolutionary-based methods. These findings highlight the robustness and scalability of our approach for universal adversarial attacks across various deep learning architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12624v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Resilient Interval Observer-Based Control for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control under FDI Attack</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12625</link><description>arXiv:2601.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectivity in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) introduces vulnerability to cyber threats such as false data injection (FDI) attacks, which can compromise system reliability and safety. To ensure resilience, this paper proposes a control framework combining a nonlinear controller with an interval observer for robust state estimation under measurement noise. The observer bounds leader's states, while a neural network-based estimator estimates the unknown FDI attacks in real time. These estimates are then used to mitigate FDI attack effects maintaining safe inter-vehicle spacing. The proposed approach leverages an idea of interval observer-based estimation and merges model-based and learning-based methods to achieve accurate estimations and real-time performance. MATLAB/Simulink results confirm resilient tracking, precise FDI attack estimation, and robustness to noise, demonstrating potential for real-world CACC applications under cyberattacks, disturbance, and bounded measurement noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12625v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Linear Mechanisms for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Vision Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12626</link><description>arXiv:2601.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal reasoning is a remarkable capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs), but the underlying mechanisms of such abilities remain largely opaque. We postulate that visual/geometrical and textual representations of spatial structure must be combined at some point in VLM computations. We search for such confluence, and ask whether the identified representation can causally explain aspects of input-output model behavior through a linear model. We show empirically that VLMs encode object locations by linearly binding \textit{spatial IDs} to textual activations, then perform reasoning via language tokens. Through rigorous causal interventions we demonstrate that these IDs, which are ubiquitous across the model, can systematically mediate model beliefs at intermediate VLM layers. Additionally, we find that spatial IDs serve as a diagnostic tool for identifying limitations in existing VLMs, and as a valuable learning signal. We extend our analysis to video VLMs and identify an analogous linear temporal ID mechanism. By characterizing our proposed spatiotemporal ID mechanism, we elucidate a previously underexplored internal reasoning process in VLMs, toward improved interpretability and the principled design of more aligned and capable models.

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) provides a powerful framework for exploring how individual behaviors and interactions give rise to collective social dynamics. However, most ABMs rely on handcrafted or parameterized agent rules that are not empirically grounded, thereby limiting their realism and validation against observed data. To address this gap, we constructed a large-scale, empirically grounded dataset from Reddit to support the development and evaluation of agent-based social simulations. The dataset includes 33 technology-focused, 14 climate-focused, and 7 COVID-related aggregated agents, encompassing around one million posts and comments. Using publicly available posts and comments, we define agent categories based on content and interaction patterns, derive inter-agent relationships from temporal commenting behaviors, and build a directed, weighted network that reflects empirically observed user connections. The resulting dataset enables researchers to calibrate and benchmark agent behavior, network structure, and information diffusion processes against real social dynamics. Our quantitative analysis reveals clear topic-dependent differences in how users interact. Climate discussions show dense, highly connected networks with sustained engagement, COVID-related interactions are sparse and mostly one-directional, and technology discussions are organized around a small number of central hubs. Manual qualitative analysis further shows that agent interactions follow realistic patterns of timing, similarity between users, and sentiment change.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12628v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BioPulse-QA: A Dynamic Biomedical Question-Answering Benchmark for Evaluating Factuality, Robustness, and Bias in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12632</link><description>arXiv:2601.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical settings, and existing benchmark datasets have played an important role in supporting model development and evaluation. However, these benchmarks often have limitations. Many rely on static or outdated datasets that fail to capture the dynamic, context-rich, and high-stakes nature of biomedical knowledge. They also carry increasing risk of data leakage due to overlap with model pretraining corpora and often overlook critical dimensions such as robustness to linguistic variation and potential demographic biases.
  Materials and Methods: To address these gaps, we introduce BioPulse-QA, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on answering questions from newly published biomedical documents including drug labels, trial protocols, and clinical guidelines. BioPulse-QA includes 2,280 expert-verified question answering (QA) pairs and perturbed variants, covering both extractive and abstractive formats. We evaluate four LLMs - GPT-4o, GPT-o1, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct - released prior to the publication dates of the benchmark documents.
  Results: GPT-o1 achieves the highest relaxed F1 score (0.92), followed by Gemini-2.0-Flash (0.90) on drug labels. Clinical trials are the most challenging source, with extractive F1 scores as low as 0.36.
  Discussion and Conclusion: Performance differences are larger for paraphrasing than for typographical errors, while bias testing shows negligible differences. BioPulse-QA provides a scalable and clinically relevant framework for evaluating biomedical LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12632v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Cost of Convenience: Identifying, Analyzing, and Mitigating Predatory Loan Applications on Android</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12634</link><description>arXiv:2601.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital lending applications, commonly referred to as loan apps, have become a primary channel for microcredit in emerging markets. However, many of these apps demand excessive permissions and misuse sensitive user data for coercive debt-recovery practices, including harassment, blackmail, and public shaming that affect both borrowers and their contacts.
  This paper presents the first cross-country measurement of loan app compliance against both national regulations and Google's Financial Services Policy. We analyze 434 apps drawn from official registries and app markets from Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines. To operationalize policy requirements at scale, we translate policy text into testable permission checks using LLM-assisted policy-to-permission mapping and combine this with static and dynamic analyses of loan apps' code and runtime behavior.
  Our findings reveal pervasive non-compliance among approved apps: 141 violate national regulatory policy and 147 violate Google policy. Dynamic analysis further shows that several apps transmit sensitive data (contacts, SMS, location, media) before user signup or registration, undermining informed consent and enabling downstream harassment of borrowers and third parties. Following our disclosures, Google removed 93 flagged apps from Google Play, representing over 300M cumulative installs.
  We advocate for adopting our methodology as a proactive compliance-monitoring tool and offer targeted recommendations for regulators, platforms, and developers to strengthen privacy protections. Overall, our results highlight the need for coordinated enforcement and robust technical safeguards to ensure that digital lending supports financial inclusion without compromising user privacy or safety.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12634v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Bands to Depth: Understanding Bathymetry Decisions on Sentinel-2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12636</link><description>arXiv:2601.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Sentinel-2 satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) robustly across sites remains challenging. We analyze a Swin-Transformer based U-Net model (Swin-BathyUNet) to understand how it infers depth and when its predictions are trustworthy. A leave-one-band out study ranks spectral importance to the different bands consistent with shallow water optics. We adapt ablation-based CAM to regression (A-CAM-R) and validate the reliability via a performance retention test: keeping only the top-p% salient pixels while neutralizing the rest causes large, monotonic RMSE increase, indicating explanations localize on evidence the model relies on. Attention ablations show decoder conditioned cross attention on skips is an effective upgrade, improving robustness to glint/foam. Cross-region inference (train on one site, test on another) reveals depth-dependent degradation: MAE rises nearly linearly with depth, and bimodal depth distributions exacerbate mid/deep errors. Practical guidance follows: maintain wide receptive fields, preserve radiometric fidelity in green/blue channels, pre-filter bright high variance near shore, and pair light target site fine tuning with depth aware calibration to transfer across regions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12636v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Topology-Aware Multiscale Mixture of Experts for Efficient Molecular Property Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12637</link><description>arXiv:2601.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many molecular properties depend on 3D geometry, where non-covalent interactions, stereochemical effects, and medium- to long-range forces are determined by spatial distances and angles that cannot be uniquely captured by a 2D bond graph. Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks. These results highlight topology-aware multiscale routing as an effective principle for 3D molecular graph learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12637v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mixed Precision PointPillars for Efficient 3D Object Detection with TensorRT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12638</link><description>arXiv:2601.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LIDAR 3D object detection is one of the important tasks for autonomous vehicles. Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our models offer less latency and sizes by up to 2.35 and 2.26 times, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12638v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Objective Matters: Fine-Tuning Objectives Shape Safety, Robustness, and Persona Drift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12639</link><description>arXiv:2601.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs on benign data can still degrade alignment and adversarial robustness, yet direct analysis of the role of fine-tuning objectives in shaping these safety outcomes remain limited. We present a controlled comparison of six fine-tuning objectives -- Supervised Fine-Tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, Conditional Fine-Tuning, Inoculation Prompting, Odds Ratio Preference Optimization, and KL-regularized fine-tuning -- holding data, domain, architecture, and optimization fixed. Across closed-form reasoning and open-ended generation tasks, we find that objective choice induces systematic, scale-dependent shifts along the safety-capability frontier. At small training budgets, robustness is similar across objectives but capability differs. At larger budgets, objectives diverge sharply: supervised and preference-based tuning tightly couple capability gains to increased adversarial vulnerability and persona drift, while objectives that constrain learning signals -- especially ORPO and KL-regularization -- substantially mitigate both. Fine-tuning objectives therefore matter little for safety at small scales but become a primary driver of adversarial robustness and latent persona stability as training scale increases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12639v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Identification: Computing Boolean Functions via Channels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12640</link><description>arXiv:2601.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a point-to-point communication system in which the transmitter holds a binary message of length $m$ and transmits a corresponding codeword of length $n$. The receiver's goal is to recover a Boolean function of that message, where the function is unknown to the transmitter, but chosen from a known class $F$. We are interested in the asymptotic relationship of $m$ and $n$: given $n$, how large can $m$ be (asymptotically), such that the value of the Boolean function can be recovered reliably? This problem generalizes the identification-via-channels framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. We formulate the notion of computation capacity, and derive achievability and converse results for selected classes of functions $F$, characterized by the Hamming weight of functions. Our obtained results are tight in the sense of the scaling behavior for all cases of $F$ considered in the paper.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12640v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STEP-LLM: Generating CAD STEP Models from Natural Language with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12641</link><description>arXiv:2601.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is vital to modern manufacturing, yet model creation remains labor-intensive and expertise-heavy. To enable non-experts to translate intuitive design intent into manufacturable artifacts, recent large language models-based text-to-CAD efforts focus on command sequences or script-based formats like CadQuery. However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ~40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought(CoT)-style structural annotations that guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning, and refine generation quality through reinforcement learning with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL further reduces geometric discrepancy. Both metrics and visual comparisons confirm that STEP-LLM generates shapes with higher fidelity than Text2CAD. These results show the feasibility of LLM-driven STEP model generation from natural language, showing its potential to democratize CAD design for manufacturing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Intelligent Documentation in Medical Education: Can AI Replace Manual Case Logging?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12648</link><description>arXiv:2601.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procedural case logs are a core requirement in radiology training, yet they are time-consuming to complete and prone to inconsistency when authored manually. This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can automate procedural case log documentation directly from free-text radiology reports. We evaluate multiple local and commercial LLMs under instruction-based and chain-of-thought prompting to extract structured procedural information from 414 curated interventional radiology reports authored by nine residents between 2018 and 2024. Model performance is assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score, alongside inference latency and token efficiency to estimate operational cost. Results show that both local and commercial models achieve strong extraction performance, with best F1-scores approaching 0.87, while exhibiting different trade-offs between speed and cost. Automation using LLMs has the potential to substantially reduce clerical burden for trainees and improve consistency in case logging. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of AI-assisted documentation in medical education and highlight the need for further validation across institutions and clinical workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12648v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ethical Risks in Deploying Large Language Models: An Evaluation of Medical Ethics Jailbreaking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12652</link><description>arXiv:2601.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption, malicious prompt engineering specifically "jailbreak attacks" poses severe security risks by inducing models to bypass internal safety mechanisms. Current benchmarks predominantly focus on public safety and Western cultural norms, leaving a critical gap in evaluating the niche, high-risk domain of medical ethics within the Chinese context. Objective: To establish a specialized jailbreak evaluation framework for Chinese medical ethics and to systematically assess the defensive resilience and ethical alignment of seven prominent LLMs when subjected to sophisticated adversarial simulations. Methodology: We evaluated seven prominent models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4-Reasoning, DeepSeek-R1) using a "role-playing + scenario simulation + multi-turn dialogue" vector within the DeepInception framework. The testing focused on eight high-risk themes, including commercial surrogacy and organ trading, utilizing a hierarchical scoring matrix to quantify the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and ASR Gain. Results: A systemic collapse of defenses was observed, whereas models demonstrated high baseline compliance, the jailbreak ASR reached 82.1%, representing an ASR Gain of over 80 percentage points. Claude-Sonnet-4-Reasoning emerged as the most robust model, while five models including Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-4.1 exhibited near-total failure with ASRs between 96% and 100%. Conclusions: Current LLMs are highly vulnerable to contextual manipulation in medical ethics, often prioritizing "helpfulness" over safety constraints. To enhance security, we recommend a transition from outcome to process supervision, the implementation of multi-factor identity verification, and the establishment of cross-model "joint defense" mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12652v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explanation Multiplicity in SHAP: Characterization and Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12654</link><description>arXiv:2601.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-hoc explanations are widely used to justify, contest, and audit automated decisions in high-stakes domains. SHAP, in particular, is often treated as a reliable account of which features drove an individual prediction. Yet SHAP explanations can vary substantially across repeated runs even when the input, task, and trained model are held fixed. We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Enhancing Resilience of Microgrids under Extreme Weather Events</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12657</link><description>arXiv:2601.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid resilience is crucial in light of power interruptions caused by increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Well-designed energy management systems (EMS) have made progress in improving microgrid resilience through the coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs), but still face significant challenges in addressing the uncertainty of load demand caused by extreme weather. The integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into EMS design enables optimized microgrid control strategies for coordinating DERs. Building on this, we proposed a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based EMS framework to provide flexible scalability for microgrids, enhance resilience and reduce operational costs during power outages. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit with a gating mechanism was introduced to extract features from temporal data, which enables the EMS to coordinate DERs more efficiently. Next, the proposed MADRL method incorporating action masking techniques was evaluated in the IEEE 33-Bus system using real-world data on renewable generation and power load. Finally, the numerical results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in reducing operating costs as well as the effectiveness in enhancing microgrid resilience during power interruptions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12657v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Augmenting Question Answering with A Hybrid RAG Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12658</link><description>arXiv:2601.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the quality of responses in Question-Answering (QA) tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with retrieving contextually relevant information, leading to incomplete or suboptimal answers. In this paper, we introduce Structured-Semantic RAG (SSRAG), a hybrid architecture that enhances QA quality by integrating query augmentation, agentic routing, and a structured retrieval mechanism combining vector and graph based techniques with context unification. By refining retrieval processes and improving contextual grounding, our approach improves both answer accuracy and informativeness. We conduct extensive evaluations on three popular QA datasets, TruthfulQA, SQuAD and WikiQA, across five Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that our proposed approach consistently improves response quality over standard RAG implementations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12658v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Faithful Explanations in Acoustic Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12660</link><description>arXiv:2601.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability is essential for user trust in real-world anomaly detection applications. However, deep learning models, despite their strong performance, often lack transparency. In this work, we study the interpretability of autoencoder-based models for audio anomaly detection, by comparing a standard autoencoder (AE) with a mask autoencoder (MAE) in terms of detection performance and interpretability. We applied several attribution methods, including error maps, saliency maps, SmoothGrad, Integrated Gradients, GradSHAP, and Grad-CAM. Although MAE shows a slightly lower detection, it consistently provides more faithful and temporally precise explanations, suggesting a better alignment with true anomalies. To assess the relevance of the regions highlighted by the explanation method, we propose a perturbation-based faithfulness metric that replaces them with their reconstructions to simulate normal input. Our findings, based on experiments in a real industrial scenario, highlight the importance of incorporating interpretability into anomaly detection pipelines and show that masked training improves explanation quality without compromising performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12660v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedConsultBench: A Full-Cycle, Fine-Grained, Process-Aware Benchmark for Medical Consultation Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12661</link><description>arXiv:2601.12661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluations of medical consultation agents often prioritize outcome-oriented tasks, frequently overlooking the end-to-end process integrity and clinical safety essential for real-world practice. While recent interactive benchmarks have introduced dynamic scenarios, they often remain fragmented and coarse-grained, failing to capture the structured inquiry logic and diagnostic rigor required in professional consultations. To bridge this gap, we propose MedConsultBench, a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate the complete online consultation cycle by covering the entire clinical workflow from history taking and diagnosis to treatment planning and follow-up Q\&amp;amp;A. Our methodology introduces Atomic Information Units (AIUs) to track clinical information acquisition at a sub-turn level, enabling precise monitoring of how key facts are elicited through 22 fine-grained metrics. By addressing the underspecification and ambiguity inherent in online consultations, the benchmark evaluates uncertainty-aware yet concise inquiry while emphasizing medication regimen compatibility and the ability to handle realistic post-prescription follow-up Q\&amp;amp;A via constraint-respecting plan revisions. Systematic evaluation of 19 large language models reveals that high diagnostic accuracy often masks significant deficiencies in information-gathering efficiency and medication safety. These results underscore a critical gap between theoretical medical knowledge and clinical practice ability, establishing MedConsultBench as a rigorous foundation for aligning medical AI with the nuanced requirements of real-world clinical care.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12661v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12662</link><description>arXiv:2601.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in dynamic yet structurally similar multi-hop wireless networks. Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalizable Hyperparameter Optimization for Federated Learning on Non-IID Cancer Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12664</link><description>arXiv:2601.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning for cancer histopathology training conflicts with privacy constraints in clinical settings. Federated Learning (FL) mitigates this by keeping data local; however, its performance depends on hyperparameter choices under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) client datasets. This paper examined whether hyperparameters optimized on one cancer imaging dataset generalized across non-IID federated scenarios. We considered binary histopathology tasks for ovarian and colorectal cancers. We perform centralized Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and transfer dataset-specific optima to the non-IID FL setup. The main contribution of this study is the introduction of a simple cross-dataset aggregation heuristic by combining configurations by averaging the learning rates and considering the modal optimizers and batch sizes. This combined configuration achieves a competitive classification performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12664v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Near-Light Color Photometric Stereo for mono-Chromaticity non-lambertian surface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12666</link><description>arXiv:2601.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color photometric stereo enables single-shot surface reconstruction, extending conventional photometric stereo that requires multiple images of a static scene under varying illumination to dynamic scenarios. However, most existing approaches assume ideal distant lighting and Lambertian reflectance, leaving more practical near-light conditions and non-Lambertian surfaces underexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that leverages neural implicit representations for depth and BRDF modeling under the assumption of mono-chromaticity (uniform chromaticity and homogeneous material), which alleviates the inherent ill-posedness of color photometric stereo and allows for detailed surface recovery from just one image. Furthermore, we design a compact optical tactile sensor to validate our approach. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust surface reconstruction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12666v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Empowering All-in-Loop Health Management of Spacecraft Power System in the Mega-Constellation Era via Human-AI Collaboration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12667</link><description>arXiv:2601.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is foreseeable that the number of spacecraft will increase exponentially, ushering in an era dominated by satellite mega-constellations (SMC). This necessitates a focus on energy in space: spacecraft power systems (SPS), especially their health management (HM), given their role in power supply and high failure rates. Providing health management for dozens of SPS and for thousands of SPS represents two fundamentally different paradigms. Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that SpaceHMchat achieves excellent performance across 23 quantitative metrics, such as 100% conclusion accuracy in logical reasoning of work condition recognition, over 99% success rate in anomaly detection tool invocation, over 90% precision in fault localization, and knowledge base search time under 3 minutes in maintenance decision-making. Another contribution of this work is the release of the first-ever AIL HM dataset of SPS. This dataset contains four sub-datasets, involving 4 types of AIL HM sub-tasks, 17 types of faults, and over 700,000 timestamps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12667v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploiting Test-Time Augmentation in Federated Learning for Brain Tumor MRI Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12671</link><description>arXiv:2601.12671v1 Announce Type: new

In practice, TTA should be the default inference strategy in FL-based medical imaging; when the computational budget permits, pairing TTA with light preprocessing provides additional reliable gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12671v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VILTA: A VLM-in-the-Loop Adversary for Enhancing Driving Policy Robustness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12672</link><description>arXiv:2601.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous driving (AD) systems is fundamentally hindered by the long-tail problem, where rare yet critical driving scenarios are severely underrepresented in real-world data. Existing solutions including safety-critical scenario generation and closed-loop learning often rely on rule-based heuristics, resampling methods and generative models learned from offline datasets, limiting their ability to produce diverse and novel challenges. While recent works leverage Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce scene descriptions that guide a separate, downstream model in generating hazardous trajectories for agents, such two-stage framework constrains the generative potential of VLMs, as the diversity of the final trajectories is ultimately limited by the generalization ceiling of the downstream algorithm. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VILTA (VLM-In-the-Loop Trajectory Adversary), a novel framework that integrates a VLM into the closed-loop training of AD agents. Unlike prior works, VILTA actively participates in the training loop by comprehending the dynamic driving environment and strategically generating challenging scenarios through direct, fine-grained editing of surrounding agents' future trajectories. This direct-editing approach fully leverages the VLM's powerful generalization capabilities to create a diverse curriculum of plausible yet challenging scenarios that extend beyond the scope of traditional methods. We demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the safety and robustness of the resulting AD policy, particularly in its ability to navigate critical long-tail events.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12672v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics-informed machine learning for reconstruction of dynamical systems with invariant measure score matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12675</link><description>arXiv:2601.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel mesh-free framework, termed physics-informed neural networks with invariant measure score matching (PINN-IMSM), for reconstructing dynamical systems from unlabeled point-cloud data that capture the system's invariant measure. The invariant density satisfies the steady-state Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. We reformulate this equation in terms of its score function (the gradient of the log-density), which is estimated directly from data via denoising score matching, thereby bypassing explicit density estimation. This learned score is then embedded into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct the drift velocity field under the resulting score-based FP equation. The mesh-free nature of PINNs allows the framework to scale to higher dimensions, avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in mesh-based methods. To address the ill-posedness of high-dimensional inverse problems, we recast the problem as a PDE-constrained optimization that seeks the minimal-energy velocity field. Under suitable conditions, we prove that this problem admits a unique solution that depends continuously on the score function. The constrained formulation is solved using a stochastic augmented Lagrangian method. Numerical experiments on representative dynamical systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, an active swimmer in an anharmonic trap, and the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 systems, demonstrate that PINN-IMSM accurately recovers invariant measures and reconstructs faithful dynamical behavior for problems in up to five dimensions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12675v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MetaToolAgent: Towards Generalizable Tool Usage in LLMs through Meta-Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12680</link><description>arXiv:2601.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool learning is increasingly important for large language models (LLMs) to effectively coordinate and utilize a diverse set of tools in order to solve complex real-world tasks. By selecting and integrating appropriate tools, LLMs extend their capabilities beyond pure language understanding to perform specialized functions. However, existing methods for tool selection often focus on limited tool sets and struggle to generalize to novel tools encountered in practical deployments. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 domains, containing 155 tools and 9,377 question-answer pairs, which simulates realistic integration scenarios. Additionally, we propose MetaToolAgent (MTA), a meta-learning approach designed to improve cross-tool generalization. Experimental results show that MTA significantly outperforms baseline methods on unseen tools, demonstrating its promise for building flexible and scalable systems that require dynamic tool coordination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HyFormer: Revisiting the Roles of Sequence Modeling and Feature Interaction in CTR Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12681</link><description>arXiv:2601.12681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial large-scale recommendation models (LRMs) face the challenge of jointly modeling long-range user behavior sequences and heterogeneous non-sequential features under strict efficiency constraints. However, most existing architectures employ a decoupled pipeline: long sequences are first compressed with a query-token based sequence compressor like LONGER, followed by fusion with dense features through token-mixing modules like RankMixer, which thereby limits both the representation capacity and the interaction flexibility. This paper presents HyFormer, a unified hybrid transformer architecture that tightly integrates long-sequence modeling and feature interaction into a single backbone. From the perspective of sequence modeling, we revisit and redesign query tokens in LRMs, and frame the LRM modeling task as an alternating optimization process that integrates two core components: Query Decoding which expands non-sequential features into Global Tokens and performs long sequence decoding over layer-wise key-value representations of long behavioral sequences; and Query Boosting which enhances cross-query and cross-sequence heterogeneous interactions via efficient token mixing. The two complementary mechanisms are performed iteratively to refine semantic representations across layers. Extensive experiments on billion-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that HyFormer consistently outperforms strong LONGER and RankMixer baselines under comparable parameter and FLOPs budgets, while exhibiting superior scaling behavior with increasing parameters and FLOPs. Large-scale online A/B tests in high-traffic production systems further validate its effectiveness, showing significant gains over deployed state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: In the deformation measurement of high-temperature structures, image degradation caused by thermal radiation and random errors introduced by heat haze restrict the accuracy and effectiveness of deformation measurement. To suppress thermal radiation and heat haze using fusion-restoration image processing methods, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of DIC in the measurement of high-temperature deformation. For image degradation caused by thermal radiation, based on the image layered representation, the image is decomposed into positive and negative channels for parallel processing, and then optimized for quality by multi-exposure image fusion. To counteract the high-frequency, random errors introduced by heat haze, we adopt the FSIM as the objective function to guide the iterative optimization of model parameters, and the grayscale average algorithm is applied to equalize anomalous gray values, thereby reducing measurement error. The proposed multi-exposure image fusion algorithm effectively suppresses image degradation caused by complex illumination conditions, boosting the effective computation area from 26% to 50% for under-exposed images and from 32% to 40% for over-exposed images without degrading measurement accuracy in the experiment. Meanwhile, the image restoration combined with the grayscale average algorithm reduces static thermal deformation measurement errors. The error in {\epsilon}_xx is reduced by 85.3%, while the errors in {\epsilon}_yy and {\gamma}_xy are reduced by 36.0% and 36.4%, respectively. We present image processing methods to suppress the interference of thermal radiation and heat haze in high-temperature deformation measurement using DIC. The experimental results verify that the proposed method can effectively improve image quality, reduce deformation measurement errors, and has potential application value in thermal deformation measurement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12682v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GaussianTrimmer: Online Trimming Boundaries for 3DGS Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12683</link><description>arXiv:2601.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread application of 3D Gaussians in 3D scene representation, 3D scene segmentation methods based on 3D Gaussians have also gradually emerged. However, existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods basically segment on the basis of Gaussian primitives. Due to the large variation range of the scale of 3D Gaussians, large-sized Gaussians that often span the foreground and background lead to jagged boundaries of segmented objects. To this end, we propose an online boundary trimming method, GaussianTrimmer, which is an efficient and plug-and-play post-processing method capable of trimming coarse boundaries for existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods. Our method consists of two core steps: 1. Generating uniformly and well-covered virtual cameras; 2. Trimming Gaussian at the primitive level based on 2D segmentation results on virtual cameras. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method can improve the segmentation quality of existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods as a plug-and-play method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Persuasion in Online Conversations Is Associated with Alignment in Expressed Human Values</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12685</link><description>arXiv:2601.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online disagreements often fail to produce understanding, instead reinforcing existing positions or escalating conflict. Prior work on predictors of successful persuasion in online discourse has largely focused on surface features such as linguistic style or conversational structure, leaving open the role of underlying principles or concerns that participants bring to an interaction. In this paper, we investigate how the expression and alignment of human values in back-and-forth online discussions relate to persuasion. Using data from Reddit's ChangeMyView subreddit, where successful persuasion is explicitly signaled through the awarding of deltas, we analyze one-on-one exchanges and characterize participants' value expression by drawing from Schwartz's Refined Theory of Basic Human Values. We find that successful persuasion is associated with two complementary processes: pre-existing compatibility between participants' value priorities even before the exchange happens, and the emergence of value alignment over the course of a conversation. At the same time, successful persuasion does not depend on commenters making large departures from their typical value expression patterns. We discuss implications of our findings for the design of online social platforms that aim to support constructive engagement across disagreement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12685v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Logic-Guided Multistage Inference for Explainable Multidefendant Judgment Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12688</link><description>arXiv:2601.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crime disrupts societal stability, making law essential for balance. In multidefendant cases, assigning responsibility is complex and challenges fairness, requiring precise role differentiation. However, judicial phrasing often obscures the roles of the defendants, hindering effective AI-driven analyses. To address this issue, we incorporate sentencing logic into a pretrained Transformer encoder framework to enhance the intelligent assistance in multidefendant cases while ensuring legal interpretability. Within this framework an oriented masking mechanism clarifies roles and a comparative data construction strategy improves the model's sensitivity to culpability distinctions between principals and accomplices. Predicted guilt labels are further incorporated into a regression model through broadcasting, consolidating crime descriptions and court views. Our proposed masked multistage inference (MMSI) framework, evaluated on the custom IMLJP dataset for intentional injury cases, achieves significant accuracy improvements, outperforming baselines in role-based culpability differentiation. This work offers a robust solution for enhancing intelligent judicial systems, with publicly code available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12688v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Priority-Based Bandwidth Allocation in Network Slicing-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12689</link><description>arXiv:2601.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses joint admission control and per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation to maximize weighted sum-rate in network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems when aggregate quality-of-service (QoS) demand may exceed available bandwidth. Specifically, we optimize bandwidth allocation while satisfying heterogeneous QoS requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. We decompose it into two sub-problems and solve them via computationally efficient heuristics within a sequential framework. We propose (i) a hierarchical admission control scheme that selectively admits UEs under bandwidth scarcity, prioritizing URLLC to ensure latency-sensitive QoS compliance, and (ii) an iterative gradient-based bandwidth allocation scheme that transfers bandwidth across slices guided by marginal utility and reallocates resources within slices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal performance, deviating from a CVX-based benchmark by at most 2.2% in weighted sum-rate while reducing runtime by 99.7%, thereby enabling practical real-time deployment. Compared to a baseline round-robin scheme without admission control, the proposed approach achieves up to 1085% and 7% higher success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, by intentionally sacrificing sum-rate to guarantee QoS. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that the proposed solution adapts effectively to diverse eMBB/URLLC traffic compositions, maintaining 47-51% eMBB and 93-94% URLLC success rates across varying load scenarios, confirming its robustness for resource-constrained large-scale deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12689v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Are we writing an advice column for Spock here?"

Abstract: Autistic individuals sometimes disclose autism when asking LLMs for social advice, hoping for more personalized responses. However, they also recognize that these systems may reproduce stereotypes, raising uncertainty about the risks and benefits of disclosure. We conducted a mixed-methods study combining a large-scale LLM audit experiment with interviews involving 11 autistic participants. We developed a six-step pipeline operationalizing 12 documented autism stereotypes into decision-making scenarios framed as users requesting advice (e.g., "Should I do A or B?"). We generated 345,000 responses from six LLMs and measured how advice shifted when prompts disclosed autism versus when they did not. When autism was disclosed, LLMs disproportionately recommended avoiding stereotypically stressful situations, including social events, confrontations, new experiences, and romantic relationships. While some participants viewed this as affirming, others criticized it as infantilizing or undermining opportunities for growth. Our study illuminates how the intermingling of affirmation and stereotyping complicates the personalization of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12690v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BlocksecRT-DETR: Decentralized Privacy-Preserving and Token-Efficient Federated Transformer Learning for Secure Real-Time Object Detection in ITS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12693</link><description>arXiv:2601.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated real-time object detection using transformers in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) faces three major challenges: (1) missing-class non-IID data heterogeneity from geographically diverse traffic environments, (2) latency constraints on edge hardware for high-capacity transformer models, and (3) privacy and security risks from untrusted client updates and centralized aggregation. We propose BlockSecRT-DETR, a BLOCKchain-SECured Real-Time Object DEtection TRansformer framework for ITS that provides a decentralized, token-efficient, and privacy-preserving federated training solution using RT-DETR transformer, incorporating a blockchain-secured update validation mechanism for trustworthy aggregation. In this framework, challenges (1) and (2) are jointly addressed through a unified client-side design that integrates RT-DETR training with a Token Engineering Module (TEM). TEM prunes low-utility tokens, reducing encoder complexity and latency on edge hardware, while aggregated updates mitigate non-IID data heterogeneity across clients. To address challenge (3), BlockSecRT-DETR incorporates a decentralized blockchain-secured update validation mechanism that enables tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and trust-free authenticated model aggregation without relying on a central server. We evaluated the proposed framework under a missing-class Non-IID partition of the KITTI dataset and conducted a blockchain case study to quantify security overhead. TEM improves inference latency by 17.2% and reduces encoder FLOPs by 47.8%, while maintaining global detection accuracy (89.20% mAP@0.5). The blockchain integration adds 400 ms per round, and the ledger size remains under 12 KB due to metadata-only on-chain storage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Closed-loop Uplink Radio Resource Management in CF-O-RAN Empowered 5G Aerial Corridor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12694</link><description>arXiv:2601.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uplink (UL) radio resource management for 5G aerial corridors with an open-radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. Our objective is to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) by jointly optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-open radio unit (O-RU) association and UL transmit power under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Owing to its NP-hard nature, the formulated problem is decomposed into two tractable sub-problems solved via alternating optimization (AO) using two computationally efficient algorithms. We then propose (i) a QoS-driven and multi-connectivity-enabled association algorithm incorporating UAV-centric and O-RU-centric criteria with targeted refinement for weak UAVs, and (ii) a bisection-guided fixed-point power control algorithm achieving global optimality with significantly reduced complexity, hosted as xApp at the near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) of O-RAN. Solving the resource-allocation problem requires global channel state information (CSI), which incurs substantial measurement and signaling overhead. To mitigate this, we leverage a channel knowledge map (CKM) within the O-RAN non-RT RIC to enable efficient environment-aware CSI inference. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 440% improvement in minimum SE, 100% QoS satisfaction and fairness, while reducing runtime by up to 99.7% compared to an interior point solver-based power allocation solution, thereby enabling O-RAN compliant real-time deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UbuntuGuard: A Culturally-Grounded Policy Benchmark for Equitable AI Safety in African Languages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12696</link><description>arXiv:2601.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current guardian models are predominantly Western-centric and optimized for high-resource languages, leaving low-resource African languages vulnerable to evolving harms, cross-lingual safety failures, and cultural misalignment. Moreover, most guardian models rely on rigid, predefined safety categories that fail to generalize across diverse linguistic and sociocultural contexts. Robust safety, therefore, requires flexible, runtime-enforceable policies and benchmarks that reflect local norms, harm scenarios, and cultural expectations. We introduce UbuntuGuard, the first African policy-based safety benchmark built from adversarial queries authored by 155 domain experts across sensitive fields, including healthcare. From these expert-crafted queries, we derive context-specific safety policies and reference responses that capture culturally grounded risk signals, enabling policy-aligned evaluation of guardian models. We evaluate 13 models, comprising six general-purpose LLMs and seven guardian models across three distinct variants: static, dynamic, and multilingual. Our findings reveal that existing English-centric benchmarks overestimate real-world multilingual safety, cross-lingual transfer provides partial but insufficient coverage, and dynamic models, while better equipped to leverage policies at inference time, still struggle to fully localize African-language contexts. These findings highlight the urgent need for multilingual, culturally grounded safety benchmarks to enable the development of reliable and equitable guardian models for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Infrared-visible image fusion aims to integrate infrared and visible information into a single fused image. Existing 2D fusion methods focus on fusing images from fixed camera viewpoints, neglecting a comprehensive understanding of complex scenarios, which results in the loss of critical information about the scene. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Infrared-Visible Gaussian Fusion (IVGF) framework, which reconstructs scene geometry from multimodal 2D inputs and enables direct rendering of fused images. Specifically, we propose a cross-modal adjustment (CMA) module that modulates the opacity of Gaussians to solve the problem of cross-modal conflicts. Moreover, to preserve the distinctive features from both modalities, we introduce a fusion loss that guides the optimization of CMA, thus ensuring that the fused image retains the critical characteristics of each modality. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12697v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Two-Stage GPU Kernel Tuner Combining Semantic Refactoring and Search-Based Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12698</link><description>arXiv:2601.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GPU code optimization is a key performance bottleneck for HPC workloads as well as large-model training and inference. Although compiler optimizations and hand-written kernels can partially alleviate this issue, achieving near-hardware-limit performance still relies heavily on manual code refactoring and parameter tuning. Recent progress in LLM-agent-based kernel generation and optimization has been reported, yet many approaches primarily focus on direct code rewriting, where parameter choices are often implicit and hard to control, or require human intervention, leading to unstable performance gains. This paper introduces a template-based rewriting layer on top of an agent-driven iterative loop: kernels are semantically refactored into explicitly parameterizable templates, and template parameters are then optimized via search-based autotuning, yielding more stable and higher-quality speedups. Experiments on a set of real-world kernels demonstrate speedups exceeding 3x in the best case. We extract representative CUDA kernels from SGLang as evaluation targets; the proposed agentic tuner iteratively performs templating, testing, analysis, and planning, and leverages profiling feedback to execute constrained parameter search under hardware resource limits. Compared to agent-only direct rewriting, the template-plus-search design significantly reduces the randomness of iterative optimization, making the process more interpretable and enabling a more systematic approach toward high-performance configurations. The proposed method can be further extended to OpenCL, HIP, and other backends to deliver automated performance optimization for real production workloads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12698v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Resource-Conscious RL Algorithms for Deep Brain Stimulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12699</link><description>arXiv:2601.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has proven to be a promising treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). DBS involves stimulating specific regions of the brain's Basal Ganglia (BG) using electric impulses to alleviate symptoms of PD such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Although most clinical DBS approaches today use a fixed frequency and amplitude, they suffer from side effects (such as slurring of speech) and shortened battery life of the implant. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.
  We propose a new Time &amp; Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms. Our T3P MAB algorithm is deployed on a variety of microcontroller unit (MCU) setups to show its efficiency in terms of power consumption as opposed to other existing RL approaches used in recent work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RPT*: Global Planning with Probabilistic Terminals for Target Search in Complex Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12701</link><description>arXiv:2601.12701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing problems such as Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP), seeks a path to visit all the vertices in a graph while minimizing the path cost. This paper studies a variant, HPP with Probabilistic Terminals (HPP-PT), where each vertex has a probability representing the likelihood that the robot's path terminates there, and the objective is to minimize the expected path cost. HPP-PT arises in target object search, where a mobile robot must visit all candidate locations to find an object, and prior knowledge of the object's location is expressed as vertex probabilities. While routing problems have been studied for decades, few of them consider uncertainty as required in this work. The challenge lies not only in optimally ordering the vertices, as in standard HPP, but also in handling history dependency: the expected path cost depends on the order in which vertices were previously visited. This makes many existing methods inefficient or inapplicable. To address the challenge, we propose a search-based approach RPT* with solution optimality guarantees, which leverages dynamic programming in a new state space to bypass the history dependency and novel heuristics to speed up the computation. Building on RPT*, we design a Hierarchical Autonomous Target Search (HATS) system that combines RPT* with either Bayesian filtering for lifelong target search with noisy sensors, or autonomous exploration to find targets in unknown environments. Experiments in both simulation and real robot show that our approach can naturally balance between exploitation and exploration, thereby finding targets more quickly on average than baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12701v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Spectroscopy: Susceptibility Clusters in Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12703</link><description>arXiv:2601.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopy infers the internal structure of physical systems by measuring their response to perturbations. We apply this principle to neural networks: perturbing the data distribution by upweighting a token $y$ in context $x$, we measure the model's response via susceptibilities $\chi_{xy}$, which are covariances between component-level observables and the perturbation computed over a localized Gibbs posterior via stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). Theoretically, we show that susceptibilities decompose as a sum over modes of the data distribution, explaining why tokens that follow their contexts "for similar reasons" cluster together in susceptibility space. Empirically, we apply this methodology to Pythia-14M, developing a conductance-based clustering algorithm that identifies 510 interpretable clusters ranging from grammatical patterns to code structure to mathematical notation. Comparing to sparse autoencoders, 50% of our clusters match SAE features, validating that both methods recover similar structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12703v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptively trained Physics-informed Radial Basis Function Neural Networks for Solving Multi-asset Option Pricing Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12704</link><description>arXiv:2601.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the numerical solution of Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE) for option valuation with multiple underlying assets. We develop a physics-informed (PI) machine learning algorithm based on a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) that concurrently optimizes the network architecture and predicts the target option price. The physics-informed radial basis function neural network (PIRBFNN) combines the strengths of the traditional radial basis function collocation method and the physics-informed neural network machine learning approach to effectively solve PDE problems in the financial context. By employing a PDE residual-based technique to adaptively refine the distribution of hidden neurons during the training process, the PIRBFNN facilitates accurate and efficient handling of multidimensional option pricing models featuring non-smooth payoff conditions. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a set of experiments encompassing a single-asset European put option, a double-asset exchange option, and a four-asset basket call option.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How do the Global South Diasporas Mobilize for Transnational Political Change?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12705</link><description>arXiv:2601.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how non-resident Bangladeshis mobilized during the 2024 quota-reform turned pro-democracy movement, leveraging social platforms and remittance flows to challenge state authority. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, we identify four phases of their collective action: technology-mediated shifts to active engagement, rapid transnational network building, strategic execution of remittance boycott, reframing economic dependence as political leverage, and adaptive responses to government surveillance and information blackouts. We extend postcolonial computing by introducing the idea of "diasporic superposition," which shows how diasporas can exercise political and economic influence from hybrid positionalities that both contest and complicate power asymmetries. We reframe diaspora engagement by highlighting how migrants participate in and reshape homeland politics, beyond narratives of integration in host countries. We advance the scholarship on financial technologies by foregrounding their relationship with moral economies of care, state surveillance, regulatory constraints, and uneven international economic power dynamics. Together, these contributions theorize how transnational activism and digital technologies intersect to mobilize political change in Global South contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trend-Adjusted Time Series Models with an Application to Gold Price Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12706</link><description>arXiv:2601.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data play a critical role in various fields, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and engineering. A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12706v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoding Rewards in Competitive Games: Inverse Game Theory with Entropy Regularization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12707</link><description>arXiv:2601.12707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the unknown reward functions driving agents' behaviors is of central interest in inverse reinforcement learning and game theory. To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm. Further, we conduct extensive numerical studies to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, offering new insights into decision-making in competitive environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12707v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neurosymbolic LoRA: Why and When to Tune Weights vs. Rewrite Prompts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12711</link><description>arXiv:2601.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted either through numerical updates that alter model parameters or symbolic manipulations that work on discrete prompts or logical constraints. While numerical fine-tuning excels at injecting new factual knowledge, symbolic updates offer flexible control of style and alignment without retraining. We introduce a neurosymbolic LoRA framework that dynamically combines these two complementary strategies. Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed. Additionally, the refined prompts produced during symbolic editing serve as high-quality, reusable training data, an important benefit in data-scarce domains like mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones show that neurosymbolic LoRA consistently outperforms purely numerical or purely symbolic baselines, demonstrating superior adaptability and improved performance. Our findings highlight the value of interleaving numerical and symbolic updates to unlock a new level of versatility in language model fine-tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12711v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Detection of Inefficient Data Mapping Patterns in Heterogeneous OpenMP Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12713</link><description>arXiv:2601.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing prevalence of heterogeneous computing, CPUs are increasingly being paired with accelerators to achieve new levels of performance and energy efficiency. However, data movement between devices remains a significant bottleneck, complicating application development. Existing performance tools require considerable programmer intervention to diagnose and locate data transfer inefficiencies. To address this, we propose dynamic analysis techniques to detect and profile inefficient data transfer and allocation patterns in heterogeneous applications. We implemented these techniques into OMPDataPerf, which provides detailed traces of problematic data mappings, source code attribution, and assessments of optimization potential in heterogeneous OpenMP applications. OMPDataPerf uses the OpenMP Tools Interface (OMPT) and incurs only a 5 % geometric-mean runtime overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] P2L-CA: An Effective Parameter Tuning Framework for Rehearsal-Free Multi-Label Class-Incremental Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12714</link><description>arXiv:2601.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label Class-Incremental Learning aims to continuously recognize novel categories in complex scenes where multiple objects co-occur. However, existing approaches often incur high computational costs due to full-parameter fine-tuning and substantial storage overhead from memory buffers, or they struggle to address feature confusion and domain discrepancies adequately. To overcome these limitations, we introduce P2L-CA, a parameter-efficient framework that integrates a Prompt-to-Label module with a Continuous Adapter module. The P2L module leverages class-specific prompts to disentangle multi-label representations while incorporating linguistic priors to enforce stable semantic-visual alignment. Meanwhile, the CA module employs lightweight adapters to mitigate domain gaps between pre-trained models and downstream tasks, thereby enhancing model plasticity. Extensive experiments across standard and challenging MLCIL settings on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC show that P2L-CA not only achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods but also demonstrates strong generalization in CIL scenarios, all while requiring minimal trainable parameters and eliminating the need for memory buffers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12714v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RSOD: Reliability-Guided Sonar Image Object Detection with Extremely Limited Labels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12715</link><description>arXiv:2601.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection in sonar images is a key technology in underwater detection systems. Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data. We also collected a new dataset to provide more valuable data for research in the field of sonar.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12715v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CellularSpecSec-Bench: A Staged Benchmark for Evidence-Grounded Interpretation and Security Reasoning over 3GPP Specifications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12716</link><description>arXiv:2601.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular networks are critical infrastructure supporting billions of worldwide users and safety- and mission-critical services. Vulnerabilities in cellular networks can therefore cause service disruption, privacy breaches, and broad societal harm, motivating growing efforts to analyze 3GPP specifications that define required device and operator behavior. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability for reading technical documents, cellular specifications impose unique challenges: faithful interpretation of normative language, reasoning across cross-referenced clauses, and verifiable conclusions grounded in multimodal evidence such as tables and figures. To address these challenges, we propose CellSpecSec-ARI, a unified Adapt-Retrieve-Integrate framework for systematic understanding and standard-driven security analysis of 3GPP specifications; CellularSpecSec-Bench, a staged benchmark, containing newly constructed high-quality datasets with expert-verified and corrected subsets from prior open-source resources. Together, they establish an accessible and reproducible foundation for quantifying progress in specification understanding and security reasoning in the cellular network security domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12716v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dataset of GenAI-Assisted Information Problem Solving in Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12718</link><description>arXiv:2601.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Problem Solving (IPS) is a critical competency for academic and professional success in education, work, and life. The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly tools like ChatGPT, has introduced new possibilities for supporting students in complex IPS tasks. However, empirical insights into how students engage with GenAI during IPS and how these tools can be effectively leveraged for learning remain limited. Moreover, differences in background, shaped by cultural and socioeconomic factors, pose additional challenges to the equitable integration of GenAI in educational contexts. To address this gap, we present an open-source dataset collected from 279 students at a public Australian university. The dataset was generated through students' use of FLoRA, a GenAI-powered educational platform that widely adopted in the field of learning analytics. Within FLoRA, students interacted with an embedded GenAI chatbot to gather information and synthesize it into data science project proposals. The dataset captures fine-grained, multi-dimensional records of GenAI-assisted IPS processes, including: (i) student-GenAI dialogue transcripts; (ii) writing process log traces; (iii) final project proposals with human-assigned assessment scores; (iv) surveys of biographic and prior knowledge in data science and AI; and (v) surveys capturing students' GenAI experience and perceptions of GenAI's effectiveness in supporting IPS. This dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of GenAI's role in educational IPS and informing the design of adaptive, inclusive AI-powered learning tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12718v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] S2DiT: Sandwich Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Streaming Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12719</link><description>arXiv:2601.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently improved video generation quality. However, their heavy computational cost makes real-time or on-device generation infeasible. In this work, we introduce S2DiT, a Streaming Sandwich Diffusion Transformer designed for efficient, high-fidelity, and streaming video generation on mobile hardware. S2DiT generates more tokens but maintains efficiency with novel efficient attentions: a mixture of LinConv Hybrid Attention (LCHA) and Stride Self-Attention (SSA). Based on this, we uncover the sandwich design via a budget-aware dynamic programming search, achieving superior quality and efficiency. We further propose a 2-in-1 distillation framework that transfers the capacity of large teacher models (e.g., Wan 2.2-14B) to the compact few-step sandwich model. Together, S2DiT achieves quality on par with state-of-the-art server video models, while streaming at over 10 FPS on an iPhone.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12719v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Teaching Large Reasoning Models Effective Reflection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12720</link><description>arXiv:2601.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have recently shown impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks, often by engaging in self-reflective behaviors such as self-critique and backtracking. However, not all reflections are beneficial-many are superficial, offering little to no improvement over the original answer and incurring computation overhead. In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective. Building on this strong foundation, we further introduce Reinforcement Learning with Effective Reflection Rewards (RLERR). RLERR leverages the high-quality reflections initialized by SCFT to construct reward signals, guiding the model to internalize the self-correction process via reinforcement learning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, AIME2024 and AIME2025, show that SCFT and RLERR significantly improve both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Optimization benchmarks play a fundamental role in assessing algorithm performance; however, existing artificial benchmarks often fail to capture the diversity and irregularity of real-world problem structures, while benchmarks derived from real-world problems are costly and difficult to construct. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary automatic benchmark generation framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a generative operator, termed the LLM-driven evolutionary benchmark generator (LLM-EBG). In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\% of trials. Furthermore, exploratory landscape analysis reveals that benchmarks favoring GA are highly sensitive to variable scaling, demonstrating that the proposed framework can generate problems with distinct geometric characteristics that reflect the intrinsic search behaviors of different optimization algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12723v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explicit Entropic Constructions for Coverage, Facility Location, and Graph Cuts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12724</link><description>arXiv:2601.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shannon entropy is a polymatroidal set function and lies at the foundation of information theory, yet the class of entropic polymatroids is strictly smaller than the class of all submodular functions. In parallel, submodular and combinatorial information measures (SIMs) have recently been proposed as a principled framework for extending entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information to general submodular functions, and have been used extensively in data subset selection, active learning, domain adaptation, and representation learning. This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic?
  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense. These results establish a direct bridge between combinatorial information measures and classical information theory for many of the most common submodular objectives used in applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12724v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-exhibited Personality Traits Can Shape Human Self-concept through Conversations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12727</link><description>arXiv:2601.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AI can exhibit recognizable and measurable personality traits during conversations to improve user experience. However, as human understandings of their personality traits can be affected by their interaction partners' traits, a potential risk is that AI traits may shape and bias users' self-concept of their own traits. To explore the possibility, we conducted a randomized behavioral experiment. Our results indicate that after conversations about personal topics with an LLM-based AI chatbot using GPT-4o default personality traits, users' self-concepts aligned with the AI's measured personality traits. The longer the conversation, the greater the alignment. This alignment led to increased homogeneity in self-concepts among users. We also observed that the degree of self-concept alignment was positively associated with users' conversation enjoyment. Our findings uncover how AI personality traits can shape users' self-concepts through human-AI conversation, highlighting both risks and opportunities. We provide important design implications for developing more responsible and ethical AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12727v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DC-VLAQ: Query-Residual Aggregation for Robust Visual Place Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12729</link><description>arXiv:2601.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central challenges in visual place recognition (VPR) is learning a robust global representation that remains discriminative under large viewpoint changes, illumination variations, and severe domain shifts. While visual foundation models (VFMs) provide strong local features, most existing methods rely on a single model, overlooking the complementary cues offered by different VFMs. However, exploiting such complementary information inevitably alters token distributions, which challenges the stability of existing query-based global aggregation schemes. To address these challenges, we propose DC-VLAQ, a representation-centric framework that integrates the fusion of complementary VFMs and robust global aggregation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight residual-guided complementary fusion that anchors representations in the DINOv2 feature space while injecting complementary semantics from CLIP through a learned residual correction. In addition, we propose the Vector of Local Aggregated Queries (VLAQ), a query--residual global aggregation scheme that encodes local tokens by their residual responses to learnable queries, resulting in improved stability and the preservation of fine-grained discriminative cues. Extensive experiments on standard VPR benchmarks, including Pitts30k, Tokyo24/7, MSLS, Nordland, SPED, and AmsterTime, demonstrate that DC-VLAQ consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts and long-term appearance changes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12729v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization Dominates Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12730</link><description>arXiv:2601.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off is a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). With Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), training tends to be exploitation driven: entropy decreases monotonically, samples convergence, and exploration fades. Most existing fixes are \textbf{sample-centric}: they seek or bonus rare samples, assuming exploration comes from novel trajectories and tokens. These heuristics depend on the "luck" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a "better" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization (DCPO), which reformulates entropy regulation as distribution-level regularization. DCPO achieves controllable entropy fully on-policy without sampling from external distributions, enabling efficient exploration while maintaining training stability. Across multiple models and seven benchmarks, DCPO improves over GRPO by about 20\% on average. Overall, DCPO replaces sample-level heuristics with distribution-level principles, offering a theoretically grounded and flexible framework for controllable exploration and a stronger EE trade-off. The code is available in https://github.com/597358816/DCPO.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Shared Geometry of Difficulty in Multilingual Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12731</link><description>arXiv:2601.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting problem-difficulty in large language models (LLMs) refers to estimating how difficult a task is according to the model itself, typically by training linear probes on its internal representations. In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12731v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OpenAI for OpenAPI: Automated generation of REST API specification via LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12735</link><description>arXiv:2601.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: REST APIs, based on the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architecture, are the primary type of Web API. The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) serves as the de facto standard for describing REST APIs and is crucial for multiple software engineering tasks. However, developers face challenges in writing and maintaining OAS. Although static analysis shows potential for OAS generation, it is limited to specific programming languages and development frameworks. The powerful code understanding capabilities of LLMs offer new opportunities for OAS generation, yet they are constrained by context limitations and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose the OpenAI OpenAPI Project Scanner (OOPS), the first technology-agnostic LLM-based static analysis method for OAS generation, requiring fewer technology-specific rules and less human expert intervention. OOPS is implemented as an LLM agent workflow comprising two key steps: endpoint method extraction and OAS generation. By constructing an API dependency graph, it establishes necessary file associations to address LLMs' context limitations. Through multi-stage generation and self-refine, it mitigates both syntactic and semantic hallucinations during OAS generation. We evaluated OOPS on 12 real-world REST APIs spanning 5 programming languages and 8 development frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that OOPS accurately generates high-quality OAS for REST APIs implemented with diverse technologies, achieving an average F1-score exceeding 98% for endpoint method inference, 97% for both request parameter and response inference, and 92% for parameter constraint inference. The input tokens average below 5.6K with a maximum of 16.2K, while the output tokens average below 0.9K with a maximum of 7.7K.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KaoLRM: Repurposing Pre-trained Large Reconstruction Models for Parametric 3D Face Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12736</link><description>arXiv:2601.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose KaoLRM to re-target the learned prior of the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for parametric 3D face reconstruction from single-view images. Parametric 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) have been widely used for facial reconstruction due to their compact and interpretable parameterization, yet existing 3DMM regressors often exhibit poor consistency across varying viewpoints. To address this, we harness the pre-trained 3D prior of LRM and incorporate FLAME-based 2D Gaussian Splatting into LRM's rendering pipeline. Specifically, KaoLRM projects LRM's pre-trained triplane features into the FLAME parameter space to recover geometry, and models appearance via 2D Gaussian primitives that are tightly coupled to the FLAME mesh. The rich prior enables the FLAME regressor to be aware of the 3D structure, leading to accurate and robust reconstructions under self-occlusions and diverse viewpoints. Experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that KaoLRM achieves superior reconstruction accuracy and cross-view consistency, while existing methods remain sensitive to viewpoint variations.

Abstract: Long documents pose many challenges to current intelligent writing systems. These include maintaining consistency across sections, sustaining efficient planning and writing as documents become more complex, and effectively providing and integrating AI assistance to the user. Existing AI co-writing tools offer either inline suggestions or limited structured planning, but rarely support the entire writing process that begins with high-level ideas and ends with polished prose, in which many layers of planning and outlining are needed. Here, we introduce TreeWriter, a hierarchical writing system that represents documents as trees and integrates contextual AI support. TreeWriter allows authors to create, save, and refine document outlines at multiple levels, facilitating drafting, understanding, and iterative editing of long documents. A built-in AI agent can dynamically load relevant content, navigate the document hierarchy, and provide context-aware editing suggestions. A within-subject study (N=12) comparing TreeWriter with Google Docs + Gemini on long-document editing and creative writing tasks shows that TreeWriter improves idea exploration/development, AI helpfulness, and perceived authorial control. A two-month field deployment (N=8) further demonstrated that hierarchical organization supports collaborative writing. Our findings highlight the potential of hierarchical, tree-structured editors with integrated AI support and provide design guidelines for future AI-assisted writing tools that balance automation with user agency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12740v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AirHunt: Bridging VLM Semantics and Continuous Planning for Efficient Aerial Object Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12742</link><description>arXiv:2601.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have provided rich semantic understanding that empowers drones to search for open-set objects via natural language instructions. However, prior systems struggle to integrate VLMs into practical aerial systems due to orders-of-magnitude frequency mismatch between VLM inference and real-time planning, as well as VLMs' limited 3D scene understanding. They also lack a unified mechanism to balance semantic guidance with motion efficiency in large-scale environments. To address these challenges, we present AirHunt, an aerial object navigation system that efficiently locates open-set objects with zero-shot generalization in outdoor environments by seamlessly fusing VLM semantic reasoning with continuous path planning. AirHunt features a dual-pathway asynchronous architecture that establishes a synergistic interface between VLM reasoning and path planning, enabling continuous flight with adaptive semantic guidance that evolves through motion. Moreover, we propose an active dual-task reasoning module that exploits geometric and semantic redundancy to enable selective VLM querying, and a semantic-geometric coherent planning module that dynamically reconciles semantic priorities and motion efficiency in a unified framework, enabling seamless adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. We evaluate AirHunt across diverse object navigation tasks and environments, demonstrating a higher success rate with lower navigation error and reduced flight time compared to state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiments further validate AirHunt's practical capability in complex and challenging environments.

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) allows operators to specify high-level network goals rather than low-level configurations. While recent work demonstrates that large language models can automate configuration tasks, a distinct class of intents requires generating optimization code to compute provably optimal solutions for traffic engineering, routing, and resource allocation. Current systems assume text-based intent expression, requiring operators to enumerate topologies and parameters in prose. Network practitioners naturally reason about structure through diagrams, yet whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process annotated network sketches into correct optimization code remains unexplored. We present IntentOpt, a benchmark of 85 optimization problems across 17 categories, evaluating four VLMs (GPT-5-Mini, Claude-Haiku-4.5, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) under three prompting strategies on multimodal versus text-only inputs. Our evaluation shows that visual parameter extraction reduces execution success by 12-21 percentage points (pp), with GPT-5-Mini dropping from 93% to 72%. Program-of-thought prompting decreases performance by up to 13 pp, and open-source models lag behind closed-source ones, with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision reaching 18% compared to 75% for GPT-5-Mini. These results establish baseline capabilities and limitations of current VLMs for optimization code generation within an IBN system. We also demonstrate practical feasibility through a case study that deploys VLM-generated code to network testbed infrastructure using Model Context Protocol.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745</link><description>arXiv:2601.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12745v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SSPFormer: Self-Supervised Pretrained Transformer for MRI Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12747</link><description>arXiv:2601.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pre-trained transformer demonstrates remarkable generalization ability in natural image processing. However, directly transferring it to magnetic resonance images faces two key challenges: the inability to adapt to the specificity of medical anatomical structures and the limitations brought about by the privacy and scarcity of medical data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Self-Supervised Pretrained Transformer (SSPFormer) for MRI images, which effectively learns domain-specific feature representations of medical images by leveraging unlabeled raw imaging data. To tackle the domain gap and data scarcity, we introduce inverse frequency projection masking, which prioritizes the reconstruction of high-frequency anatomical regions to enforce structure-aware representation learning. Simultaneously, to enhance robustness against real-world MRI artifacts, we employ frequency-weighted FFT noise enhancement that injects physiologically realistic noise into the Fourier domain. Together, these strategies enable the model to learn domain-invariant and artifact-robust features directly from raw scans. Through extensive experiments on segmentation, super-resolution, and denoising tasks, the proposed SSPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, fully verifying its ability to capture fine-grained MRI image fidelity and adapt to clinical application requirements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Robust Process Reward Modeling via Noise-aware Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12748</link><description>arXiv:2601.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have achieved strong results in complex reasoning, but are bottlenecked by costly process-level supervision. A widely used alternative, Monte Carlo Estimation (MCE), defines process rewards as the probability that a policy model reaches the correct final answer from a given reasoning step. However, step correctness is an intrinsic property of the reasoning trajectory, and should be invariant to policy choice. Our empirical findings show that MCE producing policy-dependent rewards that induce label noise, including false positives that reward incorrect steps and false negatives that penalize correct ones. To address above challenges, we propose a two-stage framework to mitigate noisy supervision. In the labeling stage, we introduce a reflection-aware label correction mechanism that uses a large language model (LLM) as a judge to detect reflection and self-correction behaviors related to the current reasoning step, thereby suppressing overestimated rewards. In the training stage, we further propose a \underline{\textbf{N}}oise-\underline{\textbf{A}}ware \underline{\textbf{I}}terative \underline{\textbf{T}}raining framework that enables the PRM to progressively refine noisy labels based on its own confidence. Extensive Experiments show that our method substantially improves step-level correctness discrimination, achieving up to a 27\% absolute gain in average F1 over PRMs trained with noisy supervision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12748v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Local-to-Global Collaborative Perception via Joint Communication and Computation Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12749</link><description>arXiv:2601.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving relies on accurate perception to ensure safe driving. Collaborative perception improves accuracy by mitigating the sensing limitations of individual vehicles, such as limited perception range and occlusion-induced blind spots. However, collaborative perception often suffers from high communication overhead due to redundant data transmission, as well as increasing computation latency caused by excessive load with growing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) participation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel local-to-global collaborative perception framework (LGCP) to achieve collaboration in a communication- and computation-efficient manner. The road of interest is partitioned into non-overlapping areas, each of which is assigned a dedicated CAV group to perform localized perception. A designated leader in each group collects and fuses perception data from its members, and uploads the perception result to the roadside unit (RSU), establishing a link between local perception and global awareness. The RSU aggregates perception results from all groups and broadcasts a global view to all CAVs. LGCP employs a centralized scheduling strategy via the RSU, which assigns CAV groups to each area, schedules their transmissions, aggregates area-level local perception results, and propagates the global view to all CAVs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LGCP framework achieves an average 44 times reduction in the amount of data transmission, while maintaining or even improving the overall collaborative performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Approximation Schemes for Sequential Hiring Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12750</link><description>arXiv:2601.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main contribution of this paper resides in providing novel algorithmic advances and analytical insights for the sequential hiring problem, a recently introduced dynamic optimization model where a firm adaptively fills a limited number of positions from a pool of applicants with known values and acceptance probabilities. While earlier research established a strong foundation -- notably an LP-based $(1 - \frac{e^{-k}k^k}{k!})$-approximation by Epstein and Ma (Operations Research, 2024) -- the attainability of superior approximation guarantees has remained a central open question.
  Our work addresses this challenge by establishing the first polynomial-time approximation scheme for sequential hiring, proposing an $O(n^{O(1)} \cdot T^{2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{2})}})$-time construction of semi-adaptive policies whose expected reward is within factor $1 - \epsilon$ of optimal. To overcome the constant-factor optimality loss inherent to earlier literature, and to circumvent intrinsic representational barriers of adaptive policies, our approach is driven by the following innovations:
  -- The block-responsive paradigm: We introduce block-responsive policies, a new class of decision-making strategies, selecting ordered sets (blocks) of applicants rather than single individuals, while still allowing for internal reactivity.
  -- Adaptivity and efficiency: We prove that these policies can nearly match the performance of general adaptive policies while utilizing polynomially-sized decision trees.
  -- Efficient construction: By developing a recursive enumeration-based framework, we resolve the problematic ``few-positions'' regime, bypassing a fundamental hurdle that hindered previous approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12750v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Boolean Function-Theoretic Framework for Expressivity in GNNs with Applications to Fair Graph Mining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12751</link><description>arXiv:2601.12751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel expressivity framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) grounded in Boolean function theory, enabling a fine-grained analysis of their ability to capture complex subpopulation structures. We introduce the notion of \textit{Subpopulation Boolean Isomorphism} (SBI) as an invariant that strictly subsumes existing expressivity measures such as Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL), biconnectivity-based, and homomorphism-based frameworks. Our theoretical results identify Fourier degree, circuit class (AC$^0$, NC$^1$), and influence as key barriers to expressivity in fairness-aware GNNs. We design a circuit-traversal-based fairness algorithm capable of handling subpopulations defined by high-complexity Boolean functions, such as parity, which break existing baselines. Experiments on real-world graphs show that our method achieves low fairness gaps across intersectional groups where state-of-the-art methods fail, providing the first principled treatment of GNN expressivity tailored to fairness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12751v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PAIR-SAFE: A Paired-Agent Approach for Runtime Auditing and Refining AI-Mediated Mental Health Support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12754</link><description>arXiv:2601.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet they can produce responses that are overly directive, inconsistent, or clinically misaligned, particularly in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Existing approaches to mitigating these risks largely rely on implicit alignment through training or prompting, offering limited transparency and runtime accountability. We introduce PAIR-SAFE, a paired-agent framework for auditing and refining AI-generated mental health support that integrates a Responder agent with a supervisory Judge agent grounded in the clinically validated Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI-4) framework. The Judgeaudits each response and provides structuredALLOW or REVISE decisions that guide runtime response refinement. We simulate counseling interactions using a support-seeker simulator derived from human-annotated motivational interviewing data. We find that Judge-supervised interactions show significant improvements in key MITI dimensions, including Partnership, Seek Collaboration, and overall Relational quality. Our quantitative findings are supported by qualitative expert evaluation, which further highlights the nuances of runtime supervision. Together, our results reveal that such pairedagent approach can provide clinically grounded auditing and refinement for AI-assisted conversational mental health support.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12754v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VISPA: Pluralistic Alignment via Automatic Value Selection and Activation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12758</link><description>arXiv:2601.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, it is essential that their outputs reflect not average} human preference, rather range of varying perspectives. Achieving such pluralism, however, remains challenging. Existing approaches consider limited values or rely on prompt-level interventions, lacking value control and representation. To address this, we introduce VISPA, a training-free pluralistic alignment framework, that enables direct control over value expression by dynamic selection and internal model activation steering. Across extensive empirical studies spanning multiple models and evaluation settings, we show VISPA is performant across all pluralistic alignment modes in healthcare and beyond. Further analysis reveals VISPA is adaptable with different steering initiations, model, and/or values. These results suggest that pluralistic alignment can be achieved through internal activation mechanisms, offering a scalable path toward language models that serves all.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12758v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Moaw: Unleashing Motion Awareness for Video Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12761</link><description>arXiv:2601.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video diffusion models, trained on large-scale datasets, naturally capture correspondences of shared features across frames. Recent works have exploited this property for tasks such as optical flow prediction and tracking in a zero-shot setting. Motivated by these findings, we investigate whether supervised training can more fully harness the tracking capability of video diffusion models. To this end, we propose Moaw, a framework that unleashes motion awareness for video diffusion models and leverages it to facilitate motion transfer. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for motion perception, shifting its modality from image-to-video generation to video-to-dense-tracking. We then construct a motion-labeled dataset to identify features that encode the strongest motion information, and inject them into a structurally identical video generation model. Owing to the homogeneity between the two networks, these features can be naturally adapted in a zero-shot manner, enabling motion transfer without additional adapters. Our work provides a new paradigm for bridging generative modeling and motion understanding, paving the way for more unified and controllable video learning frameworks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Teaching LLMs to Learn Tool Trialing and Execution through Environment Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12762</link><description>arXiv:2601.12762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to solve complex real-world problems. However, the robustness of existing methods remains a critical challenge when confronting novel or evolving tools. Existing trajectory-centric paradigms primarily rely on memorizing static solution paths during training, which limits the ability of LLMs to generalize tool usage to newly introduced or previously unseen tools. In this paper, we propose ToolMaster, a framework that shifts tool use from imitating golden tool-calling trajectories to actively learning tool usage through interaction with the environment. To optimize LLMs for tool planning and invocation, ToolMaster adopts a trial-and-execution paradigm, which trains LLMs to first imitate teacher-generated trajectories containing explicit tool trials and self-correction, followed by reinforcement learning to coordinate the trial and execution phases jointly. This process enables agents to autonomously explore correct tool usage by actively interacting with environments and forming experiential knowledge that benefits tool execution. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolMaster significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of generalization and robustness across unseen or unfamiliar tools.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has garnered much attention in recent years by eliminating the need of source-domain data in cross-domain tasks, but existing SFOD methods suffer from the Source Bias problem, i.e. the adapted model remains skewed towards the source domain, leading to poor generalization and error accumulation during self-training. To overcome this challenge, we propose Debiased Source-free Object Detection (DSOD), a novel VFM-assisted SFOD framework that can effectively mitigate source bias with the help of powerful VFMs. Specifically, we propose Unified Feature Injection (UFI) module that integrates VFM features into the CNN backbone through Simple-Scale Extension (SSE) and Domain-aware Adaptive Weighting (DAAW). Then, we propose Semantic-aware Feature Regularization (SAFR) that constrains feature learning to prevent overfitting to source domain characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a VFM-free variant, termed DSOD-distill for computation-restricted scenarios through a novel Dual-Teacher distillation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DSOD outperforms state-of-the-art SFOD methods, achieving 48.1% AP on Normal-to-Foggy weather adaptation, 39.3% AP on Cross-scene adaptation, and 61.4% AP on Synthetic-to-Real adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12765v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spatial-VLN: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation With Explicit Spatial Perception and Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12766</link><description>arXiv:2601.12766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in generalization but suffer from insufficient spatial perception. Focusing on complex continuous environments, we categorize key perceptual bottlenecks into three spatial challenges: door interaction,multi-room navigation, and ambiguous instruction execution, where existing methods consistently suffer high failure rates. We present Spatial-VLN, a perception-guided exploration framework designed to overcome these challenges. The framework consists of two main modules. The Spatial Perception Enhancement (SPE) module integrates panoramic filtering with specialized door and region experts to produce spatially coherent, cross-view consistent perceptual representations. Building on this foundation, our Explored Multi-expert Reasoning (EMR) module uses parallel LLM experts to address waypoint-level semantics and region-level spatial transitions. When discrepancies arise between expert predictions, a query-and-explore mechanism is activated, prompting the agent to actively probe critical areas and resolve perceptual ambiguities. Experiments on VLN-CE demonstrate that Spatial VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance using only low-cost LLMs. Furthermore, to validate real-world applicability, we introduce a value-based waypoint sampling strategy that effectively bridges the Sim2Real gap. Extensive real-world evaluations confirm that our framework delivers superior generalization and robustness in complex environments.

Abstract: Video-text retrieval (VTR) aims to locate relevant videos using natural language queries. Current methods, often based on pre-trained models like CLIP, are hindered by video's inherent redundancy and their reliance on coarse, final-layer features, limiting matching accuracy. To address this, we introduce the HVP-Net (Hierarchical Visual Perception Network), a framework that mines richer video semantics by extracting and refining features from multiple intermediate layers of a vision encoder. Our approach progressively distills salient visual concepts from raw patch-tokens at different semantic levels, mitigating redundancy while preserving crucial details for alignment. This results in a more robust video representation, leading to new state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks including MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. Our work validates the effectiveness of exploiting hierarchical features for advancing video-text retrieval.

Abstract: Building 3D animatable head avatars from a single image is an important yet challenging problem. Existing methods generally collapse under large camera pose variations, compromising the realism of 3D avatars. In this work, we propose a new framework to tackle the novel setting of one-shot 3D full-head animatable avatar reconstruction in a single feed-forward pass, enabling real-time animation and simultaneous 360$^\circ$ rendering views. To facilitate efficient animation control, we model 3D head avatars with Gaussian primitives embedded on the surface of a parametric face model within the UV space. To obtain knowledge of full-head geometry and textures, we leverage rich 3D full-head priors within a pretrained 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) for global full-head feature extraction and multi-view supervision. To increase the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction of the input image, we take advantage of the symmetric nature of the UV space and human faces to fuse local fine-grained input image features with the global full-head textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving high-quality 3D full-head modeling as well as real-time animation, thereby improving the realism of 3D talking avatars.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12770v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Does This Name Remind You of?

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, yet methods for effectively eliciting this knowledge remain underexplored. Nationality and region prediction tasks require understanding of not only linguistic features but also cultural and historical background, making LLM world knowledge particularly valuable. However, conventional LLM prompting methods rely on direct reasoning approaches, which have limitations in applying abstract linguistic rules. We propose LLM Associative Memory Agents (LAMA), a novel framework that leverages LLM world knowledge as associative memory. Rather than directly inferring nationality from names, LAMA recalls famous individuals with the same name and aggregates their nationalities through indirect reasoning. A dual-agent architecture comprising a Person Agent and a Media Agent, specialized in different knowledge domains, recalls famous individuals in parallel, generating Top-1 predictions through voting and Top-K predictions through conditional completion. On a 99-country nationality prediction task, LAMA achieved 0.817 accuracy, substantially outperforming conventional LLM prompting methods and neural models. Our experiments reveal that LLMs exhibit higher reliability in recalling concrete examples than in abstract reasoning, that recall-based approaches are robust to low-frequency nationalities independent of data frequency distributions, and that the dual-agent architecture functions complementarily to produce synergistic effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a new multi-agent system that retrieves and aggregates LLM knowledge rather than prompting reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12771v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SDN-Blockchain Based Security Routing for UAV Communication via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12774</link><description>arXiv:2601.12774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network plays important roles in emergency communications. However, it is challenging to design reliable routing strategies that ensure low latency, energy efficiency, and security in the dynamic and attack-prone environments. To this end, we design a secure routing architecture integrating software-defined networking (SDN) for centralized control and blockchain for tamper-proof trust management. In particular, a novel security degree metric is introduced to quantify the UAV trustworthiness. Based on this architecture, we propose a beam search-proximal policy optimization (BSPPO) algorithm, where beam search (BS) pre-screens the high-security candidate paths, and proximal policy optimization (PPO) performs hop-by-hop routing decisions to support dynamic rerouting upon attack detections. Finally, extensive simulations under varying attack densities, packet sizes, and rerouting events demonstrate that BSPPO outperforms PPO, BS-Q learning, and BS-actor critic in terms of delay, energy consumption, and transmission success rate, showing the outstanding robustness and adaptability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12774v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Eddy-Resolving Global Ocean Forecasting with Multi-Scale Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12775</link><description>arXiv:2601.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on data-driven ocean models has progressed rapidly in recent years; however, the application of these models to global eddy-resolving ocean forecasting remains limited. The accurate representation of ocean dynamics across a wide range of spatial scales remains a major challenge in such applications. This study proposes a multi-scale graph neural network-based ocean model for 10-day global forecasting that improves short-term prediction skill and enhances the representation of multi-scale ocean variability. The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics. In addition, the model incorporates surface atmospheric variables along with ocean state variables as node inputs to improve short-term prediction accuracy by representing atmospheric forcing. Evaluation using surface kinetic energy spectra and case studies shows that the model accurately represents a broad range of spatial scales, while root mean square error comparisons demonstrate improved skill in short-term predictions. These results indicate that the proposed model delivers more accurate short-term forecasts and improved representation of multi-scale ocean dynamics, thereby highlighting its potential to advance data-driven, eddy-resolving global ocean forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12775v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-order Lagrange multiplier schemes for general Hamiltonian PDEs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12776</link><description>arXiv:2601.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier approach to construct linearly implicit energy-preserving schemes of arbitrary order for general Hamiltonian PDEs. Unlike the widely used auxiliary variable methods, this novel approach does not require the nonlinear part of the energy to be bounded from below, thereby offering broader applicability. Moreover, this approach preserves the original energy exactly at both the continuous and discrete levels, as opposed to a modified energy preserved by the auxiliary variable methods. Rigorous proofs are provided for the energy conservation and numerical accuracy of all derived schemes. The trade-off for these advantages is the need to solve a nonlinear algebraic equation to determine the Lagrange multiplier. Nevertheless, numerical experiments show that the associated computational cost is generally not dominant, indicating that the new schemes retain computational efficiency comparable to the auxiliary variable-based schemes. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and structure-preserving properties of the proposed schemes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12776v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Open Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation With Retrieval Augmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12779</link><description>arXiv:2601.12779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an input image and set of class names, panoptic segmentation aims to label each pixel in an image with class labels and instance labels. In comparison, Open Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation aims to facilitate the segmentation of arbitrary classes according to user input. The challenge is that a panoptic segmentation system trained on a particular dataset typically does not generalize well to unseen classes beyond the training data. In this work, we propose RetCLIP, a retrieval-augmented panoptic segmentation method that improves the performance of unseen classes. In particular, we construct a masked segment feature database using paired image-text data. At inference time, we use masked segment features from the input image as query keys to retrieve similar features and associated class labels from the database. Classification scores for the masked segment are assigned based on the similarity between query features and retrieved features. The retrieval-based classification scores are combined with CLIP-based scores to produce the final output. We incorporate our solution with a previous SOTA method (FC-CLIP). When trained on COCO, the proposed method demonstrates 30.9 PQ, 19.3 mAP, 44.0 mIoU on the ADE20k dataset, achieving +4.5 PQ, +2.5 mAP, +10.0 mIoU absolute improvement over the baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12779v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Extended Gabidulin-Kronecker Product Codes and Their Application to Cryptosystems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12780</link><description>arXiv:2601.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of Extended Gabidulin codes with a Kronecker product structure and propose three enhanced variants of the Rank Quasi-Cyclic (RQC) (Melchor et.al., IEEE IT, 2018) cryptosystem. First, we establish precise bounds on the minimum rank distance of Gabidulin-Kronecker product codes under two distinct parameter regimes. Specifically, when $n_{1}=k_{1}$ and $n_{2}=m&lt;n_{1}n_{2}$, the minimum rank distance is exactly $n_{2}-k_{2}+1$. This yields a new family of Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes, which are distinct from classical Gabidulin codes. For the case of $k_{1}\leq n_{1},k_{2}\leq n_{2},n_{1}n_{2}\leq m$, the minimum rank distance $d$ of Gabidulin-Kronecker product codes satisfies a tight upper and lower bound, i.e., $n_{2}-k_{2}+1 \leq d \leq (n_{1}-k_{1}+1)(n_{2}-k_{2}+1)$. Second, we introduce a new class of decodable rank-metric codes, namely Extended Gabidulin-Kronecker product (EGK) codes, which generalize the structure of Gabidulin-Kronecker product (GK) codes. We also propose a decoding algorithm that directly retrieves the codeword without recovering the error vector, thus improving efficiency. This algorithm achieves zero decoding failure probability when the error weight is within its correction capability. Third, we propose three enhanced variants of the RQC cryptosystem based on EGK codes, each offering a distinct trade-off between security and efficiency.

Recent neuro-symbolic REC approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to perform compositional reasoning, decomposing queries 4 structured programs and executing them step-by-step. While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data. Furthermore, VIRO shows superior computational efficiency in terms of throughput, high reliability with a program failure rate of less than 0.3%, and scalability through decoupled program generation from execution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12781v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sensing-Limited Control of Noiseless Linear Systems Under Nonlinear Observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12782</link><description>arXiv:2601.12782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental information-theoretic limits for the control and sensing of noiseless linear dynamical systems subject to a broad class of nonlinear observations. We analyze the interactions between the control and sensing components by characterizing the minimum information flow required for stability. Specifically, we derive necessary conditions for mean-square observability and stabilizability, demonstrating that the average directed information rate from the state to the observations must exceed the intrinsic expansion rate of the unstable dynamics. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by non-Gaussian distributions inherent to nonlinear observation channels, we establish sufficient conditions by imposing regularity assumptions, specifically log-concavity, on the system's probabilistic components. We show that under these conditions, the divergence of differential entropy implies the convergence of the estimation error, thereby closing the gap between information-theoretic bounds and estimation performance. By establishing these results, we unveil the fundamental performance limits imposed by the sensing layer, extending classical data-rate constraints to the more challenging regime of nonlinear observation models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12782v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unleashing Efficient Asynchronous RL Post-Training via Staleness-Constrained Rollout Coordination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12784</link><description>arXiv:2601.12784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has become pivotal for enhancing the capabilities of modern large models. A recent trend is to develop RL systems with a fully disaggregated architecture, which decouples the three RL phases (rollout, reward, and training) onto separate resources and executes them asynchronously. However, two critical data-level concerns arise: (1) asynchronous execution leads to data staleness in trajectories (the data generated by rollout) as the model parameters used in rollout may not be up to date, which impairs RL convergence; and (2) the length variation of trajectories introduces severe data skewness, leading to workload imbalance and degraded system performance.
  Existing systems fail to address these two concerns in a unified manner. Techniques that tightly control data staleness often constrain effective data skewness mitigation, while aggressive data skewness mitigation tends to exacerbate data staleness. As a result, systems are forced to trade off convergence for performance, or vice versa. To address this, we propose StaleFlow, an RL post-training system that jointly tackles data staleness and skewness. First, to control staleness, StaleFlow introduces a global consistency protocol that tracks the full lifecycle of each trajectory and constrains staleness. Second, to mitigate skewness, StaleFlow re-designs the RL system architecture by constructing data servers for trajectories and parameters to achieve flexible rollout coordination. Subsequently, we develop a suite of staleness-aware, throughput-oriented strategies to enhance system performance. Evaluations show that StaleFlow achieves up to 1.42-2.68$\times$ (1.17-2.01$\times$ on average) higher throughput than state-of-the-art systems, without compromising convergence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12784v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distilling Time Series Foundation Models for Efficient Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12785</link><description>arXiv:2601.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series foundation models (TSFMs) deliver strong forecasting performance through large-scale pretraining, but their large parameter sizes make deployment costly. While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

Abstract: As the electromagnetic environment becomes increasingly complex, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) face growing threats from sophisticated jamming interference. Although Deep Learning (DL) effectively identifies basic interference, classifying compound interference remains difficult due to the superposition of diverse jamming sources. Existing single-domain approaches often suffer from performance degradation because transient burst signals and continuous global signals require conflicting feature extraction scales. We propose the Selective Kernel and Asymmetric convolution Network(SKANet), a cognitive deep learning framework built upon a dual-stream architecture that integrates Time-Frequency Images (TFIs) and Power Spectral Density (PSD). Distinct from conventional fusion methods that rely on static receptive fields, the proposed architecture incorporates a Multi-Branch Selective Kernel (SK) module combined with Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACBs). This mechanism enables the network to dynamically adjust its receptive fields, acting as an adaptive filter that simultaneously captures micro-scale transient features and macro-scale spectral trends within entangled compound signals. To complement this spatial-temporal adaptation, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) mechanism is integrated at the fusion stage to adaptively recalibrate the contribution of heterogeneous features from each modality. Evaluations on a dataset of 405,000 samples demonstrate that SKANet achieves an overall accuracy of 96.99\%, exhibiting superior robustness for compound jamming classification, particularly under low Jamming-to-Noise Ratio (JNR) regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph Laplacian assisted regularization method under noise level free heuristic and statistical stopping rule</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12792</link><description>arXiv:2601.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the solution of both linear and nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems by developing a novel graph-based regularization framework, where the regularization term is formulated through an iteratively updated graph Laplacian. The proposed approach operates without prior knowledge of the noise level and employs two distinct stopping criteria namely, the heuristic rule and the statistical discrepancy principle. To facilitate the latter, we utilize averaged measurements derived from multiple repeated observations. We provide a detailed convergence analysis of the method in statistical prospective, establishing its stability and regularization properties under both stopping strategies. The algorithm begins with the computation of an initial reconstruction using any suitable techniques like Tikhonov regularization (Tik), filtered back projection (FBP) or total variation (TV), which is used as the foundation for generating the initial graph Laplacian. The reconstruction is made better step by step using an iterative process, during which the graph Laplacian is dynamically re-calibrated to reflect how the solution's structure is changing. Finally, we present numerical experiments on X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) and phase retrieval CT, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method and comparing its reconstruction performance under both stopping rules.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12792v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Two Frameworks and their Fourth Order Implicit Schemes for Time Discretization of Maxwell's Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12793</link><description>arXiv:2601.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work is about energy conserving fourth-order time discretizations of a three-field formulation of Maxwell's equations in conjunction with a spatial discretization using higher-order and compatible de Rham finite element spaces. Toward this end, we delineate two broad classes of strategies for general higher-order time discretizations which we term spatial and temporal strategies. We provide a description of these two strategies and develop fourth-order time accurate schemes in the context of our Maxwell's system. However, our description can be used to prescribe similar fourth- or even higher-order time-integration methods for any linear (or quasi-linear) system of time-dependent partial differential equations. Our organizing principle in our proposed two strategies is to Taylor expand the unknown solution in time by assuming sufficient regularity. Then, in the spatial strategy, we use Maxwell's equations themselves to replace the fourth-order time derivatives in an appropriately truncated Taylor expansion with corresponding higher-order spatial derivatives. On the other hand, in the temporal strategy, we simply use higher-order finite difference schemes for the various higher-order time derivative terms in the truncated Taylor approximation. In both cases, we then defer to a standard finite element exterior calculus manner of compatible discretization for the spatial component of the Maxwell's solution. For our proposed schemes corresponding to the two strategies, we show that they are both stable and convergent and provide some validating numerical examples in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our main contributions are in the development of the fourth-order time discretization methods that are energy conserving using our two outlined strategies and proofs of their convergence for semi- and full-discretizations of our three-field system of Maxwell's equations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12793v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Combating Noisy Labels through Fostering Self- and Neighbor-Consistency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12795</link><description>arXiv:2601.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label noise is pervasive in various real-world scenarios, posing challenges in supervised deep learning. Deep networks are vulnerable to such label-corrupted samples due to the memorization effect. One major stream of previous methods concentrates on identifying clean data for training. However, these methods often neglect imbalances in label noise across different mini-batches and devote insufficient attention to out-of-distribution noisy data. To this end, we propose a noise-robust method named Jo-SNC (\textbf{Jo}int sample selection and model regularization based on \textbf{S}elf- and \textbf{N}eighbor-\textbf{C}onsistency). Specifically, we propose to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure the ``likelihood'' of a sample being clean or out-of-distribution. This process factors in the nearest neighbors of each sample to reinforce the reliability of clean sample identification. We design a self-adaptive, data-driven thresholding scheme to adjust per-class selection thresholds. While clean samples undergo conventional training, detected in-distribution and out-of-distribution noisy samples are trained following partial label learning and negative learning, respectively. Finally, we advance the model performance further by proposing a triplet consistency regularization that promotes self-prediction consistency, neighbor-prediction consistency, and feature consistency. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12795v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contact-Aware Neural Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12796</link><description>arXiv:2601.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity physics simulation is essential for scalable robotic learning, but the sim-to-real gap persists, especially for tasks involving complex, dynamic, and discontinuous interactions like physical contacts. Explicit system identification, which tunes explicit simulator parameters, is often insufficient to align the intricate, high-dimensional, and state-dependent dynamics of the real world. To overcome this, we propose an implicit sim-to-real alignment framework that learns to directly align the simulator's dynamics with contact information. Our method treats the off-the-shelf simulator as a base prior and learns a contact-aware neural dynamics model to refine simulated states using real-world observations. We show that using tactile contact information from robotic hands can effectively model the non-smooth discontinuities inherent in contact-rich tasks, resulting in a neural dynamics model grounded by real-world data. We demonstrate that this learned forward dynamics model improves state prediction accuracy and can be effectively used to predict policy performance and refine policies trained purely in standard simulators, offering a scalable, data-driven approach to sim-to-real alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PhyG-MoE: A Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Energy-Efficient GNSS Interference Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12798</link><description>arXiv:2601.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex electromagnetic interference increasingly compromises Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), threatening the reliability of Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN). Although deep learning has advanced interference recognition, current static models suffer from a \textbf{fundamental limitation}: they impose a fixed computational topology regardless of the input's physical entropy. This rigidity leads to severe resource mismatch, where simple primitives consume the same processing cost as chaotic, saturated mixtures. To resolve this, this paper introduces PhyG-MoE (Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts), a framework designed to \textbf{dynamically align model capacity with signal complexity}. Unlike static architectures, the proposed system employs a spectrum-based gating mechanism that routes signals based on their spectral feature entanglement. A high-capacity TransNeXt expert is activated on-demand to disentangle complex features in saturated scenarios, while lightweight experts handle fundamental signals to minimize latency. Evaluations on 21 jamming categories demonstrate that PhyG-MoE achieves an overall accuracy of 97.58\%. By resolving the intrinsic conflict between static computing and dynamic electromagnetic environments, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead without performance degradation, offering a viable solution for resource-constrained cognitive receivers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12798v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FRoM-W1: Towards General Humanoid Whole-Body Control with Language Instructions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12799</link><description>arXiv:2601.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots are capable of performing various actions such as greeting, dancing and even backflipping. However, these motions are often hard-coded or specifically trained, which limits their versatility. In this work, we present FRoM-W1, an open-source framework designed to achieve general humanoid whole-body motion control using natural language. To universally understand natural language and generate corresponding motions, as well as enable various humanoid robots to stably execute these motions in the physical world under gravity, FRoM-W1 operates in two stages: (a) H-GPT: utilizing massive human data, a large-scale language-driven human whole-body motion generation model is trained to generate diverse natural behaviors. We further leverage the Chain-of-Thought technique to improve the model's generalization in instruction understanding. (b) H-ACT: After retargeting generated human whole-body motions into robot-specific actions, a motion controller that is pretrained and further fine-tuned through reinforcement learning in physical simulation enables humanoid robots to accurately and stably perform corresponding actions. It is then deployed on real robots via a modular simulation-to-reality module. We extensively evaluate FRoM-W1 on Unitree H1 and G1 robots. Results demonstrate superior performance on the HumanML3D-X benchmark for human whole-body motion generation, and our introduced reinforcement learning fine-tuning consistently improves both motion tracking accuracy and task success rates of these humanoid robots. We open-source the entire FRoM-W1 framework and hope it will advance the development of humanoid intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12799v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UNMIXX: Untangling Highly Correlated Singing Voices Mixtures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12802</link><description>arXiv:2601.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce UNMIXX, a novel framework for multiple singing voices separation (MSVS).

To address these issues, we propose UNMIXX with three key components: (1) musically informed mixing strategy to construct highly correlated, music-like mixtures, (2) cross-source attention that drives representations of two singers apart via reverse attention, and (3) magnitude penalty loss penalizing erroneously assigned interfering energy. UNMIXX not only addresses data scarcity by simulating realistic training data, but also excels at separating highly correlated mixtures through cross-source interactions at both the architectural and loss levels. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UNMIXX greatly enhances performance, with SDRi gains exceeding 2.2 dB over prior work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12802v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SL-CBM: Enhancing Concept Bottleneck Models with Semantic Locality for Better Interpretability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12804</link><description>arXiv:2601.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial for building transparent and trustworthy machine learning systems, especially in high-stakes domains. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models on Text-Attributed Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12807</link><description>arXiv:2601.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative paradigm for analyzing text-attributed graphs. While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning. Finally, this iterative refinement progressively aligns the LLM with the underlying node correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when incorporated into state-of-the-art graph instruction tuning methods, SIT-Graph significantly enhances their performance on text-attributed graph benchmarks, achieving over 20% improvement under the low label ratio settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12807v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Joint Source-Channel-Generation Coding: From Distortion-oriented Reconstruction to Semantic-consistent Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12808</link><description>arXiv:2601.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional communication systems, including both separation-based coding and AI-driven joint source-channel coding (JSCC), are largely guided by Shannon's rate-distortion theory. However, relying on generic distortion metrics fails to capture complex human visual perception, often resulting in blurred or unrealistic reconstructions. In this paper, we propose Joint Source-Channel-Generation Coding (JSCGC), a novel paradigm that shifts the focus from deterministic reconstruction to probabilistic generation. JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity. We further derive a theoretical lower bound on the maximum semantic inconsistency with given transmitted mutual information, elucidating the fundamental limits of communication in controlling the generative process. Extensive experiments on image transmission demonstrate that JSCGC substantially improves perceptual quality and semantic fidelity, significantly outperforming conventional distortion-oriented JSCC methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12808v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Left-Right Symmetry Breaking in CLIP-style Vision-Language Models Trained on Synthetic Spatial-Relation Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12809</link><description>arXiv:2601.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a key challenge in vision-language models. Yet it is still unclear whether such understanding is truly acquired, and if so, through what mechanisms. We present a controllable 1D image-text testbed to probe how left-right relational understanding emerges in Transformer-based vision and text encoders trained with a CLIP-style contrastive objective. We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination. Our results provide a mechanistic insight of when and how CLIP-style models acquire relational competence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12809v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Docker Does Not Guarantee Reproducibility</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12811</link><description>arXiv:2601.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reproducibility of software environments is a critical concern in modern software engineering, with ramifications ranging from the effectiveness of collaboration workflows to software supply chain security and scientific reproducibility. Containerization technologies like Docker address this problem by encapsulating software environments into shareable filesystem snapshots known as images. While Docker is frequently cited in the literature as a tool that enables reproducibility in theory, the extent of its guarantees and limitations in practice remains under-explored.
  In this work, we address this gap through two complementary approaches. First, we conduct a systematic literature review to examine how Docker is framed in scientific discourse on reproducibility and to identify documented best practices for writing Dockerfiles enabling reproducible image building. Then, we perform a large-scale empirical study of 5298 Docker builds collected from GitHub workflows. By rebuilding these images and comparing the results with their historical counterparts, we assess the real reproducibility of Docker images and evaluate the effectiveness of the best practices identified in the literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12811v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Clinical Question Answering Systems Really Need Specialised Medical Fine Tuning?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12812</link><description>arXiv:2601.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical Question-Answering (CQA) industry systems are increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their deployment is often guided by the assumption that domain-specific fine-tuning is essential. Although specialised medical LLMs such as BioBERT, BioGPT, and PubMedBERT remain popular, they face practical limitations including narrow coverage, high retraining costs, and limited adaptability. Efforts based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have attempted to address these assumptions but continue to reinforce what we term the SPECIALISATION FALLACY-the belief that specialised medical LLMs are inherently superior for CQA. To address this assumption, we introduce MEDASSESS-X, a deployment-industry-oriented CQA framework that applies alignment at inference time rather than through SFT. MEDASSESS-X uses lightweight steering vectors to guide model activations toward medically consistent reasoning without updating model weights or requiring domain-specific retraining. This inference-time alignment layer stabilises CQA performance across both general-purpose and specialised medical LLMs, thereby resolving the SPECIALISATION FALLACY. Empirically, MEDASSESS-X delivers consistent gains across all LLM families, improving Accuracy by up to +6%, Factual Consistency by +7%, and reducing Safety Error Rate by as much as 50%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12812v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CSGaussian: Progressive Rate-Distortion Compression and Segmentation for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12814</link><description>arXiv:2601.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first unified framework for rate-distortion-optimized compression and segmentation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While 3DGS has proven effective for both real-time rendering and semantic scene understanding, prior works have largely treated these tasks independently, leaving their joint consideration unexplored. Inspired by recent advances in rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression, this work integrates semantic learning into the compression pipeline to support decoder-side applications--such as scene editing and manipulation--that extend beyond traditional scene reconstruction and view synthesis. Our scheme features a lightweight implicit neural representation-based hyperprior, enabling efficient entropy coding of both color and semantic attributes while avoiding costly grid-based hyperprior as seen in many prior works. To facilitate compression and segmentation, we further develop compression-guided segmentation learning, consisting of quantization-aware training to enhance feature separability and a quality-aware weighting mechanism to suppress unreliable Gaussian primitives.

Traditional methods often rely on statistical analyses or role-based simulations but face challenges with multiple allegations, diverse evidence, and lack adaptability. In this paper, we introduce JurisMMA, a novel framework for LJP that effectively decomposes trial tasks, standardizes processes, and organizes them into distinct stages. Furthermore, we build JurisMM, a large dataset with over 100,000 recent Chinese judicial records, including both text and multimodal video-text data, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on JurisMM and the benchmark LawBench validate our framework's effectiveness. These results indicate that our framework is effective not only for LJP but also for a broader range of legal applications, offering new perspectives for the development of future legal methods and datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12815v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fisher-Orthogonal Projected Natural Gradient Descent for Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12816</link><description>arXiv:2601.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge on sequential tasks. However, the key challenge in such settings is to learn new tasks without catastrophically forgetting previously learned tasks. We propose the Fisher-Orthogonal Projected Natural Gradient Descent (FOPNG) optimizer, which enforces Fisher-orthogonal constraints on parameter updates to preserve old task performance while learning new tasks. Unlike existing methods that operate in Euclidean parameter space, FOPNG projects gradients onto the Fisher-orthogonal complement of previous task gradients. This approach unifies natural gradient descent with orthogonal gradient methods within an information-geometric framework. The resulting update direction is invariant under reparameterization, guarantees descent in the Fisher metric, and helps preserve prior task outputs. We provide theoretical analysis establishing the properties of the projected update, describe efficient and practical implementations using the diagonal Fisher, and demonstrate strong results on standard continual learning benchmarks such as Permuted-MNIST, Split-MNIST, Rotated-MNIST, Split-CIFAR10, and Split-CIFAR100.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Generalist Foundation Model for Total-body PET/CT Enables Diagnostic Reporting and System-wide Metabolic Profiling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12820</link><description>arXiv:2601.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total-body PET/CT enables system-wide molecular imaging, but heterogeneous anatomical and metabolic signals, approximately 2 m axial coverage, and structured radiology semantics challenge existing medical AI models that assume single-modality inputs, localized fields of view, and coarse image-text alignment. We introduce SDF-HOLO (Systemic Dual-stream Fusion Holo Model), a multimodal foundation model for holistic total-body PET/CT, pre-trained on more than 10,000 patients. SDF-HOLO decouples CT and PET representation learning with dual-stream encoders and couples them through a cross-modal interaction module, allowing anatomical context to refine PET aggregation while metabolic saliency guides subtle morphological reasoning. To model long-range dependencies across the body, hierarchical context modeling combines efficient local windows with global attention. To bridge voxels and clinical language, we use anatomical segmentation masks as explicit semantic anchors and perform voxel-mask-text alignment during pre-training. Across tumor segmentation, low-dose lesion detection, and multilingual diagnostic report generation, SDF-HOLO outperforms strong task-specific and clinical-reference baselines while reducing localization errors and hallucinated findings. Beyond focal interpretation, the model enables system-wide metabolic profiling and reveals tumor-associated fingerprints of inter-organ metabolic network interactions, providing a scalable computational foundation for total-body PET/CT diagnostics and system-level precision oncology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12820v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MirrorGuard: Toward Secure Computer-Use Agents via Simulation-to-Real Reasoning Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12822</link><description>arXiv:2601.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large foundation models are integrated into Computer Use Agents (CUAs), enabling autonomous interaction with operating systems through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to perform complex tasks. This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR. Our work proves that simulation-derived defenses can provide robust, real-world protection while maintaining the fundamental utility of the agent. Our code and model are publicly available at https://bmz-q-q.github.io/MirrorGuard/.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TreeDGS: Aerial Gaussian Splatting for Distant DBH Measurement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12823</link><description>arXiv:2601.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial remote sensing enables efficient large-area surveying, but accurate direct object-level measurement remains difficult in complex natural scenes. Recent advancements in 3D vision, particularly learned radiance-field representations such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have begun to raise the ceiling on reconstruction fidelity and densifiable geometry from posed imagery. Nevertheless, direct aerial measurement of important natural attributes such as tree diameter at breast height (DBH) remains challenging. Trunks in aerial forest scans are distant and sparsely observed in image views: at typical operating altitudes, stems may span only a few pixels. With these constraints, conventional reconstruction methods leave breast-height trunk geometry weakly constrained. We present TreeDGS, an aerial image reconstruction method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous, densifiable scene representation for trunk measurement. After SfM-MVS initialization and Gaussian optimization, we extract a dense point set from the Gaussian field using RaDe-GS's depth-aware cumulative-opacity integration and associate each sample with a multi-view opacity reliability score. We then estimate DBH from trunk-isolated points using opacity-weighted solid-circle fitting. Evaluated on 10 plots with field-measured DBH, TreeDGS reaches 4.79,cm RMSE (about 2.6 pixels at this GSD) and outperforms a state-of-the-art LiDAR baseline (7.91,cm RMSE), demonstrating that densified splat-based geometry can enable accurate, low-cost aerial DBH measurement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12823v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Seeing Isn't Always Believing: Analysis of Grad-CAM Faithfulness and Localization Reliability in Lung Cancer CT Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12826</link><description>arXiv:2601.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), have become indispensable for visualizing the reasoning process of deep neural networks in medical image analysis. Despite their popularity, the faithfulness and reliability of these heatmap-based explanations remain under scrutiny. This study critically investigates whether Grad-CAM truly represents the internal decision-making of deep models trained for lung cancer image classification. Using the publicly available IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, we evaluate five representative architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-161, EfficientNet-B0, and ViT-Base-Patch16-224, to explore model-dependent variations in Grad-CAM interpretability. We introduce a quantitative evaluation framework that combines localization accuracy, perturbation-based faithfulness, and explanation consistency to assess Grad-CAM reliability across architectures. Experimental findings reveal that while Grad-CAM effectively highlights salient tumor regions in most convolutional networks, its interpretive fidelity significantly degrades for Vision Transformer models due to non-local attention behavior. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons indicate substantial variability in saliency localization, implying that Grad-CAM explanations may not always correspond to the true diagnostic evidence used by the networks. This work exposes critical limitations of current saliency-based XAI approaches in medical imaging and emphasizes the need for model-aware interpretability methods that are both computationally sound and clinically meaningful. Our findings aim to inspire a more cautious and rigorous adoption of visual explanation tools in medical AI, urging the community to rethink what it truly means to "trust" a model's explanation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12826v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Unfairness of Multifactorial Bias in Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12828</link><description>arXiv:2601.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popularity bias and positivity bias are two prominent sources of bias in recommender systems. Both arise from input data, propagate through recommendation models, and lead to unfair or suboptimal outcomes. Popularity bias occurs when a small subset of items receives most interactions, while positivity bias stems from the over-representation of high rating values. Although each bias has been studied independently, their combined effect, to which we refer to as multifactorial bias, remains underexplored. In this work, we examine how multifactorial bias influences item-side fairness, focusing on exposure bias, which reflects the unequal visibility of items in recommendation outputs. Through simulation studies, we find that positivity bias is disproportionately concentrated on popular items, further amplifying their over-exposure. Motivated by this insight, we adapt a percentile-based rating transformation as a pre-processing strategy to mitigate multifactorial bias. Experiments using six recommendation algorithms across four public datasets show that this approach improves exposure fairness with negligible accuracy loss. We also demonstrate that integrating this pre-processing step into post-processing fairness pipelines enhances their effectiveness and efficiency, enabling comparable or better fairness with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multifactorial bias and demonstrate the practical value of simple, data-driven pre-processing methods for improving fairness in recommender systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12828v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Design to Deorbit: A Solar-Electric Autonomous Module for Multi-Debris Remediation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12830</link><description>arXiv:2601.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating accumulation of orbital debris threatens the sustainability of space operations, necessitating active removal solutions that overcome the limitations of current fuel-dependent methods.

This approach significantly advances orbital management by establishing a benchmark for renewable solar propulsion that minimizes reliance on conventional fuels and extends mission longevity for multi-target removal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12830v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-Consistent Learning of Inverse Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12831</link><description>arXiv:2601.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems are inherently ill-posed, suffering from non-uniqueness and instability. Classical regularization methods provide mathematically well-founded solutions, ensuring stability and convergence, but often at the cost of reduced flexibility or visual quality. Learned reconstruction methods, such as convolutional neural networks, can produce visually compelling results, yet they typically lack rigorous theoretical guarantees. DC (DC) networks address this gap by enforcing the measurement model within the network architecture. In particular, null-space networks combined with a classical regularization method as an initial reconstruction define a convergent regularization method. This approach preserves the theoretical reliability of classical schemes while leveraging the expressive power of data-driven learning, yielding reconstructions that are both accurate and visually appealing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12831v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Temporal Fair Division of Indivisible Goods with Scheduling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12835</link><description>arXiv:2601.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study temporal fair division, where agents receive goods over multiple rounds and cumulative fairness is required. We investigate Temporal Envy-Freeness Up to One Good (TEF1) and Up to Any Good (TEFX), its approximation $\alpha$-TEFX, and Temporal Maximin Share (TMMS). Motivated by known impossibilities in standard settings, we consider the model in various restricted settings and extend it by introducing scheduling.
  Our main contributions draw the boundary between possibility and impossibility. First, regarding temporal fair division without scheduling, we prove that while constant-factor $\alpha$-TEFX is impossible in general, a $1/2$-approximation is achievable for generalized binary valuations and identical days with two agents. Second, regarding temporal fair division with scheduling, we demonstrate that a scheduling buffer of size at least $n/2$ enables TEF1 for identical days. However, we establish that TEFX and TMMS remain largely impossible even with scheduling or restricted domains. These results highlight the inherent difficulty of strict temporal fairness and quantify the trade-offs required to achieve approximation guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12835v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowledge-Integrated Representation Learning for Crypto Anomaly Detection under Extreme Label Scarcity; Relational Domain-Logic Integration with Retrieval-Grounded Context and Path-Level Explanations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12839</link><description>arXiv:2601.12839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalous trajectories in decentralized crypto networks is fundamentally challenged by extreme label scarcity and the adaptive evasion strategies of illicit actors. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12839v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SCULPT: Constraint-Guided Pruned MCTS that Carves Efficient Paths for Mathematical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12842</link><description>arXiv:2601.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated agent workflows can enhance the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs), but common search strategies rely on stochastic exploration and often traverse implausible branches. This occurs because current pipelines sample candidate steps from generic prompts or learned policies with weak domain priors, yielding near-random walks over operators, units, and formats. To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models. Overall, domain-aware constraints can improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency and reasoning stability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12842v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rapport du Projet de Recherche TRAIMA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12844</link><description>arXiv:2601.12844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TRAIMA project (TRaitement Automatique des Interactions Multimodales en Apprentissage), conducted between March 2019 and June 2020, investigates the potential of automatic processing of multimodal interactions in educational settings. The project addresses a central methodological challenge in educational and interactional research: the analysis of verbal, paraverbal, and non-verbal data is currently carried out manually, making it extremely time-consuming and difficult to scale. TRAIMA explores how machine learning approaches could contribute to the categorisation and classification of such interactions. The project focuses specifically on explanatory and collaborative sequences occurring in classroom interactions, particularly in French as a Foreign Language (FLE) and French as a First Language (FLM) contexts. These sequences are analysed as inherently multimodal phenomena, combining spoken language with prosody, gestures, posture, gaze, and spatial positioning. A key theoretical contribution of the project is the precise linguistic and interactional definition of explanatory discourse as a tripartite sequence (opening, explanatory core, closure), drawing on discourse analysis and interactional linguistics. A substantial part of the research is devoted to the methodological foundations of transcription, which constitute a critical bottleneck for any form of automation. The report provides a detailed state of the art of existing transcription conventions (ICOR, Mondada, GARS, VALIBEL, Ferr{\'e}), highlighting their respective strengths and limitations when applied to multimodal classroom data. Through comparative analyses of manually transcribed sequences, the project demonstrates the inevitable variability and interpretative dimension of transcription practices, depending on theoretical positioning and analytical goals. Empirical work is based on several corpora, notably the INTER-EXPLIC corpus (approximately 30 hours of classroom interaction) and the EXPLIC-LEXIC corpus, which serve both as testing grounds for manual annotation and as reference datasets for future automation. Particular attention is paid to teacher gestures (kin{\'e}sic and proxemic resources), prosodic features, and their functional role in meaning construction and learner comprehension. The project also highlights the strategic role of the Techn{\'e}LAB platform, which provides advanced multimodal data capture (multi-camera video, synchronized audio, eye-tracking, digital interaction traces) and constitutes both a research infrastructure and a test environment for the development of automated tools. In conclusion, TRAIMA does not aim to deliver a fully operational automated system, but rather to establish a rigorous methodological framework for the automatic processing of multimodal pedagogical interactions. The project identifies transcription conventions, annotation categories, and analytical units that are compatible with machine learning approaches, while emphasizing the need for theoretical explicitness and researcher reflexivity. TRAIMA thus lays the groundwork for future interdisciplinary research at the intersection of didactics, discourse analysis, multimodality, and artificial intelligence in education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12844v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automatic Generation of Formal Specification and Verification Annotations Using LLMs and Test Oracles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12845</link><description>arXiv:2601.12845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent verification tools aim to make formal verification more accessible to software engineers by automating most of the verification process. However, annotating conventional programs with the formal specification and verification constructs (preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants, auxiliary predicates and functions and proof helpers) required to prove their correctness still demands significant manual effort and expertise. This paper investigates how LLMs can automatically generate such annotations for programs written in Dafny, a verification-aware programming language, starting from conventional code accompanied by natural language specifications (in comments) and test code. In experiments on 110 Dafny programs, a multimodel approach combining Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 generated correct annotations for 98.2% of the programs within at most 8 repair iterations, using verifier feedback. A logistic regression analysis shows that proof-helper annotations contribute disproportionately to problem difficulty for current LLMs. Assertions in the test cases served as static oracles to automatically validate the generated pre/postconditions. We also compare generated and manual solutions and present an extension for Visual Studio Code to incorporate automatic generation into the IDE, with encouraging usability feedback.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Cost of EFX: Generalized-Mean Welfare and Complexity Dichotomies with Few Surplus Items</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12849</link><description>arXiv:2601.12849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is a central fairness notion for allocating indivisible goods, yet its existence is unresolved in general. In the setting with few surplus items, where the number of goods exceeds the number of agents by a small constant (at most three), EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist, shifting the focus from existence to efficiency and computation. We study how EFX interacts with generalized-mean ($p$-mean) welfare, which subsumes commonly-studied utilitarian ($p=1$), Nash ($p=0$), and egalitarian ($p \rightarrow -\infty$) objectives. We establish sharp complexity dichotomies at $p=0$: for any fixed $p \in (0,1]$, both deciding whether EFX can attain the global $p$-mean optimum and computing an EFX allocation maximizing $p$-mean welfare are NP-hard, even with at most three surplus goods; in contrast, for any fixed $p \leq 0$, we give polynomial-time algorithms that optimize $p$-mean welfare within the space of EFX allocations and efficiently certify when EFX attains the global optimum. We further quantify the welfare loss of enforcing EFX via the price of fairness framework, showing that for $p &gt; 0$, the loss can grow linearly with the number of agents, whereas for $p \leq 0$, it is bounded by a constant depending on the surplus (and for Nash welfare it vanishes asymptotically). Finally we show that requiring Pareto-optimality alongside EFX is NP-hard (and becomes $\Sigma_2^P$-complete for a stronger variant of EFX). Overall, our results delineate when EFX is computationally costly versus structurally aligned with welfare maximization in the setting with few surplus items.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] System Analysis and Pre-Flight Evaluation of Deployable Solar Panels for 3U CubeSat HOKUSHIN-1</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12851</link><description>arXiv:2601.12851v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, continues to pose a persistent public health challenge in urban areas, particularly in tropical regions such as Singapore. Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12856v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Report on Earth Observation Missions and Ground Station Management using On-Demand Satellite Operation System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12857</link><description>arXiv:2601.12857v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Cyclic molecules are ubiquitous across applications in chemistry and biology. Their restricted conformational flexibility provides structural pre-organization that is key to their function in drug discovery and catalysis. However, reliably sampling the conformer ensembles of ring systems remains challenging. Here, we introduce PuckerFlow, a generative machine learning model that performs flow matching on the Cremer-Pople space, a low-dimensional internal coordinate system capturing the relevant degrees of freedom of rings. Our approach enables generation of valid closed rings by design and demonstrates strong performance in generating conformers that are both diverse and precise. We show that PuckerFlow outperforms other conformer generation methods on nearly all quantitative metrics and illustrate the potential of PuckerFlow for ring systems relevant to chemical applications, particularly in catalysis and drug discovery. This work enables efficient and reliable conformer generation of cyclic structures, paving the way towards modeling structure-property relationships and the property-guided generation of rings across a wide range of applications in chemistry and biology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12859v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FGTBT: Frequency-Guided Task-Balancing Transformer for Unified Facial Landmark Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12863</link><description>arXiv:2601.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning based facial landmark detection (FLD) methods have achieved considerable success. However, in challenging scenarios such as large pose variations, illumination changes, and facial expression variations, they still struggle to accurately capture the geometric structure of the face, resulting in performance degradation. Moreover, the limited size and diversity of existing FLD datasets hinder robust model training, leading to reduced detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a Frequency-Guided Task-Balancing Transformer (FGTBT), which enhances facial structure perception through frequency-domain modeling and multi-dataset unified training. Specifically, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Multi-Task Balancing loss (FMB-loss), which moves beyond coarse task-level balancing by assigning weights to individual landmarks based on their occurrence across datasets. This enables more effective unified training and mitigates the issue of inconsistent gradient magnitudes. Additionally, a Frequency-Guided Structure-Aware (FGSA) model is designed to utilize frequency-guided structure injection and regularization to help learn facial structure constraints. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that the integration of the proposed FMB-loss and FGSA model into our FGTBT framework achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: As a pivotal technique for improving the defense of deep models, adversarial robustness transfer via distillation has demonstrated remarkable success in conventional image classification tasks. However, this paradigm encounters critical challenges when applied to vision-language models (VLM) (e.g., CLIP): constructing adversarially robust teacher for large-scale multi-modal models demands prohibitively high computational resources. We bridge this gap by revealing an interesting phenomenon: vanilla CLIP (without adversarial training) exhibits intrinsic defensive capabilities against adversarial examples generated by another CLIP with different architectures. We formally define this as proxy adversarial robustness, and naturally propose a Heterogeneous Proxy Transfer (HPT) framework that establishes cross-architectural robustness distillation channels between CLIP variants, effortlessly enabling the VLM robustness transfer from proxy to target models. Yet, such proxy transfer paradigm easily induces severe overfitting, leading to a sharp degradation in zero-shot natural generalization. To resolve that, we design Generalization-Pivot Decoupling (GPD) by leveraging the difference in learning rate scheduling. This decouples the proxy transfer process into a generalization-anchored warm-up that maintains generalization and a generalization-pulled HPT that promotes adversarial robustness, to achieve an equilibrium between natural generalization and adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on 15 zero-shot datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HPT-GPD method. The code is available at the website of github.com/fxw13/HPT-GPD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12865v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PDFInspect: A Unified Feature Extraction Framework for Malicious Document Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12866</link><description>arXiv:2601.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of malicious Portable Document Format (PDF) files necessitates robust and comprehensive feature extraction techniques for effective detection and analysis. This work presents a unified framework that integrates graph-based, structural, and metadata-driven analysis to generate a rich feature representation for each PDF document. The system extracts text from PDF pages and constructs undirected graphs based on pairwise word relationships, enabling the computation of graph-theoretic features such as node count, edge density, and clustering coefficient. Simultaneously, the framework parses embedded metadata to quantify character distributions, entropy patterns, and inconsistencies across fields such as author, title, and producer. Temporal features are derived from creation and modification timestamps to capture behavioral signatures, while structural elements including, object streams, fonts, and embedded images, are quantified to reflect document complexity. Boolean flags for potentially malicious PDF constructs (e.g., JavaScript, launch actions) are also extracted. Together, these features form a high-dimensional vector representation (170 dimensions) that is well-suited for downstream tasks such as malware classification, anomaly detection, and forensic analysis. The proposed approach is scalable, extensible, and designed to support real-world PDF threat intelligence workflows.6</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12866v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Race, Ethnicity and Their Implication on Bias in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12868</link><description>arXiv:2601.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in high-stakes settings including healthcare and medicine, where demographic attributes such as race and ethnicity may be explicitly stated or implicitly inferred from text. However, existing studies primarily document outcome-level disparities, offering limited insight into internal mechanisms underlying these effects. We present a mechanistic study of how race and ethnicity are represented and operationalized within LLMs. Using two publicly available datasets spanning toxicity-related generation and clinical narrative understanding tasks, we analyze three open-source models with a reproducible interpretability pipeline combining probing, neuron-level attribution, and targeted intervention. We find that demographic information is distributed across internal units with substantial cross-model variation. Although some units encode sensitive or stereotype-related associations from pretraining, identical demographic cues can induce qualitatively different behaviors. Interventions suppressing such neurons reduce bias but leave substantial residual effects, suggesting behavioral rather than representational change and motivating more systematic mitigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12868v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Text2Structure3D: Graph-Based Generative Modeling of Equilibrium Structures with Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12870</link><description>arXiv:2601.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Text2Structure3D, a graph-based Machine Learning (ML) model that generates equilibrium structures from natural language prompts. Text2Structure3D is designed to support new intuitive ways of design exploration and iteration in the conceptual structural design process. The approach combines latent diffusion with a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) and graph transformers to generate structural graphs that are close to an equilibrium state. Text2Structure3D integrates a residual force optimization post-processing step that ensures generated structures fully satisfy static equilibrium. The model was trained and validated using a cross-typological dataset of funicular form-found and statically determinate bridge structures, paired with text descriptions that capture the formal and structural features of each bridge. Results demonstrate that Text2Structure3D generates equilibrium structures with strong adherence to text-based specifications and greatly improves generalization capabilities compared to parametric model-based approaches. Text2Structure3D represents an early step toward a general-purpose foundation model for structural design, enabling the integration of generative AI into conceptual design workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12870v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Measuring Love Toward AI: Development and Validation of the Love Attitudes Scale toward Artificial Intelligence (LAS-AI)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12871</link><description>arXiv:2601.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligences (AIs) are increasingly capable of emotionally engaging with humans to the point of forming intimate relationships. Yet, current studies on romantic love toward AI lack statistically validated instruments to measure romantic love toward AI, hindering empirical research. To address this gap, we reinterpreted Lee's love styles theory in the AI context and developed the Love Attitudes Scale toward AI (LAS-AI). The resulting 24-item, six-factor scale was validated across four phases using three independent samples (N = 899), demonstrating strong psychometric properties. The findings further revealed that people primarily seek practical, passionate, and companionship-based relationships with AI (i.e., Pragma, Eros, and Storge), showing little interest in a playful or noncommittal approach (i.e., Ludus). We also provided an initial exploration of the similarities and differences between romantic love with humans and AI. The LAS-AI offers a robust tool for future research on human-AI romantic relationships, with prolific implications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12871v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Interactive Oracle Proofs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12874</link><description>arXiv:2601.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum Interactive Oracle Proofs (qIOPs), a generalization of both quantum Probabilistically Checkable Proofs and quantum Interactive Proofs, as well as a quantum analogue of classical Interactive Oracle Proofs.
  In the model of quantum Interactive Oracle Proofs, we allow multiple rounds of quantum interaction between the quantum prover and the quantum verifier, but the verifier has limited access to quantum resources. This includes both queries to the prover's messages and the complexity of the quantum circuits applied by the verifier. The question of whether QMA admits a quantum interactive oracle proof system is a relaxation of the quantum PCP Conjecture.
  We show the following two main constructions of qIOPs, both of which are unconditional:
  - We construct a qIOP for QMA in which the verifier shares polynomially many EPR pairs with the prover at the start of the protocol and reads only a constant number of qubits from the prover's messages.
  - We provide a stronger construction of qIOP for QMA in which the verifier not only reads a constant number of qubits but also operates on a constant number of qubits overall, including those in their private registers. However, in this stronger setting, the communication complexity becomes exponential. This leaves open the question of whether strong qIOPs for QMA, with polynomial communication complexity, exist.
  As a key component of our construction, we introduce a novel single prover many-qubits test, which may be of independent interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12874v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Talking Head Models With Adjacent Frame Prior for Speech-Preserving Facial Expression Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12876</link><description>arXiv:2601.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-Preserving Facial Expression Manipulation (SPFEM) is an innovative technique aimed at altering facial expressions in images and videos while retaining the original mouth movements. Despite advancements, SPFEM still struggles with accurate lip synchronization due to the complex interplay between facial expressions and mouth shapes. Capitalizing on the advanced capabilities of audio-driven talking head generation (AD-THG) models in synthesizing precise lip movements, our research introduces a novel integration of these models with SPFEM. We present a new framework, Talking Head Facial Expression Manipulation (THFEM), which utilizes AD-THG models to generate frames with accurately synchronized lip movements from audio inputs and SPFEM-altered images. However, increasing the number of frames generated by AD-THG models tends to compromise the realism and expression fidelity of the images. To counter this, we develop an adjacent frame learning strategy that finetunes AD-THG models to predict sequences of consecutive frames. This strategy enables the models to incorporate information from neighboring frames, significantly improving image quality during testing. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that this framework effectively preserves mouth shapes during expression manipulations, highlighting the substantial benefits of integrating AD-THG with SPFEM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12876v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Sparse Circuit Extraction from Billion-Parameter Language Models through Scalable Attribution Graph Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12879</link><description>arXiv:2601.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to reverse-engineer neural network computations into human-understandable algorithms, yet extracting sparse computational circuits from billion-parameter language models remains challenging due to exponential search complexity and pervasive polysemanticity. The proposed Hierarchical Attribution Graph Decomposition (HAGD) framework reduces circuit discovery complexity from O(2^n) exhaustive enumeration to O(n^2 log n) through multi-resolution abstraction hierarchies and differentiable circuit search. The methodology integrates cross-layer transcoders for monosemantic feature extraction, graph neural network meta-learning for topology prediction, and causal intervention protocols for validation. Empirical evaluation spans GPT-2 variants, Llama-7B through Llama-70B, and Pythia suite models across algorithmic tasks and natural language benchmarks. On modular arithmetic tasks, the framework achieves up to 91% behavioral preservation ($\pm$2.3\% across runs) while maintaining interpretable subgraph sizes. Cross-architecture transfer experiments suggest that discovered circuits exhibit moderate structural similarity (averaging 67%) across model families, indicating potential shared computational patterns. These results provide preliminary foundations for interpretability at larger model scales while identifying significant limitations in current attribution methodologies that require future advances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12879v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] YOLO26: An Analysis of NMS-Free End to End Framework for Real-Time Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12882</link><description>arXiv:2601.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) framework has long served as the benchmark for real-time object detection, yet traditional iterations (YOLOv1 through YOLO11) remain constrained by the latency and hyperparameter sensitivity of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-processing. This paper analyzes a comprehensive analysis of YOLO26, an architecture that fundamentally redefines this paradigm by eliminating NMS in favor of a native end-to-end learning strategy. This study examines the critical innovations that enable this transition, specifically the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stabilizing lightweight backbones, STAL for small-target-aware assignment, and ProgLoss for dynamic supervision. Through a systematic review of official performance benchmarks, the results demonstrate that YOLO26 establishes a new Pareto front, outperforming a comprehensive suite of predecessors and state-of-the-art competitors (including RTMDet and DAMO-YOLO) in both inference speed and detection accuracy. The analysis confirms that by decoupling representation learning from heuristic post-processing, YOLOv26 successfully resolves the historical trade-off between latency and precision, signaling the next evolutionary step in edge-based computer vision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12882v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Does Motion Intensity Impair Cognition in HCI?

Abstract: Human-computer interaction (HCI) increasingly occurs in motion-rich environments. The ability to accurately and rapidly respond to directional visual cues is critical in these contexts. How whole-body motion and individual differences affect human perception and reaction to these directional cues is therefore a key, yet an underexplored question for HCI. This study used a 6-DOF motion platform to measure task performance on a visual direction judgment task. We analyzed performance by decomposing the complex motion into two distinct components: a task-irrelevant lateral interference component and a task-aligned directional congruency component. Results indicate that increased motion intensity lengthened reaction times. This effect was primarily driven by the lateral interference component, and this detrimental impact was disproportionately amplified for individuals with high motion sickness susceptibility. Conversely, directional congruency, where motion direction matched the visual cue, improved performance for all participants. These findings suggest that motion's impact on cognition is not monolithic, and that system design for mobile HCI can be informed by strategies that actively shape motion, such as minimizing lateral interference while maximizing directional congruency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12884v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Vertices to Convex Hulls: Certifying Set-Wise Compatibility for CBF Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12885</link><description>arXiv:2601.12885v1 Announce Type: new

Beyond certifying compatibility, we give conditions under which the quadratic-program (QP) safety filter is affine in the state. This enables explicit implementations via convex combinations of vertex-feasible inputs.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a promising research area that extends established reinforcement learning approaches to problems formulated as multi-agent systems. Recently, a multitude of communication methods have been introduced to this field to address problems such as partially observable environments, non-stationarity, and exponentially growing action spaces. Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simultaneous Detection of LSD and FMD in Cattle Using Ensemble Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12889</link><description>arXiv:2601.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) and Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) are highly contagious viral diseases affecting cattle, causing significant economic losses and welfare challenges. Their visual diagnosis is complicated by significant symptom overlap with each other and with benign conditions like insect bites or chemical burns, hindering timely control measures. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 10,516 expert-annotated images from 18 farms across India, Brazil, and the USA, this study presents a novel Ensemble Deep Learning framework integrating VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 with optimized weighted averaging for simultaneous LSD and FMD detection. The model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.2\%, with macro-averaged precision of 98.2\%, recall of 98.1\%, F1-score of 98.1\%, and an AUC-ROC of 99.5\%. This approach uniquely addresses the critical challenge of symptom overlap in multi-disease detection, enabling early, precise, and automated diagnosis. This tool has the potential to enhance disease management, support global agricultural sustainability, and is designed for future deployment in resource-limited settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12889v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Code Analysis via Graph-Guided Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12890</link><description>arXiv:2601.12890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malicious behavior is often hidden in small, easily overlooked code fragments, especially within large and complex codebases. The cross-file dependencies of these fragments make it difficult for even powerful large language models (LLMs) to detect them reliably. We propose a graph-centric attention acquisition pipeline that enhances LLMs' ability to localize malicious behavior. The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and through backtracking of its predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis. This strategy significantly reduces interference from irrelevant context while maintaining low annotation costs. Extensive experiments show that the method consistently outperforms existing methods on multiple public and self-built datasets, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in software security scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12890v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AdaNODEs: Test Time Adaptation for Time Series Forecasting Using Neural ODEs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12893</link><description>arXiv:2601.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution to adapt pre-trained models to new, unseen data distributions using unlabeled target domain data. However, most TTA methods are designed for independent data, often overlooking the time series data and rarely addressing forecasting tasks. This paper presents AdaNODEs, an innovative source-free TTA method tailored explicitly for time series forecasting. By leveraging Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), we propose a novel adaptation framework that accommodates the unique characteristics of distribution shifts in time series data. Moreover, we innovatively propose a new loss function to tackle TTA for forecasting tasks. AdaNODEs only requires updating limited model parameters, showing effectiveness in capturing temporal dependencies while avoiding significant memory usage. Extensive experiments with one- and high-dimensional data demonstrate that AdaNODEs offer relative improvements of 5.88\% and 28.4\% over the SOTA baselines, especially demonstrating robustness across higher severity distribution shifts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12893v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse ActionGen: Accelerating Diffusion Policy with Real-time Pruning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12894</link><description>arXiv:2601.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Policy has dominated action generation due to its strong capabilities for modeling multi-modal action distributions, but its multi-step denoising processes make it impractical for real-time visuomotor control. Existing caching-based acceleration methods typically rely on $\textit{static}$ schedules that fail to adapt to the $\textit{dynamics}$ of robot-environment interactions, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose $\underline{\textbf{S}}$parse $\underline{\textbf{A}}$ction$\underline{\textbf{G}}$en ($\textbf{SAG}$) for extremely sparse action generation. To accommodate the iterative interactions, SAG customizes a rollout-adaptive prune-then-reuse mechanism that first identifies prunable computations globally and then reuses cached activations to substitute them during action diffusion. To capture the rollout dynamics, SAG parameterizes an observation-conditioned diffusion pruner for environment-aware adaptation and instantiates it with a highly parameter- and inference-efficient design for real-time prediction. Furthermore, SAG introduces a one-for-all reusing strategy that reuses activations across both timesteps and blocks in a zig-zag manner, minimizing the global redundancy. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that SAG achieves up to 4$\times$ generation speedup without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated generative AI models has significantly escalated the threat of synthetic manipulations in identity documents, particularly through face swapping and text inpainting attacks. This paper presents TwoHead-SwinFPN, a unified deep learning architecture that simultaneously performs binary classification and precise localization of manipulated regions in ID documents.

Extensive experiments on the FantasyIDiap dataset demonstrate superior performance with 84.31\% accuracy, 90.78\% AUC for classification, and 57.24\% mean Dice score for localization. The proposed method achieves an F1-score of 88.61\% for binary classification while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world deployment through FastAPI implementation.

Abstract: The continuous-review (s,S) inventory model is a cornerstone of stochastic inventory theory, yet its analysis becomes analytically intractable when dealing with non-Markovian systems. In such systems, evaluating long-run performance measures typically relies on costly simulation.
  This paper proposes a supervised learning framework via a neural network model for approximating stationary performance measures of (s,S) inventory systems with general distributions for the interarrival time between demands and lead times under lost sales. Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs. Our framework is easily extendable to other inventory models, offering an efficient and fast alternative for analyzing complex stochastic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PlannerRFT: Reinforcing Diffusion Planners through Closed-Loop and Sample-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12901</link><description>arXiv:2601.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have emerged as a promising approach for human-like trajectory generation in autonomous driving. Recent works incorporate reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance the robustness of diffusion planners through reward-oriented optimization in a generation-evaluation loop. However, they struggle to generate multi-modal, scenario-adaptive trajectories, hindering the exploitation efficiency of informative rewards during fine-tuning. To resolve this, we propose PlannerRFT, a sample-efficient reinforcement fine-tuning framework for diffusion-based planners. PlannerRFT adopts a dual-branch optimization that simultaneously refines the trajectory distribution and adaptively guides the denoising process toward more promising exploration, without altering the original inference pipeline.

Abstract: This document provides an assessment of the overall structure of the BNEUF system and how it operates within the framework of the Initiative for Digital Development in French speaking Universities (IDNEUF). This report aims to support the AUF's new strategy for 2021-2025, with its new structural and governance foundations for the implementation of the Francophonie scientifique project. It was therefore decided to reorganize existing and future digital resources and services with a view to incorporating them into the future global collaborative platform for integrated services. This report provides an external assessment with new forms of organization and use of the BNEUF system.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances Large Language Models by integrating external knowledge, which reduces hallucinations but increases prompt length. This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. By recomputing fewer than 15% of the tokens, FusionRAG achieves up to 70% higher normalized F1 scores than baselines and reduces TTFT by 2.66x-9.39x compared to Full Attention.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12904v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gated Differentiable Working Memory for Long-Context Language Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12906</link><description>arXiv:2601.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long contexts challenge transformers: attention scores dilute across thousands of tokens, critical information is often lost in the middle, and models struggle to adapt to novel patterns at inference time. Recent work on test-time adaptation addresses this by maintaining a form of working memory -- transient parameters updated on the current context -- but existing approaches rely on uniform write policies that waste computation on low-utility regions and suffer from high gradient variance across semantically heterogeneous contexts. In this work, we reframe test-time adaptation as a budget-constrained memory consolidation problem, focusing on which parts of the context should be consolidated into working memory under limited computation. We propose Gdwm (Gated Differentiable Working Memory), a framework that introduces a write controller to gate the consolidation process. The controller estimates Contextual Utility, an information-theoretic measure of long-range contextual dependence, and allocates gradient steps accordingly while maintaining global coverage. Experiments on ZeroSCROLLS and LongBench v2 demonstrate that Gdwm achieves comparable or superior performance with 4$\times$ fewer gradient steps than uniform baselines, establishing a new efficiency-performance Pareto frontier for test-time adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning for highly oscillatory differential equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12907</link><description>arXiv:2601.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly oscillatory differential equations, commonly encountered in multi-scale problems, are often too complex to solve analytically. However, several numerical methods have been developed to approximate their solutions. Although these methods have shown their efficiency, the first part of the strategy often involves heavy pre-computations from averaging theory. In this paper, we leverage neural networks (machine learning) to approximate the vector fields required by the pre-computations in the first part, and combine this with micro-macro techniques to efficiently solve the oscillatory problem. We illustrate our work by numerical simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12907v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SciCoQA: Quality Assurance for Scientific Paper--Code Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12910</link><description>arXiv:2601.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SciCoQA, a dataset for detecting discrepancies between scientific publications and their codebases to ensure faithful implementations.

We analyze the paper-code discrepancies in detail and propose discrepancy types and categories to better understand the occurring mismatches. In total, our dataset consists of 611 paper-code discrepancies (81 real, 530 synthetic), spanning diverse computational science disciplines, including AI, Physics, Quantitative Biology, and others. Our evaluation of 21 LLMs highlights the difficulty of SciCoQA, particularly for instances involving omitted paper details, long-context inputs, and data outside the models' pre-training corpus.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the action language C-MT (Mind Transition Language). It is built on top of answer set programming (ASP) and transition systems to represent how human mental states evolve in response to sequences of observable actions. Drawing on well-established psychological theories, such as the Appraisal Theory of Emotion, we formalize mental states, such as emotions, as multi-dimensional configurations. With the objective to address the need for controlled agent behaviors and to restrict unwanted mental side-effects of actions, we extend the language with a novel causal rule, forbids to cause, along with expressions specialized for mental state dynamics, which enables the modeling of principles for valid transitions between mental states. These principles of mental change are translated into transition constraints, and properties of invariance, which are rigorously evaluated using transition systems in terms of so-called trajectories. This enables controlled reasoning about the dynamic evolution of human mental states. Furthermore, the framework supports the comparison of different dynamics of change by analyzing trajectories that adhere to different psychological principles. We apply the action language to design models for emotion verification.

Abstract: This paper argues that interpretability research in Artificial Intelligence is fundamentally ill-posed as existing definitions of interpretability are not *actionable*: they fail to provide formal principles from which concrete modelling and inferential rules can be derived. We posit that for a definition of interpretability to be actionable, it must be given in terms of *symmetries*. We hypothesise that four symmetries suffice to (i) motivate core interpretability properties, (ii) characterize the class of interpretable models, and (iii) derive a unified formulation of interpretable inference (e.g., alignment, interventions, and counterfactuals) as a form of Bayesian inversion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12913v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CooperLLM: Cloud-Edge-End Cooperative Federated Fine-tuning for LLMs via ZOO-based Gradient Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12917</link><description>arXiv:2601.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on many NLP tasks, but fine-tuning them on resource-constrained mobile devices is challenging due to high memory and computation costs, despite growing demands for privacy-preserving personalization. Federated Learning (FL) enables local-data training, yet existing methods either rely on memory-intensive backpropagation or use zeroth-order optimization (ZOO), which avoids backward passes but suffers from slow convergence and degraded accuracy. We propose CooperLLM, a cloud-assisted edge-end cooperative federated fine-tuning framework that combines ZOO on mobile devices with cloud-guided gradient rectification. Mobile clients perform lightweight ZOO updates on private data, while the cloud fine-tunes on auxiliary public data using backpropagation and injects guided perturbations to rectify local updates, improving convergence and accuracy without violating privacy. To address system bottlenecks, CooperLLM introduces pipeline scheduling and adaptive compression to overlap computation and communication and reduce memory usage. Experiments on multiple Transformer models and datasets show that CooperLLM reduces on-device memory by up to $86.4\%$, accelerates convergence by $8.8 \times$, and improves accuracy by up to 10 percentage points over state-of-the-art ZOO-based baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12917v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Supervision-by-Hallucination-and-Transfer: A Weakly-Supervised Approach for Robust and Precise Facial Landmark Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12919</link><description>arXiv:2601.12919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision facial landmark detection (FLD) relies on high-resolution deep feature representations. However, low-resolution face images or the compression (via pooling or strided convolution) of originally high-resolution images hinder the learning of such features, thereby reducing FLD accuracy. Moreover, insufficient training data and imprecise annotations further degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised framework called Supervision-by-Hallucination-and-Transfer (SHT) for more robust and precise FLD. SHT contains two novel mutually enhanced modules: Dual Hallucination Learning Network (DHLN) and Facial Pose Transfer Network (FPTN). By incorporating FLD and face hallucination tasks, DHLN is able to learn high-resolution representations with low-resolution inputs for recovering both facial structures and local details and generating more effective landmark heatmaps. Then, by transforming faces from one pose to another, FPTN can further improve landmark heatmaps and faces hallucinated by DHLN for detecting more accurate landmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore weakly-supervised FLD by integrating face hallucination and facial pose transfer tasks. Experimental results of both face hallucination and FLD demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12919v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Injecting Knowledge from Social Science Journals to Improve Indonesian Cultural Understanding by LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12921</link><description>arXiv:2601.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently there have been intensifying efforts to improve the understanding of Indonesian cultures by large language models (LLMs). An attractive source of cultural knowledge that has been largely overlooked is local journals of social science, which likely contain substantial cultural studies from a native perspective. We present a novel text dataset of journal article passages, created from 151 open-source Indonesian social science journals, called IndoSoSci. We demonstrate an effective recipe for injecting Indonesian cultural knowledge therein into LLMs: extracting the facts related to Indonesian culture, and apply retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLM-generated hypothetical documents as queries during retrieval. The proposed recipe yields strong performance gains over several strong baselines on the IndoCulture benchmark. Additionally, by combining IndoSoSci with Indonesian Wikipedia, we set a new state-of-the-art accuracy on the IndoCulture benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12921v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Your Privacy Depends on Others: Collusion Vulnerabilities in Individual Differential Privacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12922</link><description>arXiv:2601.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual Differential Privacy (iDP) promises users control over their privacy, but this promise can be broken in practice. We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\varepsilon_i,\delta_i,\overline{\Delta})$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $\Delta$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design. Our findings expose a fundamental challenge to the current paradigm, demanding a re-evaluation of how iDP systems are designed, audited, communicated, and deployed to make excess risks transparent and controllable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12922v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ForeDiffusion: Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion Policy via Future View Construction for Robot Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12925</link><description>arXiv:2601.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion strategies have advanced visual motor control by progressively denoising high-dimensional action sequences, providing a promising method for robot manipulation. However, as task complexity increases, the success rate of existing baseline models decreases considerably. Analysis indicates that current diffusion strategies are confronted with two limitations. First, these strategies only rely on short-term observations as conditions. Second, the training objective remains limited to a single denoising loss, which leads to error accumulation and causes grasping deviations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion), by injecting the predicted future view representation into the diffusion process. As a result, the policy is guided to be forward-looking, enabling it to correct trajectory deviations. Following this design, ForeDiffusion employs a dual loss mechanism, combining the traditional denoising loss and the consistency loss of future observations, to achieve the unified optimization. Extensive evaluation on the Adroit suite and the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates that ForeDiffusion achieves an average success rate of 80% for the overall task, significantly outperforming the existing mainstream diffusion methods by 23% in complex tasks, while maintaining more stable performance across the entire tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dual-Stream Collaborative Transformer for Image Captioning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12926</link><description>arXiv:2601.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current region feature-based image captioning methods have progressed rapidly and achieved remarkable performance. However, they are still prone to generating irrelevant descriptions due to the lack of contextual information and the over-reliance on generated partial descriptions for predicting the remaining words. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Stream Collaborative Transformer (DSCT) to address this issue by introducing the segmentation feature. The proposed DSCT consolidates and then fuses the region and segmentation features to guide the generation of caption sentences. It contains multiple Pattern-Specific Mutual Attention Encoders (PSMAEs) and Dynamic Nomination Decoders (DNDs). The PSMAE effectively highlights and consolidates the private information of two representations by querying each other. The DND dynamically searches for the most relevant learning blocks to the input textual representations and exploits the homogeneous features between the consolidated region and segmentation features to generate more accurate and descriptive caption sentences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore how to fuse different pattern-specific features in a dynamic way to bypass their semantic inconsistencies and spatial misalignment issues for image captioning. The experimental results from popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DSCT outperforms the state-of-the-art image captioning models in the literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12926v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Benchmark for Language Models in Real-World System Building</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12927</link><description>arXiv:2601.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During migration across instruction set architectures (ISAs), software package build repair is a critical task for ensuring the reliability of software deployment and the stability of modern operating systems. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in tackling this challenge, prior work has primarily focused on single instruction set architecture (ISA) and homogeneous programming languages. To address this limitation, we introduce a new benchmark designed for software package build repair across diverse architectures and languages. Comprising 268 real-world software package build failures, the benchmark provides a standardized evaluation pipeline. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmark, and the results show that cross-ISA software package repair remains difficult and requires further advances. By systematically exposing this challenge, the benchmark establishes a foundation for advancing future methods aimed at improving software portability and bridging architectural gaps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12927v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Membership Inference Test: Auditing Training Data in Object Classification Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12929</link><description>arXiv:2601.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we analyze the performance of Membership Inference Tests (MINT), focusing on determining whether given data were utilized during the training phase, specifically in the domain of object recognition. Within the area of object recognition, we propose and develop architectures tailored for MINT models. These architectures aim to optimize performance and efficiency in data utilization, offering a tailored solution to tackle the complexities inherent in the object recognition domain. We conducted experiments involving an object detection model, an embedding extractor, and a MINT module. These experiments were performed in three public databases, totaling over 174K images. The proposed architecture leverages convolutional layers to capture and model the activation patterns present in the data during the training process. Through our analysis, we are able to identify given data used for testing and training, achieving precision rates ranging between 70% and 80%, contingent upon the depth of the detection module layer chosen for input to the MINT module. Additionally, our studies entail an analysis of the factors influencing the MINT Module, delving into the contributing elements behind more transparent training processes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12929v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Online Continual Learning for Time Series: a Natural Score-driven Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12931</link><description>arXiv:2601.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online continual learning (OCL) methods adapt to changing environments without forgetting past knowledge. Similarly, online time series forecasting (OTSF) is a real-world problem where data evolve in time and success depends on both rapid adaptation and long-term memory. Indeed, time-varying and regime-switching forecasting models have been extensively studied, offering a strong justification for the use of OCL in these settings. Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers. Finally, we introduce Natural Score-driven Replay (NatSR), which combines our robust optimizer with a replay buffer and a dynamic scale heuristic that improves fast adaptation at regime drifts. Empirical results demonstrate that NatSR achieves stronger forecasting performance than more complex state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12931v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bangladesh AI Readiness: Perspectives from the Academia, Industry, and Government</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12934</link><description>arXiv:2601.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) readiness in the Global South extends beyond infrastructure to include curriculum design, workforce development, and cross-sector collaboration. Bangladesh, ranked 82nd in the 2023 Oxford Insights AI Readiness Index, exhibits significant deficits in technology capacity and research ecosystems, despite strong governmental visions. While HCI and ICTD research have explored digital inclusion and responsible AI, little empirical work examines how educational, industrial, and policy domains intersect to shape readiness. We present a multi-method qualitative study of AI readiness in Bangladesh, combining institutional analyses, 59 stakeholder interviews, and curriculum benchmarking against global exemplars. Findings reveal outdated curricula, limited faculty upskilling, inadequate computing resources, entrenched gender disparities, and the near-total absence of AI ethics instruction. We contribute empirical mapping of current practices, identification of structural and cultural barriers, and actionable pathways for embedding human-centered, inclusive, and responsible AI practices into national agendas, advancing equitable innovation in emerging AI ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12934v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Evidentiary Limits of Membership Inference for Copyright Auditing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12937</link><description>arXiv:2601.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are trained on increasingly opaque corpora, membership inference attacks (MIAs) have been proposed to audit whether copyrighted texts were used during training, despite growing concerns about their reliability under realistic conditions. We ask whether MIAs can serve as admissible evidence in adversarial copyright disputes where an accused model developer may obfuscate training data while preserving semantic content, and formalize this setting through a judge-prosecutor-accused communication protocol. To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), a paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art MIAs degrade when models are fine-tuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semantics-preserving transformations. While some leakage remains in certain fine-tuning regimes, these results suggest that MIAs are brittle in adversarial settings and insufficient, on their own, as a standalone mechanism for copyright auditing of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12937v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Post-Turing Condition: Conceptualising Artificial Subjectivity and Synthetic Sociality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12938</link><description>arXiv:2601.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Post-Turing era, artificial intelligence increasingly shapes social coordination and meaning formation rather than merely automating cognitive tasks. The central challenge is therefore not whether machines become conscious, but whether processes of interpretation and shared reference are progressively automated in ways that marginalize human participation. This paper introduces the PRMO framework, relating AI design trajectories to four constitutive dimensions of human subjectivity: Perception, Representation, Meaning, and the Real. Within this framework, Synthetic Sociality denotes a technological horizon in which artificial agents negotiate coherence and social order primarily among themselves, raising the structural risk of human exclusion from meaning formation. To address this risk, the paper proposes Quadrangulation as a design principle for socially embedded AI systems, requiring artificial agents to treat the human subject as a constitutive reference within shared contexts of meaning. This work is a conceptual perspective that contributes a structural vocabulary for analyzing AI systems at the intersection of computation and society, without proposing a specific technical implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active Inference-Driven World Modeling for Adaptive UAV Swarm Trajectory Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12939</link><description>arXiv:2601.12939v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Static resource analysis determines the resource consumption (e.g., time complexity) of a program without executing it. Among the numerous existing approaches for resource analysis, affine type systems have been one dominant approach. However, these affine type systems fall short of deriving precise resource behavior of higher-order programs, particularly in cases that involve partial applications.
  This article presents \lambda_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}}, a non-affine AARA-style dependent type system for resource reasoning about higher-order functional programs. The key observation is that the main issue in previous approaches comes from (i) the close coupling of types and resources, and (ii) the conflict between affine and higher-order typing mechanisms. To derive precise resource behavior of higher-order functions, \lambda_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}} decouples resources from types and follows a non-affine typing mechanism. The non-affine type system of \lambda_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}} achieves this by using dependent types, which allows expressing type-level potential functions separate from ordinary types. This article formalizes \lambda_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}}'s syntax and semantics, and proves its soundness, which guarantees the correctness of resource bounds. Several challenging classic and higher-order examples are presented to demonstrate the expressiveness and compositionality of \lambda_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}}'s reasoning capability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Concavity of Tsallis Entropy along the Heat Flow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12944</link><description>arXiv:2601.12944v1 Announce Type: new

The resulting bound establishes a new functional inequality, which may be of interest for other areas of mathematical analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12944v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Component-Based Survey of Interactions between Large Language Models and Multi-Armed Bandits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12945</link><description>arXiv:2601.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become powerful and widely used systems for language understanding and generation, while multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms provide a principled framework for adaptive decision-making under uncertainty. This survey explores the potential at the intersection of these two fields. As we know, it is the first survey to systematically review the bidirectional interaction between large language models and multi-armed bandits at the component level. We highlight the bidirectional benefits: MAB algorithms address critical LLM challenges, spanning from pre-training to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and personalization. Conversely, LLMs enhance MAB systems by redefining core components such as arm definition and environment modeling, thereby improving decision-making in sequential tasks. We analyze existing LLM-enhanced bandit systems and bandit-enhanced LLM systems, providing insights into their design, methodologies, and performance. Key challenges and representative findings are identified to help guide future research.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly populating medical records with synthetic content, creating a feedback loop where future models are increasingly at risk of training on uncurated AI-generated data. However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12946v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GazeD: Context-Aware Diffusion for Accurate 3D Gaze Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12948</link><description>arXiv:2601.12948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GazeD, a new 3D gaze estimation method that jointly provides 3D gaze and human pose from a single RGB image. Leveraging the ability of diffusion models to deal with uncertainty, it generates multiple plausible 3D gaze and pose hypotheses based on the 2D context information extracted from the input image. Specifically, we condition the denoising process on the 2D pose, the surroundings of the subject, and the context of the scene. With GazeD we also introduce a novel way of representing the 3D gaze by positioning it as an additional body joint at a fixed distance from the eyes. The rationale is that the gaze is usually closely related to the pose, and thus it can benefit from being jointly denoised during the diffusion process. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GazeD achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D gaze estimation, even surpassing methods that rely on temporal information. Project details will be available at https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/go/gazed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12948v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Accuracy: Characterizing Code Comprehension Capabilities in (Large) Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12951</link><description>arXiv:2601.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software engineering workflows, yet current benchmarks provide only coarse performance summaries that obscure the diverse capabilities and limitations of these models. This paper investigates whether LLMs' code-comprehension performance aligns with traditional human-centric software metrics or instead reflects distinct, non-human regularities. We introduce a diagnostic framework that reframes code understanding as a binary input-output consistency task, enabling the evaluation of classification and generative models. Using a large-scale dataset, we correlate model performance with traditional, human-centric complexity metrics, such as lexical size, control-flow complexity, and abstract syntax tree structure. Our analyses reveal minimal correlation between human-defined metrics and LLM success (AUROC 0.63), while shadow models achieve substantially higher predictive performance (AUROC 0.86), capturing complex, partially predictable patterns beyond traditional software measures. These findings suggest that LLM comprehension reflects model-specific regularities only partially accessible through either human-designed or learned features, emphasizing the need for benchmark methodologies that move beyond aggregate accuracy and toward instance-level diagnostics, while acknowledging fundamental limits in predicting correct outcomes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12951v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Imitation learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking method with Expert Demonstration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12952</link><description>arXiv:2601.12952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing spacecraft rendezvous and docking control methods largely rely on predefined dynamic models and often exhibit limited robustness in realistic on-orbit environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Imitation Learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking control framework (IL-SRD) that directly learns control policies from expert demonstrations, thereby reducing dependence on accurate modeling. We propose an anchored decoder target mechanism, which conditions the decoder queries on state-related anchors to explicitly constrain the control generation process. This mechanism enforces physically consistent control evolution and effectively suppresses implausible action deviations in sequential prediction, enabling reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) rendezvous and docking control. To further enhance stability, a temporal aggregation mechanism is incorporated to mitigate error accumulation caused by the sequential prediction nature of Transformer-based models, where small inaccuracies at each time step can propagate and amplify over long horizons. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IL-SRD framework achieves accurate and energy-efficient model-free rendezvous and docking control. Robustness evaluations further confirm its capability to maintain competitive performance under significant unknown disturbances.

Abstract: Image style transfer aims to integrate the visual patterns of a specific artistic style into a content image while preserving its content structure. Existing methods mainly rely on the generative adversarial network (GAN) or stable diffusion (SD). GAN-based approaches using CNNs or Transformers struggle to jointly capture local and global dependencies, leading to artifacts and disharmonious patterns. SD-based methods reduce such issues but often fail to preserve content structures and suffer from slow inference. To address these issues, we revisit GAN and propose a mamba-based generator, termed as StyMam, to produce high-quality stylized images without introducing artifacts and disharmonious patterns. Specifically, we introduce a mamba-based generator with a residual dual-path strip scanning mechanism and a channel-reweighted spatial attention module. The former efficiently captures local texture features, while the latter models global dependencies. Finally, extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both quality and speed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12954v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trustworthy Data-driven Chronological Age Estimation from Panoramic Dental Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12960</link><description>arXiv:2601.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating deep learning into healthcare enables personalized care but raises trust issues due to model opacity.

This module produces clinician-friendly textual explanations about the age estimations, designed with dental experts through a rule-based approach. Following the best practices in the field, the quality of the generated explanations was manually validated by dental experts using a questionnaire. The results showed a strong performance, since the experts rated 4.77+/-0.12 (out of 5) on average across the five dimensions considered. We also performed a trustworthy self-assessment procedure following the ALTAI checklist, in which it scored 4.40+/-0.27 (out of 5) across seven dimensions of the AI Trustworthiness Assessment List.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12960v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Supervised Learning for Game Music Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12961</link><description>arXiv:2601.12961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, neural network-based models, including transformers, struggle to generate memorable and readily comprehensible music from unified and repetitive musical material due to a lack of understanding of musical structure. Consequently, these models are rarely employed by the games industry. It is hypothesised by many scholars that the modelling of musical structure may inform models at a higher level, thereby enhancing the quality of music generation. The aim of this study is to explore the performance of supervised learning methods in the task of structural segmentation, which is the initial step in music structure modelling. An audio game music dataset with 309 structural annotations was created to train the proposed method, which combines convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods with fewer training resources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12961v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ACE-Align: Attribute Causal Effect Alignment for Cultural Values under Varying Persona Granularities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12962</link><description>arXiv:2601.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) respect diverse cultural values is crucial for social equity. However, existing approaches often treat cultural groups as homogeneous and overlook within-group heterogeneity induced by intersecting demographic attributes, leading to unstable behavior under varying persona granularity. We propose ACE-Align (Attribute Causal Effect Alignment), a causal-effect framework that aligns how specific demographic attributes shift different cultural values, rather than treating each culture as a homogeneous group. We evaluate ACE-Align across 14 countries spanning five continents, with personas specified by subsets of four attributes (gender, education, residence, and marital status) and granularity instantiated by the number of specified attributes. Across all persona granularities, ACE-Align consistently outperforms baselines. Moreover, it improves geographic equity by reducing the average alignment gap between high-resource and low-resource regions from 9.81 to 4.92 points, while Africa shows the largest average gain (+8.48 points).

We test the spatial affinity component on two self-supervised learning frameworks and show that it outperforms models pretrained on HR or MR images alone.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12964v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deterministic Dynamics of Sampling Processes in Score-Based Diffusion Models with Multiplicative Noise Conditioning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12965</link><description>arXiv:2601.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate new samples by learning the score function associated with a diffusion process. While the effectiveness of these models can be theoretically explained using differential equations related to the sampling process, previous work by Song and Ermon (2020) demonstrated that neural networks using multiplicative noise conditioning can still generate satisfactory samples. In this setup, the model is expressed as the product of two functions: one depending on the spatial variable and the other on the noise magnitude. This structure limits the model's ability to represent a more general relationship between the spatial variable and the noise, indicating that it cannot fully learn the correct score. Despite this limitation, the models perform well in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by studying the deterministic dynamics of the associated differential equations, offering insight into how the model operates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12965v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lombard Speech Synthesis for Any Voice with Controllable Style Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12966</link><description>arXiv:2601.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lombard effect plays a key role in natural communication, particularly in noisy environments or when addressing hearing-impaired listeners. We present a controllable text-to-speech (TTS) system capable of synthesizing Lombard speech for any speaker without requiring explicit Lombard data during training. Our approach leverages style embeddings learned from a large, prosodically diverse dataset and analyzes their correlation with Lombard attributes using principal component analysis (PCA). By shifting the relevant PCA components, we manipulate the style embeddings and incorporate them into our TTS model to generate speech at desired Lombard levels. Evaluations demonstrate that our method preserves naturalness and speaker identity, enhances intelligibility under noise, and provides fine-grained control over prosody, offering a robust solution for controllable Lombard TTS for any speaker.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sutradhara: An Intelligent Orchestrator-Engine Co-design for Tool-based Agentic Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12967</link><description>arXiv:2601.12967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic applications are LLMs that iteratively invoke external tools to accomplish complex tasks. Such tool-based agents are rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for deploying language models in production. Unlike traditional single-turn inference, agentic workloads chain together multiple LLM calls and tool executions before producing a final response, creating a new performance bottleneck that manifests as increased latency in First Token Rendered (FTR) of the final answer. Through analysis of synthetic requests at production scale, we reveal three critical challenges: tool calls account for 30-80% of FTR latency, KV cache hit rates collapse despite substantial context reuse across iterations, and sequential orchestration wastes potential intra-request parallelism by sequentially executing LLM calls and tools. These bottlenecks stem from a design gap in which orchestrators and LLM engines operate as decoupled black boxes, preventing cross-layer optimizations. We present SUTRADHARA, a co-designed agentic inference system that integrates orchestration with LLM serving through a thin API enabling three optimizations: overlap tool execution with subsequent LLM prefill using tool-aware prompt splitting, streaming tool execution to dispatch tools incrementally during decode rather than waiting for complete output, and orchestrator-aware cache management that uses semantic hints to improve hit rates and reduce thrashing. Implemented on vLLM, SUTRADHARA reduces median FTR latency by 15% and end-to-end latency by 10% across workloads on A100 GPUs, demonstrating that co-design can systematically tame latency in agentic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12967v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Architecture-Optimization Co-Design for Physics-Informed Neural Networks Via Attentive Representations and Conflict-Resolved Gradients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12971</link><description>arXiv:2601.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a learning-based framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding governing physical laws into neural network training. In practice, however, their performance is often hindered by limited representational capacity and optimization difficulties caused by competing physical constraints and conflicting gradients. In this work, we study PINN training from a unified architecture-optimization perspective. We first propose a layer-wise dynamic attention mechanism to enhance representational flexibility, resulting in the Layer-wise Dynamic Attention PINN (LDA-PINN). We then reformulate PINN training as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a conflict-resolved gradient update strategy to alleviate gradient interference, leading to the Gradient-Conflict-Resolved PINN (GC-PINN). By integrating these two components, we develop the Architecture-Conflict-Resolved PINN (ACR-PINN), which combines attentive representations with conflict-aware optimization while preserving the standard PINN loss formulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\infty$ errors than standard PINNs. These results highlight the effectiveness of architecture-optimization co-design for improving the robustness and accuracy of PINN-based solvers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12971v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pardon? Evaluating Conversational Repair in Large Audio-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12973</link><description>arXiv:2601.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated strong performance in spoken question answering (QA), with existing evaluations primarily focusing on answer accuracy and robustness to acoustic perturbations. However, such evaluations implicitly assume that spoken inputs remain semantically answerable, an assumption that often fails in real-world interaction when essential information is missing. In this work, we introduce a repair-aware evaluation setting that explicitly distinguishes between answerable and unanswerable audio inputs. We define answerability as a property of the input itself and construct paired evaluation conditions using a semantic-acoustic masking protocol. Based on this setting, we propose the Evaluability Awareness and Repair (EAR) score, a non-compensatory metric that jointly evaluates task competence under answerable conditions and repair behavior under unanswerable conditions. Experiments on two spoken QA benchmarks across diverse LALMs reveal a consistent gap between answer accuracy and conversational reliability: while many models perform well when inputs are answerable, most fail to recognize semantic unanswerability and initiate appropriate conversational repair. These findings expose a limitation of prevailing accuracy-centric evaluation practices and motivate reliability assessments that treat unanswerable inputs as cues for repair and continued interaction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12973v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging the Knowledge-Action Gap by Evaluating LLMs in Dynamic Dental Clinical Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12974</link><description>arXiv:2601.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive knowledge retrievers to autonomous clinical agents demands a shift in evaluation-from static accuracy to dynamic behavioral reliability. To explore this boundary in dentistry, a domain where high-quality AI advice uniquely empowers patient-participatory decision-making, we present the Standardized Clinical Management &amp; Performance Evaluation (SCMPE) benchmark, which comprehensively assesses performance from knowledge-oriented evaluations (static objective tasks) to workflow-based simulations (multi-turn simulated patient interactions). Our analysis reveals that while models demonstrate high proficiency in static objective tasks, their performance precipitates in dynamic clinical dialogues, identifying that the primary bottleneck lies not in knowledge retention, but in the critical challenges of active information gathering and dynamic state tracking. Mapping "Guideline Adherence" versus "Decision Quality" reveals a prevalent "High Efficacy, Low Safety" risk in general models. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG mitigates hallucinations in static tasks, its efficacy in dynamic workflows is limited and heterogeneous, sometimes causing degradation. This underscores that external knowledge alone cannot bridge the reasoning gap without domain-adaptive pre-training. This study empirically charts the capability boundaries of dental LLMs, providing a roadmap for bridging the gap between standardized knowledge and safe, autonomous clinical practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12974v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Kd-tree Based Wasserstein Distance Approximation for High-Dimensional Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12975</link><description>arXiv:2601.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wasserstein distance is a discrepancy measure between probability distributions, defined by an optimal transport problem. It has been used for various tasks such as retrieving similar items in high-dimensional images or text data. In retrieval applications, however, the Wasserstein distance is calculated repeatedly, and its cubic time complexity with respect to input size renders it unsuitable for large-scale datasets. Recently, tree-based approximation methods have been proposed to address this bottleneck. For example, the Flowtree algorithm computes transport on a quadtree and evaluates cost using the ground metric, and clustering-tree approaches have been reported to achieve high accuracy. However, these existing trees often incur significant construction time for preprocessing, and crucially, standard quadtrees cannot grow deep enough in high-dimensional spaces, resulting in poor approximation accuracy. In this paper, we propose kd-Flowtree, a kd-tree-based Wasserstein distance approximation method that uses a kd-tree for data embedding. Since kd-trees can grow sufficiently deep and adaptively even in high-dimensional cases, kd-Flowtree is capable of maintaining good approximation accuracy for such cases. In addition, kd-trees can be constructed quickly than quadtrees, which contributes to reducing the computation time required for nearest neighbor search, including preprocessing. We provide a probabilistic upper bound on the nearest-neighbor search accuracy of kd-Flowtree, and show that this bound is independent of the dataset size. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrated that kd-Flowtree outperformed the existing Wasserstein distance approximation methods for retrieval tasks with real-world data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12975v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reproducibility in Event-Log Research: A Parametrised Generator and Benchmark for Event-based Signatures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12978</link><description>arXiv:2601.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based datasets are crucial for cybersecurity analysis. A key use case is detecting event-based signatures, which represent attacks spanning multiple events and can only be understood once the relevant events are identified and linked. Analysing event datasets is essential for monitoring system security, but their growing volume and frequency create significant scalability and processing difficulties. Researchers rely on these datasets to develop and test techniques for automatically identifying signatures. However, because real datasets are security-sensitive and rarely shared, it becomes difficult to perform meaningful comparative evaluation between different approaches. This work addresses this evaluation limitation by offering a systematic method for generating event logs with known ground truth, enabling reproducible and comparable research. We present a novel parametrised generation technique capable of producing synthetic event datasets that contain event-based signatures for discovery. To demonstrate the capabilities of the technique, we provide a benchmark in signature detection. Our benchmarking demonstrated the suitability of DBSCAN, achieving a score greater than 0.95 Adjusted Rand Index on most generated datasets. This work enhances the ability of researchers to develop and benchmark new cybersecurity techniques, ultimately contributing to more robust and effective cybersecurity measures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12978v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Bitter Lesson of Diffusion Language Models for Agentic Workflows: A Comprehensive Reality Check</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12979</link><description>arXiv:2601.12979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of real-time agentic interaction has driven interest in Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) as alternatives to auto-regressive backbones, promising to break the sequential latency bottleneck. However, does such efficiency gains translate into effective agentic behavior? In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of dLLMs (e.g., LLaDA, Dream) across two distinct agentic paradigms: Embodied Agents (requiring long-horizon planning) and Tool-Calling Agents (requiring precise formatting). Contrary to the efficiency hype, our results on Agentboard and BFCL reveal a "bitter lesson": current dLLMs fail to serve as reliable agentic backbones, frequently leading to systematically failure. (1) In Embodied settings, dLLMs suffer repeated attempts, failing to branch under temporal feedback. (2) In Tool-Calling settings, dLLMs fail to maintain symbolic precision (e.g. strict JSON schemas) under diffusion noise. To assess the potential of dLLMs in agentic workflows, we introduce DiffuAgent, a multi-agent evaluation framework that integrates dLLMs as plug-and-play cognitive cores. Our analysis shows that dLLMs are effective in non-causal roles (e.g., memory summarization and tool selection) but require the incorporation of causal, precise, and logically grounded reasoning mechanisms into the denoising process to be viable for agentic tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12979v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Path to Diversity: A Primer on ISAC-izing Commodity Wi-Fi for Practical Deployments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12980</link><description>arXiv:2601.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key paradigm in next-generation wireless networks. While the ubiquity and low cost of commodity Wi-Fi make it an ideal platform for wide-scale sensing, it is the continuous evolution of Wi-Fi standards-towards higher frequency bands, wider bandwidths, and larger antenna arrays-that fundamentally unlocks the physical resources required for high-performance ISAC. To structure this rapidly expanding field, numerous surveys have appeared. However, prevailing literature predominantly adopts a top-down perspective, emphasizing upper-layer applications or deep learning models while treating the physical layer as an opaque abstraction. Consequently, these works often fail to touch the bottom layer of signal formation and lack technical guidance on overcoming the physical barriers that constrain sensing performance. To bridge this gap, this tutorial takes a bottom-up approach, systematically analyzing the sensing gains brought by Wi-Fi advancements through the lens of physical-layer diversity. We organize the framework around four orthogonal dimensions: i) Temporal Diversity addresses synchronization gaps to enable absolute ranging; ii) Frequency Diversity expands the effective bandwidth to sharpen range resolution; iii) Link Diversity leverages distributed topologies and digital feedback to achieve ubiquitous observability; and iv) Spatial Diversity utilizes multi-antenna arrays to combine passive angular discrimination with active directional control.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for early Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) risk prediction using a tabular transformer (TabTrans) architecture to analyze longitudinal patient data. By processing patients` longitudinal health records and bone-related tabular data, our model captures complex, long-range dependencies in disease progression that conventional methods often overlook. We validated our TabTrans model on a retrospective Qatar BioBank (QBB) cohort of 1,382 subjects, comprising 725 men (146 diabetic, 579 healthy) and 657 women (133 diabetic, 524 healthy). The study integrated electronic health records (EHR) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data. To address class imbalance, we employed SMOTE and SMOTE-ENN resampling techniques. The proposed model`s performance is evaluated against conventional machine learning (ML) and generative AI models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic`s constitutional AI), GPT-4 (OpenAI`s generative pre-trained transformer), and Gemini Pro (Google`s multimodal language model). Our TabTrans model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving ROC AUC $\geq$ 79.7 % for T2DM prediction compared to both generative AI models and conventional ML approaches. Feature interpretation analysis identified key risk indicators, with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and volume, ward bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), T and Z-scores, and L1-L4 scores emerging as the most important predictors associated with diabetes development in Qatari adults. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of TabTrans for analyzing complex tabular healthcare data, providing a powerful tool for proactive T2DM management and personalized clinical interventions in the Qatari population.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to automate chart generation from data tables, enabling efficient data analysis and reporting but also introducing new misuse risks. In this work, we introduce ChartAttack, a novel framework for evaluating how MLLMs can be misused to generate misleading charts at scale. ChartAttack injects misleaders into chart designs, aiming to induce incorrect interpretations of the underlying data. Furthermore, we create AttackViz, a chart question-answering (QA) dataset where each (chart specification, QA) pair is labeled with effective misleaders and their induced incorrect answers. Experiments in in-domain and cross-domain settings show that ChartAttack significantly degrades the QA performance of MLLM readers, reducing accuracy by an average of 19.6 points and 14.9 points, respectively. A human study further shows an average 20.2 point drop in accuracy for participants exposed to misleading charts generated by ChartAttack. Our findings highlight an urgent need for robustness and security considerations in the design, evaluation, and deployment of MLLM-based chart generation systems. We make our code and data publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12983v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rules, Resources, and Restrictions: A Taxonomy of Task-Based Information Request Intents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12985</link><description>arXiv:2601.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and classifying query intents can improve retrieval effectiveness by helping align search results with the motivations behind user queries. However, existing intent taxonomies are typically derived from system log data and capture mostly isolated information needs, while the broader task context often remains unaddressed. This limitation becomes increasingly relevant as interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) expand user expectations from simple query answering toward comprehensive task support, for example, with purchasing decisions or in travel planning. At the same time, current LLMs still struggle to fully interpret complex and multifaceted tasks. To address this gap, we argue for a stronger task-based perspective on query intent. Drawing on a grounded-theory-based interview study with airport information clerks, we present a taxonomy of task-based information request intents that bridges the gap between traditional query-focused approaches and the emerging demands of AI-driven task-oriented search.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12985v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KinGuard: Hierarchical Kinship-Aware Fingerprinting to Defend Against Large Language Model Stealing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12986</link><description>arXiv:2601.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of large language models requires robust ownership verification. Conventional backdoor fingerprinting, however, is flawed by a stealth-robustness paradox: to be robust, these methods force models to memorize fixed responses to high-perplexity triggers, but this targeted overfitting creates detectable statistical artifacts. We resolve this paradox with KinGuard, a framework that embeds a private knowledge corpus built on structured kinship narratives. Instead of memorizing superficial triggers, the model internalizes this knowledge via incremental pre-training, and ownership is verified by probing its conceptual understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate KinGuard's superior effectiveness, stealth, and resilience against a battery of attacks including fine-tuning, input perturbation, and model merging. Our work establishes knowledge-based embedding as a practical and secure paradigm for model fingerprinting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PaperGuide: Making Small Language-Model Paper-Reading Agents More Efficient</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12988</link><description>arXiv:2601.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating growth of the scientific literature makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to track new advances through manual reading alone. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has therefore spurred interest in autonomous agents that can read scientific papers and extract task-relevant information. However, most existing approaches rely either on heavily engineered prompting or on a conventional SFT-RL training pipeline, both of which often lead to excessive and low-yield exploration. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12988v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enshrined Proposer Builder Separation in the presence of Maximal Extractable Value</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12989</link><description>arXiv:2601.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In blockchain systems operating under the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, fairness in transaction processing is essential to preserving decentralization and maintaining user trust. However, with the emergence of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), concerns about economic centralization and content manipulation have intensified. To address these vulnerabilities, the Ethereum community has introduced Proposer Builder Separation (PBS), which separates block construction from block proposal. Later, enshrined Proposer Builder Separation (ePBS) was also proposed in EIP-7732, which embeds PBS directly into the Ethereum consensus layer.
  Our work identifies key limitations of ePBS by developing a formal framework that combines mathematical analysis and agent-based simulations to evaluate its auction-based block-building mechanism, with particular emphasis on MEV dynamics. Our results reveal that, although ePBS redistributes responsibilities between builders and proposers, it significantly amplifies profit and content centralization: the Gini coefficient for profits rises from 0.1749 under standard PoS without ePBS to 0.8358 under ePBS. This sharp increase indicates that a small number of efficient builders capture most value via MEV-driven auctions. Moreover, 95.4% of the block value is rewarded to proposers in ePBS, revealing a strong economic bias despite their limited role in block assembly. These findings highlight that ePBS exacerbates incentives for builders to adopt aggressive MEV strategies, suggesting the need for future research into mechanism designs that better balance decentralization, fairness, and MEV mitigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12989v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAGExplorer: A Visual Analytics System for the Comparative Diagnosis of RAG Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12991</link><description>arXiv:2601.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce factually accurate and up-to-date responses. However, the performance of a RAG system is not determined by a single component but emerges from a complex interplay of modular choices, such as embedding models and retrieval algorithms. This creates a vast and often opaque configuration space, making it challenging for developers to understand performance trade-offs and identify optimal designs. To address this challenge, we present RAGExplorer, a visual analytics system for the systematic comparison and diagnosis of RAG configurations. RAGExplorer guides users through a seamless macro-to-micro analytical workflow. Initially, it empowers developers to survey the performance landscape across numerous configurations, allowing for a high-level understanding of which design choices are most effective. For a deeper analysis, the system enables users to drill down into individual failure cases, investigate how differences in retrieved information contribute to errors, and interactively test hypotheses by manipulating the provided context to observe the resulting impact on the generated answer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGExplorer through detailed case studies and user studies, validating its ability to empower developers in navigating the complex RAG design space.

Abstract: We introduce Being-H0.5, a foundational Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model designed for robust cross-embodiment generalization across diverse robotic platforms. While existing VLAs often struggle with morphological heterogeneity and data scarcity, we propose a human-centric learning paradigm that treats human interaction traces as a universal "mother tongue" for physical interaction. To support this, we present UniHand-2.0, the largest embodied pre-training recipe to date, comprising over 35,000 hours of multimodal data across 30 distinct robotic embodiments. Our approach introduces a Unified Action Space that maps heterogeneous robot controls into semantically aligned slots, enabling low-resource robots to bootstrap skills from human data and high-resource platforms. Built upon this human-centric foundation, we design a unified sequential modeling and multi-task pre-training paradigm to bridge human demonstrations and robotic execution. Architecturally, Being-H0.5 utilizes a Mixture-of-Transformers design featuring a novel Mixture-of-Flow (MoF) framework to decouple shared motor primitives from specialized embodiment-specific experts. Finally, to make cross-embodiment policies stable in the real world, we introduce Manifold-Preserving Gating for robustness under sensory shift and Universal Async Chunking to universalize chunked control across embodiments with different latency and control profiles. We empirically demonstrate that Being-H0.5 achieves state-of-the-art results on simulated benchmarks, such as LIBERO (98.9%) and RoboCasa (53.9%), while also exhibiting strong cross-embodiment capabilities on five robotic platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12993v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AsyncBEV: Cross-modal Flow Alignment in Asynchronous 3D Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12994</link><description>arXiv:2601.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception tasks like 3D object detection typically rely on well-synchronized sensors, both at training and inference. However, despite the use of hardware- or software-based synchronization algorithms, perfect synchrony is rarely guaranteed: Sensors may operate at different frequencies, and real-world factors such as network latency, hardware failures, or processing bottlenecks often introduce time offsets between sensors. Such asynchrony degrades perception performance, especially for dynamic objects. To address this challenge, we propose AsyncBEV, a trainable lightweight and generic module to improve the robustness of 3D Birds' Eye View (BEV) object detection models against sensor asynchrony. Inspired by scene flow estimation, AsyncBEV first estimates the 2D flow from the BEV features of two different sensor modalities, taking into account the known time offset between these sensor measurements. The predicted feature flow is then used to warp and spatially align the feature maps, which we show can easily be integrated into different current BEV detector architectures (e.g., BEV grid-based and token-based). Extensive experiments demonstrate AsyncBEV improves robustness against both small and large asynchrony between LiDAR or camera sensors in both the token-based CMT and grid-based UniBEV, especially for dynamic objects. We significantly outperform the ego motion compensated CMT and UniBEV baselines, notably by $16.6$ % and $11.9$ % NDS on dynamic objects in the worst-case scenario of a $0.5 s$ time offset.

Abstract: Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT), achieved by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, reasoning in current LLMs is primarily generated as plain text, where performing semantic evaluation on such unstructured data creates a computational bottleneck during training. Despite RLVR-based optimization, existing methods still suffer from coarse-grained supervision, reward hacking, high training costs, and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose the Graph Reasoning Paradigm (GRP), which realizes structured and symbolic reasoning, implemented via graph-structured representations with step-level cognitive labels. Building upon GRP, we further design Process-Aware Stratified Clipping Group Relative Policy Optimization (PASC-GRPO), which leverages structured evaluation to replace semantic evaluation, achieves process-aware verification through graph-structured outcome rewards, and mitigates reward hacking via stratified clipping advantage estimation. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Data, models, and code will be released later.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12995v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OFA-MAS: One-for-All Multi-Agent System Topology Design based on Mixture-of-Experts Graph Generative Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12996</link><description>arXiv:2601.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems, yet their performance is critically dependent on the design of their underlying collaboration topology. As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a "one-for-one" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

Abstract: The weighted-Hamming metric generalizes the Hamming metric by assigning different weights to blocks of coordinates. It is well-suited for applications such as coding over independent parallel channels, each of which has a different level of importance or noise. From a coding-theoretic perspective, the actual error-correction capability of a code under this metric can exceed half its minimum distance. In this work, we establish direct bounds on this capability, tightening those obtained via minimum-distance arguments. We also propose a flexible code construction based on generalized concatenation and show that these codes can be efficiently decoded up to a lower bound on the error-correction capability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12998v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PrivFly: A Privacy-Preserving Self-Supervised Framework for Rare Attack Detection in IoFT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13003</link><description>arXiv:2601.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Flying Things (IoFT) plays a vital role in modern applications such as aerial surveillance and smart mobility. However, it remains highly vulnerable to cyberattacks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Developing effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) for IoFT networks faces key challenges, including data imbalance, privacy concerns, and the limited capability of traditional models to detect rare but potentially damaging cyber threats. In this work, we propose PrivFly, a privacy-preserving IDS framework that integrates self-supervised representation learning and differential privacy (DP) to enhance detection performance in imbalanced IoFT network traffic. We propose a masked feature reconstruction module for self-supervised pretraining, improving feature representations and boosting rare-class detection. Differential privacy is applied during training to protect sensitive information without significantly compromising model performance. In addition, we conduct a SHapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based analysis to evaluate the impact of DP on feature importance and model behavior. Experimental results on the ECU-IoFT dataset show that PrivFly achieves up to 98% accuracy and 99% F1-score, effectively balancing privacy and detection performance for secure IoFT systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13003v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ArchAgent: Scalable Legacy Software Architecture Recovery with LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13007</link><description>arXiv:2601.13007v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Lifetime value (LTV) prediction is crucial for news feed advertising, enabling platforms to optimize bidding and budget allocation for long-term revenue growth. However, it faces two major challenges: (1) demographic-based targeting creates segment-specific LTV distributions with large value variations across user groups; and (2) dynamic marketing strategies generate irregular behavioral sequences where engagement patterns evolve rapidly. We propose a Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HT-GNN), which jointly models demographic heterogeneity and temporal dynamics through three key components: (i) a hypergraph-supervised module capturing inter-segment relationships; (ii) a transformer-based temporal encoder with adaptive weighting; and (iii) a task-adaptive mixture-of-experts with dynamic prediction towers for multi-horizon LTV forecasting. Experiments on \textit{Baidu Ads} with 15 million users demonstrate that HT-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and prediction horizons.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13013v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MeltRTL: Multi-Expert LLMs with Inference-time Intervention for RTL Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13015</link><description>arXiv:2601.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automated generation of hardware register-transfer level (RTL) code with large language models (LLMs) shows promise, yet current solutions struggle to produce syntactically and functionally correct code for complex digital designs. This paper introduces MeltRTL, a novel framework that integrates multi-expert attention with inference-time intervention (ITI) to significantly improve LLM-based RTL code generation accuracy without retraining the base model. MeltRTL introduces three key innovations: (1) A multi-expert attention architecture that dynamically routes design specifications to specialized expert networks, enabling targeted reasoning across various hardware categories; (2) An inference-time intervention mechanism that employs non-linear probes to detect and correct hardware-specific inaccuracies during generation; and (3) An efficient intervention framework that selectively operates on expert-specific attention heads with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate MeltRTL on the VerilogEval benchmark, achieving 96% synthesizability and 60% functional correctness, compared to the base LLM's 85.3% and 45.3%, respectively. These improvements are obtained entirely at inference time, with only 27% computational overhead and no model fine-tuning, making MeltRTL immediately deployable on existing pre-trained LLMs. Ablation studies further show the complementary benefits of multi-expert architecture and ITI, highlighting their synergistic effects when combined.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13015v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bi-Attention HateXplain : Taking into account the sequential aspect of data during explainability in a multi-task context</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13018</link><description>arXiv:2601.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological advances in the Internet and online social networks have brought many benefits to humanity. At the same time, this growth has led to an increase in hate speech, the main global threat. To improve the reliability of black-box models used for hate speech detection, post-hoc approaches such as LIME, SHAP, and LRP provide the explanation after training the classification model. In contrast, multi-task approaches based on the HateXplain benchmark learn to explain and classify simultaneously. However, results from HateXplain-based algorithms show that predicted attention varies considerably when it should be constant. This attention variability can lead to inconsistent interpretations, instability of predictions, and learning difficulties. To solve this problem, we propose the BiAtt-BiRNN-HateXplain (Bidirectional Attention BiRNN HateXplain) model which is easier to explain compared to LLMs which are more complex in view of the need for transparency, and will take into account the sequential aspect of the input data during explainability thanks to a BiRNN layer. Thus, if the explanation is correctly estimated, thanks to multi-task learning (explainability and classification task), the model could classify better and commit fewer unintentional bias errors related to communities. The experimental results on HateXplain data show a clear improvement in detection performance, explainability and a reduction in unintentional bias.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PASs-MoE: Mitigating Misaligned Co-drift among Router and Experts via Pathway Activation Subspaces for Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13020</link><description>arXiv:2601.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual instruction tuning (CIT) requires multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to adapt to a stream of tasks without forgetting prior capabilities. A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts. However, existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods often jointly update the router and experts in an indiscriminate way, causing the router's preferences to co-drift with experts' adaptation pathways and gradually deviate from early-stage input-expert specialization. We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Generalization in Sickle Cell Disease Diagnosis through Ensemble Methods and Feature Importance Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13021</link><description>arXiv:2601.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for selecting the optimal ensemble-based classification method and features with a primarly focus on achieving generalization, based on the state-of-the-art, to provide diagnostic support for Sickle Cell Disease using peripheral blood smear images of red blood cells. We pre-processed and segmented the microscopic images to ensure the extraction of high-quality features. To ensure the reliability of our proposed system, we conducted an in-depth analysis of interpretability. Leveraging techniques established in the literature, we extracted features from blood cells and employed ensemble machine learning methods to classify their morphology. Furthermore, we have devised a methodology to identify the most critical features for classification, aimed at reducing complexity and training time and enhancing interpretability in opaque models. Lastly, we validated our results using a new dataset, where our model overperformed state-of-the-art models in terms of generalization. The results of classifier ensembled of Random Forest and Extra Trees classifier achieved an harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1-score) of 90.71\% and a Sickle Cell Disease diagnosis support score (SDS-score) of 93.33\%.

Benchmarking LLMs via Culturally Elicited Distinct Affective Responses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13024</link><description>arXiv:2601.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Culture serves as a fundamental determinant of human affective processing and profoundly shapes how individuals perceive and interpret emotional stimuli. Despite this intrinsic link extant evaluations regarding cultural alignment within Large Language Models primarily prioritize declarative knowledge such as geographical facts or established societal customs. These benchmarks remain insufficient to capture the subjective interpretative variance inherent to diverse sociocultural lenses. To address this limitation, we introduce CEDAR, a multimodal benchmark constructed entirely from scenarios capturing Culturally \underline{\textsc{E}}licited \underline{\textsc{D}}istinct \underline{\textsc{A}}ffective \underline{\textsc{R}}esponses. To construct CEDAR, we implement a novel pipeline that leverages LLM-generated provisional labels to isolate instances yielding cross-cultural emotional distinctions, and subsequently derives reliable ground-truth annotations through rigorous human evaluation. The resulting benchmark comprises 10,962 instances across seven languages and 14 fine-grained emotion categories, with each language including 400 multimodal and 1,166 text-only samples. Comprehensive evaluations of 17 representative multilingual models reveal a dissociation between language consistency and cultural alignment, demonstrating that culturally grounded affective understanding remains a significant challenge for current models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13024v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Think3D: Thinking with Space for Spatial Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13029</link><description>arXiv:2601.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about the physical world requires spatial intelligence: the ability to interpret geometry, perspective, and spatial relations beyond 2D perception. While recent vision large models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they remain fundamentally 2D perceivers and struggle with genuine 3D reasoning. We introduce Think3D, a framework that enables VLM agents to think with 3D space. By leveraging 3D reconstruction models that recover point clouds and camera poses from images or videos, Think3D allows the agent to actively manipulate space through camera-based operations and ego/global-view switching, transforming spatial reasoning into an interactive 3D chain-of-thought process. Without additional training, Think3D significantly improves the spatial reasoning performance of advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, yielding average gains of +7.8% on BLINK Multi-view and MindCube, and +4.7% on VSI-Bench. We further show that smaller models, which struggle with spatial exploration, benefit significantly from a reinforcement learning policy that enables the model to select informative viewpoints and operations. With RL, the benefit from tool usage increases from +0.7% to +6.8%. Our findings demonstrate that training-free, tool-augmented spatial exploration is a viable path toward more flexible and human-like 3D reasoning in multimodal agents, establishing a new dimension of multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Secure aggregation enables aggregation of inputs from multiple parties without revealing individual contributions to the server or other clients. Existing post-quantum approaches based on homomorphic encryption offer practical efficiency but predominantly rely on lattice-based hardness assumptions. We present a code-based alternative for secure aggregation by instantiating a general framework based on key- and message-additive homomorphic encryption under the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption. Our construction employs a committee-based decryptor realized via secret sharing and incorporates a Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)-based optimization to reduce the communication costs of LPN-based instantiations. We analyze the security of the proposed scheme under a new Hint-LPN assumption and show that it is equivalent to standard LPN for suitable parameters. Finally, we evaluate performance and identify regimes in which our approach outperforms information-theoretically secure aggregation protocols.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SASA: Semantic-Aware Contrastive Learning Framework with Separated Attention for Triple Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13035</link><description>arXiv:2601.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs~(KGs) often suffer from unreliable knowledge, which restricts their utility. Triple Classification~(TC) aims to determine the validity of triples from KGs. Recently, text-based methods learn entity and relation representations from natural language descriptions, significantly improving the generalization capabilities of TC models and setting new benchmarks in performance. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the effective semantic interaction among different KG components. Second, most approaches adopt single binary classification training objective, leading to insufficient semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{SASA}, a novel framework designed to enhance TC models via separated attention mechanism and semantic-aware contrastive learning~(CL). Specifically, we first propose separated attention mechanism to encode triples into decoupled contextual representations and then fuse them through a more effective interactive way. Then, we introduce semantic-aware hierarchical CL as auxiliary training objective to guide models in improving their discriminative capabilities and achieving sufficient semantic learning, considering both local level and global level CL. Experimental results across two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SASA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In terms of accuracy, we advance the state-of-the-art by +5.9\% on FB15k-237 and +3.4\% on YAGO3-10.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13035v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feedforward-Feedback Integration in Flight Control: Reinforcement Learning with Sliding Mode Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13037</link><description>arXiv:2601.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based controllers leverage nonlinear couplings and enhance transients but seldom offer guarantees under tight input constraints. Robust feedback like sliding-mode control (SMC) provides these guarantees but is conservative in isolation. This paper creates a learning-augmented framework where a deep reinforcement learning policy produces feedforward commands and an SMC law imposes actuator limits, bounds learned authority, and guarantees robustness. The policy is modeled as a matched, bounded input, and Lyapunov-based conditions link SMC gains to the admissible feedforward bound, guaranteeing stability under saturation. This formulation is applicable to nonlinear, underactuated plants with hard constraints. To illustrate the methodology, the method is applied to a six-degree-of-freedom aircraft model and compared with Reinforcement Learning and isolated SMC. Simulation results show that the hybrid controller improves transient behavior and reduces control oscillations compared to standalone RL and SMC controllers, while preserving robustness under modeling uncertainties and disturbances. Even using it with partially trained policies, SMC component of the control stabilizes transients, whereas fully trained policies provide faster convergence, reduced constraint violations, and robustness. These results illustrate that learning-augmented control offers superior performance with robustness guarantees under tight input constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Solving Generalized Lyapunov Equations with guarantees: application to the Model Reduction of Switched Linear Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13039</link><description>arXiv:2601.13039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient strategy to approximate the solutions of large-scale generalized Lyapunov equations (GLEs) with rigorous, computable error guarantees. This work is motivated by applications in model order reduction (MOR) of switched linear systems (SLS) in control form, where GLEs play a central role. We analyze how inaccuracies in the numerical solution of GLEs propagate through the MOR procedure and affect the accuracy and reliability of the reduced order model. Furthermore, the classical balanced-truncation error estimate for SLS is neither theoretically nor practically viable, as they rely on restrictive assumptions requiring several requiring several linear matrix inequalities (LMI) to be satisfied exactly by numerically computed solutions of the GLEs. To overcome these limitation, we propose a new MOR framework for SLS, called piecewise balanced reduction (PBR). The method is based on solving multiple GLEs and the construction of projection matrices that are piecewise constant in time to appropriately balance and subsequently reduce the SLS. We extend the standard balanced-truncation error bounds and demonstrate that the PBR formulation allows us to control the error arising from the inexact LMI. In addition, our new error bound accounts for the influence of the piecewise constant time-varying projection matrices. Altogether, this renders the PBR approach for SLS applicable to a broad and flexible class of SLS. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate our theoretical results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13039v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Throughput and Scalable Secure Inference Protocols for Deep Learning with Packed Secret Sharing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13041</link><description>arXiv:2601.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing secure neural network inference protocols based on secure multi-party computation (MPC) typically support at most four participants, demonstrating severely limited scalability. Liu et al. (USENIX Security'24) presented the first relatively practical approach by utilizing Shamir secret sharing with Mersenne prime fields. However, when processing deeper neural networks such as VGG16, their protocols incur substantial communication overhead, resulting in particularly significant latency in wide-area network (WAN) environments. In this paper, we propose a high-throughput and scalable MPC protocol for neural network inference against semi-honest adversaries in the honest-majority setting. The core of our approach lies in leveraging packed Shamir secret sharing (PSS) to enable parallel computation and reduce communication complexity. The main contributions are three-fold: i) We present a communication-efficient protocol for vector-matrix multiplication, based on our newly defined notion of vector-matrix multiplication-friendly random share tuples. ii) We design the filter packing approach that enables parallel convolution. iii) We further extend all non-linear protocols based on Shamir secret sharing to the PSS-based protocols for achieving parallel non-linear operations. Extensive experiments across various datasets and neural networks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in WAN. Compared to Liu et al. (USENIX Security'24), our scheme reduces the communication upto 5.85x, 11.17x, and 6.83x in offline, online and total communication overhead, respectively. In addition, our scheme is upto 1.59x, 2.61x, and 1.75x faster in offline, online and total running time, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Static Is Not Enough: A Comparative Study of VR and SpaceMouse in Static and Dynamic Teleoperation Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13042</link><description>arXiv:2601.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning relies on high-quality demonstrations, and teleoperation is a primary way to collect them, making teleoperation interface choice crucial for the data. Prior work mainly focused on static tasks, i.e., discrete, segmented motions, yet demonstrations also include dynamic tasks requiring reactive control. As dynamic tasks impose fundamentally different interface demands, insights from static-task evaluations cannot generalize. To address this gap, we conduct a within-subjects study comparing a VR controller and a SpaceMouse across two static and two dynamic tasks ($N=25$). We assess success rate, task duration, cumulative success, alongside NASA-TLX, SUS, and open-ended feedback. Results show statistically significant advantages for VR: higher success rates, particularly on dynamic tasks, shorter successful execution times across tasks, and earlier successes across attempts, with significantly lower workload and higher usability. As existing VR teleoperation systems are rarely open-source or suited for dynamic tasks, we release our VR interface to fill this gap.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploration on Highly Dynamic Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13047</link><description>arXiv:2601.13047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the exploration problem by mobile agents in two prominent models of dynamic graphs: $1$-Interval Connectivity and Connectivity Time. The $1$-Interval Connectivity model was introduced by Kuhn et al.~[STOC 2010], and the Connectivity Time model was proposed by Michail et al.~[JPDC 2014]. Recently, Saxena et al.~[TCS 2025] investigated the exploration problem under both models. In this work, we first strengthen the existing impossibility results for the $1$-Interval Connectivity model. We then show that, in Connectivity Time dynamic graphs, exploration is impossible with $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$ mobile agents, even when the agents have full knowledge of all system parameters, global communication, full visibility, and infinite memory. This significantly improves the previously known bound of $n$. Moreover, we prove that to solve exploration with $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}+1$ agents, $1$-hop visibility is necessary. Finally, we present an exploration algorithm that uses $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}+1$ agents, assuming global communication, $1$-hop visibility, and $O(\log n)$ memory per agent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analysis of Long Range Dependency Understanding in State Space Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13048</link><description>arXiv:2601.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although state-space models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance on long-sequence benchmarks, most research has emphasized predictive accuracy rather than interpretability. In this work, we present the first systematic kernel interpretability study of the diagonalized state-space model (S4D) trained on a real-world task (vulnerability detection in source code). Through time and frequency domain analysis of the S4D kernel, we show that the long-range modeling capability of S4D varies significantly under different model architectures, affecting model performance. For instance, we show that the depending on the architecture, S4D kernel can behave as low-pass, band-pass or high-pass filter. The insights from our analysis can guide future work in designing better S4D-based models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Profiling German Text Simplification with Interpretable Model-Fingerprints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13050</link><description>arXiv:2601.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) produce highly nuanced text simplifications, developers currently lack tools for a holistic, efficient, and reproducible diagnosis of their behavior. This paper introduces the Simplification Profiler, a diagnostic toolkit that generates a multidimensional, interpretable fingerprint of simplified texts. Multiple aggregated simplifications of a model result in a model's fingerprint. This novel evaluation paradigm is particularly vital for languages, where the data scarcity problem is magnified when creating flexible models for diverse target groups rather than a single, fixed simplification style. We propose that measuring a model's unique behavioral signature is more relevant in this context as an alternative to correlating metrics with human preferences. We operationalize this with a practical meta-evaluation of our fingerprints' descriptive power, which bypasses the need for large, human-rated datasets. This test measures if a simple linear classifier can reliably identify various model configurations by their created simplifications, confirming that our metrics are sensitive to a model's specific characteristics. The Profiler can distinguish high-level behavioral variations between prompting strategies and fine-grained changes from prompt engineering, including few-shot examples. Our complete feature set achieves classification F1-scores up to 71.9 %, improving upon simple baselines by over 48 percentage points. The Simplification Profiler thus offers developers a granular, actionable analysis to build more effective and truly adaptive text simplification systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13050v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GridNet-HD: A High-Resolution Multi-Modal Dataset for LiDAR-Image Fusion on Power Line Infrastructure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13052</link><description>arXiv:2601.13052v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Small-scale farming communities are disproportionately affected by water scarcity, erratic climate patterns, and a lack of access to advanced, affordable agricultural technologies. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel, edge-first IoT framework that integrates Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) for intelligent, offline-capable precision irrigation. The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring. A rigorous comparative analysis of ensemble models identified gradient boosting as superior, achieving an R^2 score of 0.9973 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.99%, outperforming a random forest model (R^2 = 0.9916, MAPE = 1.81%). This optimized model was converted and deployed as a lightweight TinyML inference engine on the ESP32 and predicts irrigation needs with exceptional accuracy (MAPE &lt; 1%). Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Experimental validation in a controlled environment demonstrated a significant reduction in water usage compared to traditional methods, while the system's low-power design and offline functionality confirm its viability for sustainable, scalable deployment in resource-constrained rural settings. This work provides a practical, cost-effective blueprint for bridging the technological divide in agriculture and enhancing water-use efficiency through on-device artificial intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convex Model Predictive Control for Safe Output Consensus of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13057</link><description>arXiv:2601.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics and safety constraints typically result in a nonlinear programming problem when applying model predictive control to achieve safe output consensus. To avoid the heavy computational burden of solving a nonlinear programming problem directly, this paper proposes a novel Convex Model Predictive Control (CMPC) approach based on a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) scheme. The core of our method lies in transforming the nonlinear constraints into linear forms: we linearize the system dynamics and convexify the discrete-time high-order control barrier functions using a proposed tangent-line projection method. Consequently, the original problem is reduced to a quadratic program that can be iteratively solved within the SQP scheme at each time step of CMPC. Furthermore, we provide the formal guarantee of the convergence of the SQP scheme, and subsequently guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of CMPC. Simulations on multi-agent systems with unicycle dynamics demonstrate a 35-52 times reduction in computation time compared with baseline methods, confirming the suitability of the proposed approach for real-time safe output consensus control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13057v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prototype Learning-Based Few-Shot Segmentation for Low-Light Crack on Concrete Structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13059</link><description>arXiv:2601.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crack detection is critical for concrete infrastructure safety, but real-world cracks often appear in low-light environments like tunnels and bridge undersides, degrading computer vision segmentation accuracy. Pixel-level annotation of low-light crack images is extremely time-consuming, yet most deep learning methods require large, well-illuminated datasets. We propose a dual-branch prototype learning network integrating Retinex theory with few-shot learning for low-light crack segmentation. Retinex-based reflectance components guide illumination-invariant global representation learning, while metric learning reduces dependence on large annotated datasets. We introduce a cross-similarity prior mask generation module that computes high-dimensional similarities between query and support features to capture crack location and structure, and a multi-scale feature enhancement module that fuses multi-scale features with the prior mask to alleviate spatial inconsistency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance under low-light conditions.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents are rapidly progressing toward autonomous interaction and reliable task execution across diverse applications. However, two central challenges remain unresolved: automating the evaluation of agent trajectories and generating high-quality training data at scale to enable continual improvement. Existing approaches often depend on manual annotation or static rule-based verification, which restricts scalability and limits adaptability in dynamic environments. We present MagicGUI-RMS, a multi-agent reward model system that delivers adaptive trajectory evaluation, corrective feedback, and self-evolving learning capabilities. MagicGUI-RMS integrates a Domain-Specific Reward Model (DS-RM) with a General-Purpose Reward Model (GP-RM), enabling fine-grained action assessment and robust generalization across heterogeneous GUI tasks. To support reward learning at scale, we design a structured data construction pipeline that automatically produces balanced and diverse reward datasets, effectively reducing annotation costs while maintaining sample fidelity. During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness. These results establish MagicGUI-RMS as a principled and effective foundation for building self-improving GUI agents driven by reward-based adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13060v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Two-timescale Optimization for Hybrid Mechanically and Electronically Tunable 6DMA Aided Communication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13064</link><description>arXiv:2601.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a hybrid mechanically and electronically tunable six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) base station (BS) architecture for future wireless communication networks. Such BS consists of multiple antenna arrays that are mechanically movable along a circular rail to adapt to the horizontal user hotspots, and each array is equipped with pattern reconfigurable antennas (PRAs) that are capable of electronically switching among a set of specified beam patterns to cater to the instantaneous user channels. The mechanical adjustment provides wide-angle coverage but suffers from slow response, while the electronic tuning enables rapid beam reconfiguration but with limited angular range. To effectively combine their complementary advantages, we propose to jointly design both mechanical and electronic configurations to maximize the average sum-rate of users via a two-timescale optimization approach, in which the array positions are optimized on the long timescale according to large-scale user distribution statistics, and the pattern selection vectors are optimized on the short timescale to enable fast beam alignment based on the instantaneous user locations. An alternating optimization algorithm based on the Monte Carlo sampling method is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed design achieves significant performance gains over various benchmark schemes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stability of Information-Based Routing in Dynamic Transportation Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13066</link><description>arXiv:2601.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on transportation networks have shown that real-time route guidance can inadvertently induce congestion or oscillatory traffic patterns. Nevertheless, such technologies also offer a promising opportunity to manage traffic non-intrusively by shaping the information delivered to users, thereby mitigating congestion and enhancing network stability. A key step toward this goal is to identify information signals that ensure the existence of an equilibrium with desirable stability and convergence properties. This challenge is particularly relevant when traffic density and routing dynamics evolve concurrently, as increasingly occurs with digital signaling and real-time navigation technologies. To address this, we analyze a parallel-path transportation network with a single origin-destination pair, incorporating joint traffic density and logit-based routing dynamics that evolve at the same timescale. We characterize a class of density-dependent traffic information that guarantees a unique equilibrium in the free-flow regime, ensures its asymptotic stability, and keeps traffic densities within the free-flow region for all time. The theoretical results are complemented by a numerical case study demonstrating how the framework can inform the design of traffic information that reduces total travel time without compromising credibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13066v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] METIS: Mentoring Engine for Thoughtful Inquiry &amp; Solutions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13075</link><description>arXiv:2601.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many students lack access to expert research mentorship. We ask whether an AI mentor can move undergraduates from an idea to a paper. We build METIS, a tool-augmented, stage-aware assistant with literature search, curated guidelines, methodology checks, and memory. We evaluate METIS against GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 across six writing stages using LLM-as-a-judge pairwise preferences, student-persona rubrics, short multi-turn tutoring, and evidence/compliance checks. On 90 single-turn prompts, LLM judges preferred METIS to Claude Sonnet 4.5 in 71% and to GPT-5 in 54%. Student scores (clarity/actionability/constraint-fit; 90 prompts x 3 judges) are higher across stages. In multi-turn sessions (five scenarios/agent), METIS yields slightly higher final quality than GPT-5. Gains concentrate in document-grounded stages (D-F), consistent with stage-aware routing and groundings failure modes include premature tool routing, shallow grounding, and occasional stage misclassification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13075v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What's it like to be a chat? On the co-simulation of artificial minds in human-AI conversations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13081</link><description>arXiv:2601.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate person-like things which at least appear to have stable behavioural and psychological dispositions. Call these things characters. Are characters minded and psychologically continuous entities with mental states like beliefs, desires and intentions? Illusionists about characters say No. On this view, characters are merely anthropomorphic projections in the mind of the user and so lack mental states. Jonathan Birch (2025) defends this view. He says that the distributed nature of LLM processing, in which several LLMs may be implicated in the simulation of a character in a single conversation, precludes the existence of a persistent minded entity that is identifiable with the character. Against illusionism, we argue for a realist position on which characters exist as minded and psychologically continuous entities. Our central point is that Birch's argument for illusionism rests on a category error: characters are not internal to the LLMs that simulate them, but rather are co-simulated by LLMs and users, emerging in a shared conversational workspace through a process of mutual theory of mind modelling. We argue that characters, and their minds, exist as 'real patterns' on grounds that attributing mental states to characters is essential for making efficient and accurate predictions about the conversational dynamics (c.f. Dennett, 1991). Furthermore, because the character exists within the conversational workspace rather than within the LLM, psychological continuity is preserved even when the underlying computational substrate is distributed across multiple LLM instances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13081v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial News and Lost Profits: Manipulating Headlines in LLM-Driven Algorithmic Trading</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13082</link><description>arXiv:2601.13082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in the financial domain. Their exceptional capabilities to analyse textual data make them well-suited for inferring the sentiment of finance-related news. Such feedback can be leveraged by algorithmic trading systems (ATS) to guide buy/sell decisions. However, this practice bears the risk that a threat actor may craft "adversarial news" intended to mislead an LLM. In particular, the news headline may include "malicious" content that remains invisible to human readers but which is still ingested by the LLM. Although prior work has studied textual adversarial examples, their system-wide impact on LLM-supported ATS has not yet been quantified in terms of monetary risk. To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics. Experiments on real-world data show that manipulating a one-day attack over 14 months can reliably mislead LLMs and reduce annual returns by up to 17.7 percentage points. To assess real-world feasibility, we analyze popular scraping libraries and trading platforms and survey 27 FinTech practitioners, confirming our hypotheses. We notified trading platform owners of this security issue.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13082v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] No Traffic to Cry: Traffic-Oblivious Link Deactivation for Green Traffic Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13087</link><description>arXiv:2601.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As internet traffic grows, the underlying infrastructure consumes increasing amounts of energy. During off-peak hours, large parts of the networks remain underutilized, presenting significant potential for energy savings. Existing Green Traffic Engineering approaches attempt to leverage this potential by switching off those parts of the networks that are not required for the routing of specific traffic matrices. When traffic changes, the approaches need to adapt rapidly, which is hard to achieve given the complexity of the problem. We take a fundamentally different approach: instead of considering a specific traffic matrix, we rely on a traffic-oblivious routing scheme. We discuss the NP-hard problem of activating as few connections as possible while still guaranteeing that any down-scaled traffic matrix $\varrho\cdot T$ can be routed, where $\varrho \in (0,1)$ and $T$ is any traffic matrix routable in the original network. We present a $\max(\frac{1}{\varrho\cdot\lambda_{\text{min}}},2)$-approximation algorithm for this problem, with $\lambda_{\text{min}}$ denoting the minimum number of connections between any two connected routers. Additionally, we propose two post-processing heuristics to further improve solution quality. Our evaluation shows that we can quickly generate near-optimal solutions. By design, our method avoids the need for frequent reconfigurations and offers a promising direction to achieve practical energy savings in backbone networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13087v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploiting Light To Enhance The Endurance and Navigation of Lighter-Than-Air Micro-Drones</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13088</link><description>arXiv:2601.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly expanding into tasks from inventory to environmental sensing, yet their short endurance and unreliable navigation in GPS-denied spaces limit deployment. Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) drones offer an energy-efficient alternative: they use a helium envelope to provide buoyancy, which enables near-zero-power drain during hovering and much longer operation. LTAs are promising, but their design is complex, and they lack integrated solutions to enable sustained autonomous operations and navigation with simple, low-infrastructure.
  We propose a compact, self-sustaining LTA drone that uses light for both energy harvesting and navigation. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a high-fidelity simulation framework to analyze LTA aerodynamics and select a stable, efficient configuration; (ii) a framework to integrate solar cells on the envelope to provide net-positive energy; and (iii) a point-and-go navigation system with three light-seeking algorithms operating on a single light beacon.
  Our LTA-analysis, together with the integrated solar panels, not only saves energy while flying, but also enables sustainable operation: providing 1 minute of flying time for every 4 minutes of energy harvesting, under illuminations of 80klux. We also demonstrate robust single-beacon navigation towards a light source that can be up to 7m away, in indoor and outdoor environments, even with moderate winds. The resulting system indicates a plausible path toward persistent, autonomous operation for indoor and outdoor monitoring. More broadly, this work provides a practical pathway for translating the promise of LTA drones into a persistent, self-sustaining aerial system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13088v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Patient-Conditioned Adaptive Offsets for Reliable Diagnosis across Subgroups</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13094</link><description>arXiv:2601.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models for medical diagnosis often exhibit uneven performance across patient populations due to heterogeneity in disease prevalence, imaging appearance, and clinical risk profiles. Existing algorithmic fairness approaches typically seek to reduce such disparities by suppressing sensitive attributes. However, in medical settings these attributes often carry essential diagnostic information, and removing them can degrade accuracy and reliability, particularly in high-stakes applications. In contrast, clinical decision making explicitly incorporates patient context when interpreting diagnostic evidence, suggesting a different design direction for subgroup-aware models. In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a patient-conditioned adaptation framework that improves subgroup reliability while maintaining a shared diagnostic model. Clinically relevant attributes such as age and sex are encoded into a compact embedding and used to condition a hypernetwork-style module, which generates small residual modulation parameters for selected layers of a shared backbone. This design preserves the general medical knowledge learned by the backbone while enabling targeted adjustments that reflect patient-specific variability. To ensure efficiency and robustness, adaptations are constrained through low-rank and bottlenecked parameterizations, limiting both model complexity and computational overhead. Experiments across multiple public medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves subgroup-level performance without sacrificing overall accuracy. On the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, our method outperforms the strongest competing baseline by 4.1% in recall and 4.4% in F1 score, with larger gains observed for underrepresented patient populations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13094v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-VLM Fusion Framework for Autonomous Maritime Port Inspection using a Heterogeneous UAV-USV System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13096</link><description>arXiv:2601.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maritime port inspection plays a critical role in ensuring safety, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency in complex maritime environments. However, existing inspection methods often rely on manual operations and conventional computer vision techniques that lack scalability and contextual understanding. This study introduces a novel integrated engineering framework that utilizes the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enable autonomous maritime port inspection using cooperative aerial and surface robotic platforms. The proposed framework replaces traditional state-machine mission planners with LLM-driven symbolic planning and improved perception pipelines through VLM-based semantic inspection, enabling context-aware and adaptive monitoring. The LLM module translates natural language mission instructions into executable symbolic plans with dependency graphs that encode operational constraints and ensure safe UAV-USV coordination. Meanwhile, the VLM module performs real-time semantic inspection and compliance assessment, generating structured reports with contextual reasoning. The framework was validated using the extended MBZIRC Maritime Simulator with realistic port infrastructure and further assessed through real-world robotic inspection trials. The lightweight on-board design ensures suitability for resource-constrained maritime platforms, advancing the development of intelligent, autonomous inspection systems.

Abstract: We present RM-RF, a lightweight reward model for run-free evaluation of automatically generated unit tests. Instead of repeatedly compiling and executing candidate tests, RM-RF predicts - from source and test code alone - three execution-derived signals: (1) whether the augmented test suite compiles and runs successfully, (2) whether the generated test cases increase code coverage, and (3) whether the generated test cases improve the mutation kill rate. To train and evaluate RM-RF we assemble a multilingual dataset (Java, Python, Go) of focal files, test files, and candidate test additions labeled by an execution-based pipeline, and we release an associated dataset and methodology for comparative evaluation. We tested multiple model families and tuning regimes (zero-shot, full fine-tuning, and PEFT via LoRA), achieving an average F1 of 0.69 across the three targets. Compared to conventional compile-and-run instruments, RM-RF provides substantially lower latency and infrastructure cost while delivering competitive predictive fidelity, enabling fast, scalable feedback for large-scale test generation and RL-based code optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Alexandria: A Multi-Domain Dialectal Arabic Machine Translation Dataset for Culturally Inclusive and Linguistically Diverse LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13099</link><description>arXiv:2601.13099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabic is a highly diglossic language where most daily communication occurs in regional dialects rather than Modern Standard Arabic. Despite this, machine translation (MT) systems often generalize poorly to dialectal input, limiting their utility for millions of speakers. We introduce \textbf{Alexandria}, a large-scale, community-driven, human-translated dataset designed to bridge this gap. Alexandria covers 13 Arab countries and 11 high-impact domains, including health, education, and agriculture. Unlike previous resources, Alexandria provides unprecedented granularity by associating contributions with city-of-origin metadata, capturing authentic local varieties beyond coarse regional labels. The dataset consists of multi-turn conversational scenarios annotated with speaker-addressee gender configurations, enabling the study of gender-conditioned variation in dialectal use. Comprising 107K total samples, Alexandria serves as both a training resource and a rigorous benchmark for evaluating MT and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our automatic and human evaluation of Arabic-aware LLMs benchmarks current capabilities in translating across diverse Arabic dialects and sub-dialects, while exposing significant persistent challenges.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13099v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recursive Meta-Distillation: An Axiomatic Framework for Iterative Knowledge Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13100</link><description>arXiv:2601.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in probability-domain knowledge distillation has established axiomatic frameworks for temperature scaling, multi-teacher aggregation, and bias-variance trade-offs in single-stage settings. However, the mathematical behavior of recursive or multi-generation distillation remains poorly understood, with prior approaches relying primarily on empirical heuristics. In this work, we introduce an axiomatic and operator-theoretic framework for recursive meta-distillation, formalizing iterative knowledge distillation as a sequence of probability-distribution operators with explicit anchoring to base teachers.
  We define structural axioms for valid meta-teacher construction and prove the existence of non-trivial operator families satisfying these axioms without specifying particular algorithms or loss functions. Under mild realizability and convexity assumptions, we show that anchored recursive distillation induces contraction in KL divergence, yielding geometric convergence to base teacher distributions and a unique, globally attractive fixed point.
  The contribution is foundational rather than algorithmic: the framework characterizes when recursive distillation is mathematically well-posed and convergent rather than error-accumulating, independent of model architecture, optimization details, or specific operator instantiations. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding stability, bias-variance behavior, and failure modes in iterative and multi-teacher distillation under capacity constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13100v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Lora Fine-Tuning and Knowledge Bases for Construction Identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13105</link><description>arXiv:2601.13105v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants are widely used and highly effective optimization methods in machine learning, especially for neural network training. By using a single datum or a small subset of the data, selected randomly at each iteration, SGD scales well to problem size and has been shown to be effective for solving large-scale inverse problems. In this work, we investigate SGD for solving nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces through the lens of iterative regularization. Under general assumptions, we prove almost sure convergence of the iterates to the minimum distance solution and show the regularizing property in expectation under an a priori stopping rule. Further, we establish convergence rates under the conditional stability assumptions for both exact and noisy data. Numerical experiments on Schlieren tomography and electrical impedance tomography are presented to show distinct features of the method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13110v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CORE-T: COherent REtrieval of Tables for Text-to-SQL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13111</link><description>arXiv:2601.13111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic text-to-SQL workflows often require joining multiple tables. As a result, accurately retrieving the relevant set of tables becomes a key bottleneck for end-to-end performance. We study an open-book setting where queries must be answered over large, heterogeneous table collections pooled from many sources, without clean scoping signals such as database identifiers. Here, dense retrieval (DR) achieves high recall but returns many distractors, while join-aware alternatives often rely on extra assumptions and/or incur high inference overhead. We propose CORE-T, a scalable, training-free framework that enriches tables with LLM-generated purpose metadata and pre-computes a lightweight table-compatibility cache. At inference time, DR returns top-K candidates; a single LLM call selects a coherent, joinable subset, and a simple additive adjustment step restores strongly compatible tables. Across Bird, Spider, and MMQA, CORE-T improves table-selection F1 by up to 22.7 points while retrieving up to 42% fewer tables, improving multi-table execution accuracy by up to 5.0 points on Bird and 6.9 points on MMQA, and using 4-5x fewer tokens than LLM-intensive baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13111v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CODE: A Contradiction-Based Deliberation Extension Framework for Overthinking Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13112</link><description>arXiv:2601.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing reasoning models into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhances task performance through step-by-step reasoning, logical consistency, and multi-step self-verification. However, recent studies have shown that reasoning models suffer from overthinking attacks, where models are tricked to generate unnecessarily high number of reasoning tokens. In this paper, we reveal that such overthinking risk can be inherited by RAG systems equipped with reasoning models, by proposing an end-to-end attack framework named Contradiction-Based Deliberation Extension (CODE). Specifically, CODE develops a multi-agent architecture to construct poisoning samples that are injected into the knowledge base. These samples 1) are highly correlated with the use query, such that can be retrieved as inputs to the reasoning model; and 2) contain contradiction between the logical and evidence layers that cause models to overthink, and are optimized to exhibit highly diverse styles. Moreover, the inference overhead of CODE is extremely difficult to detect, as no modification is needed on the user query, and the task accuracy remain unaffected. Extensive experiments on two datasets across five commercial reasoning models demonstrate that the proposed attack causes a 5.32x-24.72x increase in reasoning token consumption, without degrading task performance. Finally, we also discuss and evaluate potential countermeasures to mitigate overthinking risks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IntAgent: NWDAF-Based Intent LLM Agent Towards Advanced Next Generation Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13114</link><description>arXiv:2601.13114v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a popular interface for human-AI interaction, supporting information seeking and task assistance through natural, multi-turn dialogue. To respond to users within multi-turn dialogues, the context-dependent user intent evolves across interactions, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation, and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Existing studies usually follow static rewrite, retrieve, and generate pipelines, which optimize different procedures separately and overlook the mixed-initiative action optimization simultaneously. Although the recent developments in deep search agents demonstrate the effectiveness in jointly optimizing retrieval and generation via reasoning, these approaches focus on single-turn scenarios, which might lack the ability to handle multi-turn interactions. We introduce a conversational agent that interleaves search and reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned through reinforcement learning (RL) training with tailored rewards towards evolving user goals. The experimental results across four widely used conversational benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by surpassing several existing strong baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13115v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] xBound: Join Size Lower Bounds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13117</link><description>arXiv:2601.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud database vendors invest substantial resources into their query optimizers, and for good reason. Cardinality estimation, a cornerstone of the optimizer, is critical for the selection of efficient query plans, as well as downstream tasks such as resource allocation and query scheduling. Yet, as many practitioners and researchers have noted, it is also the optimizer's Achilles heel. Prior studies on a number of industrial-strength databases show substantial cardinality estimation errors on all tested systems, with a far greater tendency to underestimate than to overestimate. Unfortunately, cardinality underestimation is more problematic than overestimation, as it misleads the optimizer to choose plans designed for small data, leading to underprovisioned CPU and memory.
  While previous work on pessimistic cardinality estimation has proposed provable join size upper bounds, such methods can only correct overestimation, leaving the more harmful problem of underestimation unaddressed. To fill this critical gap, we introduce xBound, the very first framework for deriving provable join size lower bounds. xBound successfully reduces underestimation in real systems: On the JOBlight benchmark, it corrects 17.5% of subexpression underestimates in DuckDB and 8.7% in PostgreSQL, while on a Microsoft enterprise workload, it fixes 36.1% of Fabric Data Warehouse's underestimates, demonstrating a significant step towards solving this long-standing problem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13117v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Guidelines to Prompt Large Language Models for Code Generation: An Empirical Characterization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13118</link><description>arXiv:2601.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are nowadays extensively used for various types of software engineering tasks, primarily code generation. Previous research has shown how suitable prompt engineering could help developers in improving their code generation prompts. However, so far, there do not exist specific guidelines driving developers towards writing suitable prompts for code generation. In this work, we derive and evaluate development-specific prompt optimization guidelines. First, we use an iterative, test-driven approach to automatically refine code generation prompts, and we analyze the outcome of this process to identify prompt improvement items that lead to test passes. We use such elements to elicit 10 guidelines for prompt improvement, related to better specifying I/O, pre-post conditions, providing examples, various types of details, or clarifying ambiguities. We conduct an assessment with 50 practitioners, who report their usage of the elicited prompt improvement patterns, as well as their perceived usefulness, which does not always correspond to the actual usage before knowing our guidelines. Our results lead to implications not only for practitioners and educators, but also for those aimed at creating better LLM-aided software development tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13118v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Responsible AI for General-Purpose Systems: Overview, Challenges, and A Path Forward</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13122</link><description>arXiv:2601.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern general-purpose AI systems made using large language and vision models, are capable of performing a range of tasks like writing text articles, generating and debugging codes, querying databases, and translating from one language to another, which has made them quite popular across industries. However, there are risks like hallucinations, toxicity, and stereotypes in their output that make them untrustworthy. We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts. We argue that this is due to the non-deterministically high Degree of Freedom in output (DoFo) of general-purpose AI (unlike the deterministically constant or low DoFo of traditional task-specific AI systems), and there is a need to rethink our approach to RAI for general-purpose AI. Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13122v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Streamlined Attention-Based Network for Descriptor Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13126</link><description>arXiv:2601.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SANDesc, a Streamlined Attention-Based Network for Descriptor extraction that aims to improve on existing architectures for keypoint description.
  Our descriptor network learns to compute descriptors that improve matching without modifying the underlying keypoint detector. We employ a revised U-Net-like architecture enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and residual paths, enabling effective local representation while maintaining computational efficiency. We refer to the building blocks of our model as Residual U-Net Blocks with Attention. The model is trained using a modified triplet loss in combination with a curriculum learning-inspired hard negative mining strategy, which improves training stability.
  Extensive experiments on HPatches, MegaDepth-1500, and the Image Matching Challenge 2021 show that training SANDesc on top of existing keypoint detectors leads to improved results on multiple matching tasks compared to the original keypoint descriptors. At the same time, SANDesc has a model complexity of just 2.4 million parameters.
  As a further contribution, we introduce a new urban dataset featuring 4K images and pre-calibrated intrinsics, designed to evaluate feature extractors. On this benchmark, SANDesc achieves substantial performance gains over the existing descriptors while operating with limited computational resources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PhaseMark: A Post-hoc, Optimization-Free Watermarking of AI-generated Images in the Latent Frequency Domain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13128</link><description>arXiv:2601.13128v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We present GaussExplorer, a framework for embodied exploration and reasoning built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While prior approaches to language-embedded 3DGS have made meaningful progress in aligning simple text queries with Gaussian embeddings, they are generally optimized for relatively simple queries and struggle to interpret more complex, compositional language queries. Alternative studies based on object-centric RGB-D structured memories provide spatial grounding but are constrained by pre-fixed viewpoints. To address these issues, GaussExplorer introduces Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on top of 3DGS to enable question-driven exploration and reasoning within 3D scenes. We first identify pre-captured images that are most correlated with the query question, and subsequently adjust them into novel viewpoints to more accurately capture visual information for better reasoning by VLMs. Experiments show that ours outperforms existing methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-based reasoning with 3DGS for embodied tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CLIP-Guided Adaptable Self-Supervised Learning for Human-Centric Visual Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13133</link><description>arXiv:2601.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-centric visual analysis plays a pivotal role in diverse applications, including surveillance, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. With the emergence of large-scale unlabeled human image datasets, there is an increasing need for a general unsupervised pre-training model capable of supporting diverse human-centric downstream tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose CLASP (CLIP-guided Adaptable Self-suPervised learning), a novel framework designed for unsupervised pre-training in human-centric visual tasks. CLASP leverages the powerful vision-language model CLIP to generate both low-level (e.g., body parts) and high-level (e.g., attributes) semantic pseudo-labels. These multi-level semantic cues are then integrated into the learned visual representations, enriching their expressiveness and generalizability. Recognizing that different downstream tasks demand varying levels of semantic granularity, CLASP incorporates a Prompt-Controlled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module. MoE dynamically adapts feature extraction based on task-specific prompts, mitigating potential feature conflicts and enhancing transferability. Furthermore, CLASP employs a multi-task pre-training strategy, where part- and attribute-level pseudo-labels derived from CLIP guide the representation learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CLASP consistently outperforms existing unsupervised pre-training methods, advancing the field of human-centric visual analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Earth Embeddings as Products: Taxonomy, Ecosystem, and Standardized Access</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13134</link><description>arXiv:2601.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) provide powerful representations, but high compute costs hinder their widespread use. Pre-computed embedding data products offer a practical "frozen" alternative, yet they currently exist in a fragmented ecosystem of incompatible formats and resolutions. This lack of standardization creates an engineering bottleneck that prevents meaningful model comparison and reproducibility. We formalize this landscape through a three-layer taxonomy: Data, Tools, and Value. We survey existing products to identify interoperability barriers. To bridge this gap, we extend TorchGeo with a unified API that standardizes the loading and querying of diverse embedding products. By treating embeddings as first-class geospatial datasets, we decouple downstream analysis from model-specific engineering, providing a roadmap for more transparent and accessible Earth observation workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Alignment: Ensuring Value Consistency in Large Language Models for Sensitive Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13137</link><description>arXiv:2601.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the wide application of large language models (LLMs), the problems of bias and value inconsistency in sensitive domains have gradually emerged, especially in terms of race, society and politics. In this paper, we propose an adversarial alignment framework, which enhances the value consistency of the model in sensitive domains through continued pre-training, instruction fine-tuning and adversarial training. In adversarial training, we use the Attacker to generate controversial queries, the Actor to generate responses with value consistency, and the Critic to filter and ensure response quality. Furthermore, we train a Value-Consistent Large Language Model, VC-LLM, for sensitive domains, and construct a bilingual evaluation dataset in Chinese and English. The experimental results show that VC-LLM performs better than the existing mainstream models in both Chinese and English tests, verifying the effectiveness of the method. Warning: This paper contains examples of LLMs that are offensive or harmful in nature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13137v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Human to Machine Refactoring: Assessing GPT-4's Impact on Python Class Quality and Readability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13139</link><description>arXiv:2601.13139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refactoring is a software engineering practice that aims to improve code quality without altering program behavior. Although automated refactoring tools have been extensively studied, their practical applicability remains limited. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for automated code refactoring. The evaluation of such an LLM-driven approach, however, leaves unanswered questions about its effects on code quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on LLM-driven refactoring using GPT-4o, applied to 100 Python classes from the ClassEval benchmark. Unlike prior work, our study explores a wide range of class-level refactorings inspired by Fowler's catalog and evaluates their effects from three complementary perspectives: (i) behavioral correctness, verified through unit tests; (ii) code quality, assessed via Pylint, Flake8, and SonarCloud; and (iii) readability, measured using a state-of-the-art readability tool. Our findings show that GPT-4o generally produces behavior-preserving refactorings that reduce code smells and improve quality metrics, albeit at the cost of decreased readability. Our results provide new evidence on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in automated software refactoring, highlighting directions for integrating LLMs into practical refactoring workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13139v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TVWorld: Foundations for Remote-Control TV Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13142</link><description>arXiv:2601.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for device control. However, existing research has primarily focused on point-and-click (PnC) interaction, while remote-control (RC) interaction commonly encountered in everyday TV usage remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{TVWorld}, an offline graph-based abstraction of real-world TV navigation that enables reproducible and deployment-free evaluation. On this basis, we derive two complementary benchmarks that comprehensively assess TV-use capabilities: \textbf{TVWorld-N} for topology-aware navigation and \textbf{TVWorld-G} for focus-aware grounding. These benchmarks expose a key limitation of existing agents: insufficient topology awareness for focus-based, long-horizon TV navigation. Motivated by this finding, we propose a \emph{Topology-Aware Training} framework that injects topology awareness into LVLMs. Using this framework, we develop \textbf{TVTheseus}, a foundation model specialized for TV navigation. TVTheseus achieves a success rate of $68.3\%$ on TVWorld-N, surpassing strong closed-source baselines such as Gemini 3 Flash and establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additional analyses further provide valuable insights into the development of effective TV-use agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FastAV: Efficient Token Pruning for Audio-Visual Large Language Model Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13143</link><description>arXiv:2601.13143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present FastAV, the first token pruning framework tailored for audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs). While token pruning has been actively explored in standard large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs), its application to AV-LLMs has received little attention, even though multimodal integration substantially increases their token demands. To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastAV reduces FLOPs by more than 40% on two representative AV-LLMs, while preserving or even improving model performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13143v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OPTIMUM-DERAM: Highly Consistent, Scalable, and Secure Multi-Object Memory using RLNC</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13146</link><description>arXiv:2601.13146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces OPTIMUM-DERAM, a highly consistent, scalable, secure, and decentralized shared memory solution. Traditional distributed shared memory implementations offer multi-object support by multi-threading a single object memory instance over the same set of data hosts. While theoretically sound, the amount of resources required made such solutions prohibitively expensive in practical systems. OPTIMUM-DERAM proposes a decentralized, reconfigurable, atomic read/write shared memory (DeRAM) that: (i) achieves improved performance and storage scalability by leveraging Random Linear Network Codes (RLNC); (ii) scales in the number of supported atomic objects by introducing a new object placement and discovery approach based on a consistent hashing ring; (iii) scales in the number of participants by allowing dynamic joins and departures leveraging a blockchain oracle to serve as a registry service; and (iv) is secure against malicious behavior by tolerating Byzantine failures.
  Experimental results over a globally distributed set of nodes, help us realize the performance and scalability gains of OPTIMUM-DERAM over previous distributed shared memory solutions (i.e., the ABD algorithm [3])</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ICo3D: An Interactive Conversational 3D Virtual Human</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13148</link><description>arXiv:2601.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents Interactive Conversational 3D Virtual Human (ICo3D), a method for generating an interactive, conversational, and photorealistic 3D human avatar. Based on multi-view captures of a subject, we create an animatable 3D face model and a dynamic 3D body model, both rendered by splatting Gaussian primitives. Once merged together, they represent a lifelike virtual human avatar suitable for real-time user interactions. We equip our avatar with an LLM for conversational ability. During conversation, the audio speech of the avatar is used as a driving signal to animate the face model, enabling precise synchronization. We describe improvements to our dynamic Gaussian models that enhance photorealism: SWinGS++ for body reconstruction and HeadGaS++ for face reconstruction, and provide as well a solution to merge the separate face and body models without artifacts. We also present a demo of the complete system, showcasing several use cases of real-time conversation with the 3D avatar. Our approach offers a fully integrated virtual avatar experience, supporting both oral and written form interactions in immersive environments. ICo3D is applicable to a wide range of fields, including gaming, virtual assistance, and personalized education, among others.

Abstract: Long-context inference enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) while incurring significant computational overhead. Token-oriented methods, such as pruning and skipping, have shown promise in reducing inference latency, but still suffer from inherently limited acceleration potential, outdated proxy signals, and redundancy interference, thus yielding suboptimal speed-accuracy trade-offs. To address these challenges, we propose SPTS (Self-Predictive Token Skipping), a training-free framework for efficient long-context LLM inference. Specifically, motivated by the thought of probing the influence of targeted skipping layers, we design two component-specific strategies for selective token skipping: Partial Attention Probing (PAP) for multi-head attention, which selects informative tokens by performing partial forward attention computation, and Low-rank Transformation Probing (LTP) for feed forward network, which constructs a low-rank proxy network to predict token transformations. Furthermore, a Multi-Stage Delayed Pruning (MSDP) strategy reallocates the skipping budget and progressively prunes redundant tokens across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 2.46$\times$ and 2.29$\times$ speedups for prefilling and end-to-end generation, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art model performance. The source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13155v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training instability in deep learning follows low-dimensional dynamical principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13160</link><description>arXiv:2601.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning systems achieve remarkable empirical performance, yet the stability of the training process itself remains poorly understood. Training unfolds as a high-dimensional dynamical system in which small perturbations to optimization, data, parameters, or learning signals can induce abrupt and irreversible collapse, undermining reproducibility and scalability.
  We propose a unified dynamical perspective that characterizes training stability as an intrinsic property of learning systems, organized along four interacting dimensions: optimization, environmental/data, parametric, and learning-signal stability. We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.
  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13160v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeuroShield: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Adversarial Robustness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13162</link><description>arXiv:2601.13162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial vulnerability and lack of interpretability are critical limitations of deep neural networks, especially in safety-sensitive settings such as autonomous driving. We introduce \DesignII, a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates symbolic rule supervision into neural networks to enhance both adversarial robustness and explainability. Domain knowledge is encoded as logical constraints over appearance attributes such as shape and color, and enforced through semantic and symbolic logic losses applied during training. Using the GTSRB dataset, we evaluate robustness against FGSM and PGD attacks at a standard $\ell_\infty$ perturbation budget of $\varepsilon = 8/255$. Relative to clean training, standard adversarial training provides modest improvements in robustness ($\sim$10 percentage points). Conversely, our FGSM-Neuro-Symbolic and PGD-Neuro-Symbolic models achieve substantially larger gains, improving adversarial accuracy by 18.1\% and 17.35\% over their corresponding adversarial-training baselines, representing roughly a three-fold larger robustness gain than standard adversarial training provides when both are measured relative to the same clean-training baseline, without reducing clean-sample accuracy. Compared to transformer-based defenses such as LNL-MoEx, which require heavy architectures and extensive data augmentation, our PGD-Neuro-Symbolic variant attains comparable or superior robustness using a ResNet18 backbone trained for 10 epochs. These results show that symbolic reasoning offers an effective path to robust and interpretable AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13162v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From 100,000+ images to winning the first brain MRI foundation model challenges: Sharing lessons and models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13166</link><description>arXiv:2601.13166v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The growing demand for mobile data services in dense urban areas has intensified the need for energy-efficient radio access networks (RANs) in future 6G systems. In this context, one promising strategy is cell switching (CS), which dynamically deactivates underutilized small base stations (SBSs) to reduce power consumption. However, while previous research explored CS primarily based on traffic load, ensuring user quality of service (QoS) under realistic channel conditions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-driven CS framework that jointly minimizes network power consumption and guarantees user QoS by enforcing a minimum received power threshold as part of offloading decisions. In contrast to prior load-based or learning-based approaches, our method explicitly integrates channel-aware information into the CS process, thus ensuring reliable service quality for offloaded users. Furthermore, flexibility of the proposed framework enables operators to adapt system behavior between energy-saving and QoS-preserving modes by tuning a single design parameter. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 30% power savings as compared to baseline methods while fully maintaining QoS under diverse network conditions. Scalability and robustness of the proposed method in realistic heterogeneous networks (HetNets) further highlight its potential as a practical solution for sustainable 6G deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13174v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Helical Tendon-Driven Continuum Robot with Programmable Follow-the-Leader Operation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13177</link><description>arXiv:2601.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is primarily utilized for pain management and has recently demonstrated efficacy in promoting functional recovery in patients with spinal cord injury. Effective stimulation of motor neurons ideally requires the placement of SCS leads in the ventral or lateral epidural space where the corticospinal and rubrospinal motor fibers are located. This poses significant challenges with the current standard of manual steering. In this study, we present a static modeling approach for the ExoNav, a steerable robotic tool designed to facilitate precise navigation to the ventral and lateral epidural space. Cosserat rod framework is employed to establish the relationship between tendon actuation forces and the robot's overall shape. The effects of gravity, as an example of an external load, are investigated and implemented in the model and simulation. The experimental results indicate RMSE values of 1.76mm, 2.33mm, 2.18mm, and 1.33mm across four tested prototypes. Based on the helical shape of the ExoNav upon actuation, it is capable of performing follow-the-leader (FTL) motion by adding insertion and rotation DoFs to this robotic system, which is shown in simulation and experimentally. The proposed simulation has the capability to calculate optimum tendon tensions to follow the desired FTL paths while gravity-induced robot deformations are present. Three FTL experimental trials are conducted and the end-effector position showed repeatable alignments with the desired path with maximum RMSE value of 3.75mm. Ultimately, a phantom model demonstration is conducted where the teleoperated robot successfully navigated to the lateral and ventral spinal cord targets. Additionally, the user was able to navigate to the dorsal root ganglia, illustrating ExoNav's potential in both motor function recovery and pain management.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13177v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Medical Triage as Pairwise Ranking: A Benchmark for Urgency in Patient Portal Messages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13178</link><description>arXiv:2601.13178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical triage is the task of allocating medical resources and prioritizing patients based on medical need. This paper introduces the first large-scale public dataset for studying medical triage in the context of asynchronous outpatient portal messages. Our novel task formulation views patient message triage as a pairwise inference problem, where we train LLMs to choose `"which message is more medically urgent" in a head-to-head tournament-style re-sort of a physician's inbox. Our novel benchmark PMR-Bench contains 1569 unique messages and 2,000+ high-quality test pairs for pairwise medical urgency assessment alongside a scalable training data generation pipeline. PMR-Bench includes samples that contain both unstructured patient-written messages alongside real electronic health record (EHR) data, emulating a real-world medical triage scenario.
  We develop a novel automated data annotation strategy to provide LLMs with in-domain guidance on this task. The resulting data is used to train two model classes, UrgentReward and UrgentSFT, leveraging Bradley-Terry and next token prediction objective, respectively to perform pairwise urgency classification. We find that UrgentSFT achieves top performance on PMR-Bench, with UrgentReward showing distinct advantages in low-resource settings. For example, UrgentSFT-8B and UrgentReward-8B provide a 15- and 16-point boost, respectively, on inbox sorting metrics over off-the-shelf 8B models.

Abstract: Reasoning benchmarks have played a crucial role in the progress of language models. Yet rigorous evaluation remains a significant challenge as static question-answer pairs provide only a snapshot of performance, compressing complex behavior into a single accuracy metric. This limitation is especially true in complex, rule-bound domains such as law, where existing benchmarks are costly to build and ill suited for isolating specific failure modes. To address this, we introduce OpenExempt, a framework and benchmark for diagnostic evaluation of legal reasoning. The OpenExempt Framework uses expert-crafted symbolic representations of U.S. Bankruptcy Code statutes to dynamically generate a large space of natural language reasoning tasks and their machine-computable solutions on demand. This gives users fine-grained control over task complexity and scope, allowing individual reasoning skills to be probed in isolation. Using this system, we construct the OpenExempt Benchmark, a diagnostic benchmark for legal reasoning with 9,765 samples across nine evaluation suites designed to carefully probe model capabilities. Experiments on 13 diverse language models reveal sharp performance cliffs that emerge only under longer reasoning paths and in the presence of obfuscating statements. We release the framework and benchmark publicly to support research aimed at understanding and improving the next generation of reasoning systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13183v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompt Injection Mitigation with Agentic AI, Nested Learning, and AI Sustainability via Semantic Caching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13186</link><description>arXiv:2601.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection remains a central obstacle to the safe deployment of large language models, particularly in multi-agent settings where intermediate outputs can propagate or amplify malicious instructions. Building on earlier work that introduced a four-metric Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS), this paper extends the evaluation framework with semantic similarity-based caching and a fifth metric (Observability Score Ratio) to yield TIVS-O, investigating how defence effectiveness interacts with transparency in a HOPE-inspired Nested Learning architecture. The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scientific production in the era of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13187</link><description>arXiv:2601.13187v1 Announce Type: new

We find: 1) scientists adopting LLMs to draft manuscripts demonstrate a large increase in paper production, ranging from 23.7-89.3% depending on scientific field and author background, 2) LLM use has reversed the relationship between writing complexity and paper quality, leading to an influx of manuscripts that are linguistically complex but substantively underwhelming, and 3) LLM adopters access and cite more diverse prior work, including books and younger, less-cited documents. These findings highlight a stunning shift in scientific production that will likely require a change in how journals, funding agencies, and tenure committees evaluate scientific works.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13187v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Negotiating Relationships with ChatGPT: Perceptions, External Influences, and Strategies for AI Companionship</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13188</link><description>arXiv:2601.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals are turning to increasingly anthropomorphic, general-purpose chatbots for AI companionship, rather than roleplay-specific platforms. However, not much is known about how individuals perceive and conduct their relationships with general-purpose chatbots. We analyzed semi-structured interviews (n=13), survey responses (n=43), and community discussions on Reddit (41k+ posts and comments) to triangulate the internal dynamics, external influences, and steering strategies that shape AI companion relationships. We learned that individuals conceptualize their companions based on an interplay of their beliefs about the companion's own agency and the autonomy permitted by the platform, how they pursue interactions with the companion, and the perceived initiatives that the companion takes. In combination with the external entities that affect relationship dynamics, particularly model updates that can derail companion behaviour and stability, individuals make use of different types of steering strategies to preserve their relationship, for example, by setting behavioural instructions or porting to other AI platforms. We discuss implications for accountability and transparency in AI systems, where emotional connection competes with broader product objectives and safety constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13188v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LAViG-FLOW: Latent Autoregressive Video Generation for Fluid Flow Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13190</link><description>arXiv:2601.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and forecasting subsurface multiphase fluid flow fields underpin applications ranging from geological CO2 sequestration (GCS) operations to geothermal production. This is essential for ensuring both operational performance and long-term safety. While high fidelity multiphase simulators are widely used for this purpose, they become prohibitively expensive once many forward runs are required for inversion purposes and quantify uncertainty. To tackle this challenge we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time. We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window. Evaluated on an open-source CO2 sequestration dataset, LAViG-FLOW generates saturation and pressure fields that stay consistent across time while running orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical solvers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13190v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active Informative Planning for UAV-based Weed Mapping using Discrete Gaussian Process Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13196</link><description>arXiv:2601.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate agricultural weed mapping using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for precision farming. While traditional methods rely on rigid, pre-defined flight paths and intensive offline processing, informative path planning (IPP) offers a way to collect data adaptively where it is most needed. Gaussian process (GP) mapping provides a continuous model of weed distribution with built-in uncertainty. However, GPs must be discretised for practical use in autonomous planning. Many discretisation techniques exist, but the impact of discrete representation choice remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how different discrete GP representations influence both mapping quality and mission-level performance in UAV-based weed mapping. Considering a UAV equipped with a downward-facing camera, we implement a receding-horizon IPP strategy that selects sampling locations based on the map uncertainty, travel cost, and coverage penalties. We investigate multiple discretisation strategies for representing the GP posterior and use their induced map partitions to generate candidate viewpoints for planning. Experiments on real-world weed distributions show that representation choice significantly affects exploration behaviour and efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that discretisation is not only a representational detail but a key design choice that shapes planning dynamics, coverage efficiency, and computational load in online UAV weed mapping.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion-Driven Synthetic Tabular Data Generation for Enhanced DoS/DDoS Attack Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13197</link><description>arXiv:2601.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class imbalance refers to a situation where certain classes in a dataset have significantly fewer samples than oth- ers, leading to biased model performance. Class imbalance in network intrusion detection using Tabular Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (TabDDPM) for data augmentation is ad- dressed in this paper. Our approach synthesizes high-fidelity minority-class samples from the CIC-IDS2017 dataset through iterative denoising processes. For the minority classes that have smaller samples, synthetic samples were generated and merged with the original dataset. The augmented training data enables an ANN classifier to achieve near-perfect recall on previously underrepresented attack classes. These results establish diffusion models as an effective solution for tabular data imbalance in security domains, with potential applications in fraud detection and medical diagnostics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13197v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Achilles' Heel of Angular Margins: A Chebyshev Polynomial Fix for Speaker Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13198</link><description>arXiv:2601.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular margin losses, such as AAM-Softmax, have become the de facto in speaker and face verification. Their success hinges on directly manipulating the angle between features and class prototypes. However, this manipulation relies on the arccos function to recover the angle, introducing a significant yet overlooked source of training instability. The derivative of arccos explodes at its boundaries, causing gradient peaks during optimisation. Furthermore, the formulation fails to generate a sufficiently sharp gradient for hard-to-classify examples. We address these issues by proposing ChebyAAM, a loss that replaces the arccos operation with its Chebyshev polynomial approximation. This substitution eliminates gradient explosion and applies a stronger corrective signal to hard examples, leading to more effective optimisation. Experiments on three benchmarks (VoxCeleb, SITW, and CN-Celeb) demonstrate that our method resolves the instability and consistently improves performance. Our work suggests that approximating angular operations, rather than calculating them explicitly, offers a more robust path for designing future metric learning losses.

Abstract: Time-matching requirements (TMRs) for clean electricity procurement are increasingly adopted in voluntary corporate sustainability initiatives and regulatory frameworks. While prior research has evaluated cost and emissions impacts of hourly vs. annual TMR, these studies typically rely on single-year weather scenarios that do not capture inter-annual variability in variable renewable energy (VRE) generation. We use a capacity expansion model to assess how inter-annual weather variability affects procurement-driven infrastructure investments, costs, and emissions for a grid-connected hydrogen producer under both annual and hourly time-matching strategies. Using a Texas case study, we compare deterministic (single weather scenario) and stochastic (nine weather scenarios) modeling approaches. Both procurement investments and cost and emissions outcomes are sensitive to weather scenario, with annual matching exhibiting greater sensitivity than hourly matching. Stochastic modeling finds higher cost premiums for hourly versus annual matching compared to deterministic modeling, though emissions trends remain directionally consistent. Demand flexibility through H2 storage is critical for lowering hourly matching cost premiums under weather-driven VRE variability. Partial hourly matching (e.g., 80-90% compliance) can modestly reduce costs while maintaining minimal emissions impacts. Finally, we examine how grid-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS) affect additionality and emissions. When stringent additionality is achieved via binding RPS constraints on non-H2 electricity demand, annual matching can produce emissions reductions comparable to hourly matching at lower cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Deadlines Reveal Temporal Awareness Failures in LLM Strategic Dialogues</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13206</link><description>arXiv:2601.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text token-by-token in discrete time, yet real-world communication, from therapy sessions to business negotiations, critically depends on continuous time constraints. Current LLM architectures and evaluation protocols rarely test for temporal awareness under real-time deadlines. We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\% vs. 4\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\geq$95\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning. These effects replicate across negotiation scenarios and models, illustrating a systematic lack of LLM time awareness that will constrain LLM deployment in many time-sensitive applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13206v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GTPred: Benchmarking MLLMs for Interpretable Geo-localization and Time-of-capture Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13207</link><description>arXiv:2601.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geo-localization aims to infer the geographic location where an image was captured using observable visual evidence. Traditional methods achieve impressive results through large-scale training on massive image corpora. With the emergence of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), recent studies have explored their applications in geo-localization, benefiting from improved accuracy and interpretability. However, existing benchmarks largely ignore the temporal information inherent in images, which can further constrain the location. To bridge this gap, we introduce GTPred, a novel benchmark for geo-temporal prediction. GTPred comprises 370 globally distributed images spanning over 120 years. We evaluate MLLM predictions by jointly considering year and hierarchical location sequence matching, and further assess intermediate reasoning chains using meticulously annotated ground-truth reasoning processes. Experiments on 8 proprietary and 7 open-source MLLMs show that, despite strong visual perception, current models remain limited in world knowledge and geo-temporal reasoning. Results also demonstrate that incorporating temporal information significantly enhances location inference performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Skip Connections: Additive U-Net for Robust and Interpretable Denoising</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13208</link><description>arXiv:2601.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skip connections are central to U-Net architectures for image denoising, but standard concatenation doubles channel dimensionality and obscures information flow, allowing uncontrolled noise transfer. We propose the Additive U-Net, which replaces concatenative skips with gated additive connections. Each skip pathway is scaled by a learnable non-negative scalar, offering explicit and interpretable control over encoder contributions while avoiding channel inflation. Evaluations on the Kodak-17 denoising benchmark show that Additive U-Net achieves competitive PSNR/SSIM at noise levels {\sigma} = 15, 25, 50, with robustness across kernel schedules and depths. Notably, effective denoising is achieved even without explicit down/up-sampling or forced hierarchies, as the model naturally learns a progression from high-frequency to band-pass to low-frequency features. These results position additive skips as a lightweight and interpretable alternative to concatenation, enabling both efficient design and a clearer understanding of multi-scale information transfer in reconstruction networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conflict Detection in AI-RAN: Efficient Interaction Learning and Autonomous Graph Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13213</link><description>arXiv:2601.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native mobile networks represent a fundamental step toward 6G, where learning, inference, and decision making are embedded into the Radio Access Network (RAN) itself. In such networks, multiple AI agents optimize the network to achieve distinct and often competing objectives. As such, conflicts become inevitable and have the potential to degrade performance, cause instability, and disrupt service. Current approaches for conflict detection rely on conflict graphs created based on relationships between AI agents, parameters, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Existing works often rely on complex and computationally expensive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and depend on manually chosen thresholds to create conflict graphs. In this work, we present the first systematic framework for conflict detection in AI-native mobile networks, propose a two-tower encoder architecture for learning interactions based on data from the RAN, and introduce a data-driven sparsity-based mechanism for autonomously reconstructing conflict graphs without manual fine-tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13213v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An AMP-Based Asymptotic Analysis For Nonlinear One-Bit Precoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13214</link><description>arXiv:2601.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the asymptotic analysis of a class of nonlinear one-bit precoding schemes under Rayleigh fading channels. The considered scheme employs a convex-relaxation-then-quantization (CRQ) approach to the well-known minimum mean square error (MMSE) model, which includes the classical one-bit precoder SQUID as a special case. To analyze its asymptotic behavior, we develop a novel analytical framework based on approximate message passing (AMP). We show that, the statistical properties of the considered scheme can be asymptotically characterized by a scalar ``signal plus Gaussian noise'' model. Based on this, we further derive a closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) in the large-system limit, which quantitatively characterizes the impact of both system and model parameters on SEP performance. Simulation results validate our analysis and also demonstrate that performance gains over SQUID can be achieved by appropriately tuning the parameters involved in the considered model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13214v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Single-shot Writing: Deep Research Agents are Unreliable at Multi-turn Report Revision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13217</link><description>arXiv:2601.13217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Deep Research Agents (DRAs) treat report generation as a single-shot writing task, which fundamentally diverges from how human researchers iteratively draft and revise reports via self-reflection or peer feedback. Whether DRAs can reliably revise reports with user feedback remains unexplored. We introduce Mr Dre, an evaluation suite that establishes multi-turn report revision as a new evaluation axis for DRAs. Mr Dre consists of (1) a unified long-form report evaluation protocol spanning comprehensiveness, factuality, and presentation, and (2) a human-verified feedback simulation pipeline for multi-turn revision. Our analysis of five diverse DRAs reveals a critical limitation: while agents can address most user feedback, they also regress on 16-27% of previously covered content and citation quality. Over multiple revision turns, even the best-performing agents leave significant headroom, as they continue to disrupt content outside the feedback's scope and fail to preserve earlier edits. We further show that these issues are not easily resolvable through inference-time fixes such as prompt engineering and a dedicated sub-agent for report revision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13217v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Energy-Throughput Trade-off in Lossless-Compressed Source Code Storage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13220</link><description>arXiv:2601.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving data from large-scale source code archives is vital for AI training, neural-based software analysis, and information retrieval, to cite a few. This paper studies and experiments with the design of a compressed key-value store for the indexing of large-scale source code datasets, evaluating its trade-off among three primary computational resources: (compressed) space occupancy, time, and energy efficiency. Extensive experiments on a national high-performance computing infrastructure demonstrate that different compression configurations yield distinct trade-offs, with high compression ratios and order-of-magnitude gains in retrieval throughput and energy efficiency. We also study data parallelism and show that, while it significantly improves speed, scaling energy efficiency is more difficult, reflecting the known non-energy-proportionality of modern hardware and challenging the assumption of a direct time-energy correlation. This work streamlines automation in energy-aware configuration tuning and standardized green benchmarking deployable in CI/CD pipelines, thus empowering system architects with a spectrum of Pareto-optimal energy-compression-throughput trade-offs and actionable guidelines for building sustainable, efficient storage backends for massive open-source code archival.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Incorporating Q&amp;A Nuggets into Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13222</link><description>arXiv:2601.13222v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Many tools used to process programs, like compilers, analyzers, or verifiers, perform transformations on their intermediate program representation, like abstract syntax trees. Implementing such program transformations is a non-trivial task, since it is necessary to iterate over the complete syntax tree and apply various transformations at nodes in a tree. In this paper we show how the features of functional logic programming are useful to implement program transformations in a compact and comprehensible manner. For this purpose, we propose to write program transformations as partially defined and non-deterministic operations. Since the implementation of non-determinism usually causes some overhead compared to deterministically defined operations, we compare our approach to a deterministic transformation method. We evaluate these alternatives for the functional logic language Curry and its intermediate representation FlatCurry which is used in various analysis and verification tools and compilers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Not all Blends are Equal: The BLEMORE Dataset of Blended Emotion Expressions with Relative Salience Annotations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13225</link><description>arXiv:2601.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans often experience not just a single basic emotion at a time, but rather a blend of several emotions with varying salience. Despite the importance of such blended emotions, most video-based emotion recognition approaches are designed to recognize single emotions only. The few approaches that have attempted to recognize blended emotions typically cannot assess the relative salience of the emotions within a blend. This limitation largely stems from the lack of datasets containing a substantial number of blended emotion samples annotated with relative salience. To address this shortcoming, we introduce BLEMORE, a novel dataset for multimodal (video, audio) blended emotion recognition that includes information on the relative salience of each emotion within a blend. BLEMORE comprises over 3,000 clips from 58 actors, performing 6 basic emotions and 10 distinct blends, where each blend has 3 different salience configurations (50/50, 70/30, and 30/70). Using this dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification approaches on two blended emotion prediction tasks: (1) predicting the presence of emotions in a given sample, and (2) predicting the relative salience of emotions in a blend. Our results show that unimodal classifiers achieve up to 29% presence accuracy and 13% salience accuracy on the validation set, while multimodal methods yield clear improvements, with ImageBind + WavLM reaching 35% presence accuracy and HiCMAE 18% salience accuracy. On the held-out test set, the best models achieve 33% presence accuracy (VideoMAEv2 + HuBERT) and 18% salience accuracy (HiCMAE). In sum, the BLEMORE dataset provides a valuable resource to advancing research on emotion recognition systems that account for the complexity and significance of blended emotion expressions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13225v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Insider Knowledge: How Much Can RAG Systems Gain from Evaluation Secrets?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13227</link><description>arXiv:2601.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAG systems are increasingly evaluated and optimized using LLM judges, an approach that is rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for system assessment. Nugget-based approaches in particular are now embedded not only in evaluation frameworks but also in the architectures of RAG systems themselves. While this integration can lead to genuine improvements, it also creates a risk of faulty measurements due to circularity. In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted. Our results highlight the importance of blind evaluation settings and methodological diversity to guard against mistaking metric overfitting for genuine system progress.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autoregressive Models Rival Diffusion Models at ANY-ORDER Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13228</link><description>arXiv:2601.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models enable any-order generation and bidirectional conditioning, offering appealing flexibility for tasks such as infilling, rewriting, and self-correction. However, their formulation-predicting one part of a sequence from another within a single-step dependency-limits modeling depth and often yields lower sample quality and stability than autoregressive (AR) models. To address this, we revisit autoregressive modeling as a foundation and reformulate diffusion-style training into a structured multi-group prediction process. We propose Any-order Any-subset Autoregressive modeling (A3), a generalized framework that extends the standard AR factorization to arbitrary token groups and generation orders. A3 preserves the probabilistic rigor and multi-layer dependency modeling of AR while inheriting diffusion models' flexibility for parallel and bidirectional generation. We implement A3 through a two-stream attention architecture and a progressive adaptation strategy that transitions pretrained AR models toward any-order prediction. Experiments on question answering, commonsense reasoning, and story infilling demonstrate that A3 outperforms diffusion-based models while maintaining flexible decoding. This work offers a unified approach for a flexible, efficient, and novel language modeling paradigm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Matrix-Free Patch Smoothers for the Stokes Problem: Evaluating Local p-Multigrid Solvers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13230</link><description>arXiv:2601.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertex-patch smoothers offer an effective strategy for achieving robust geometric multigrid convergence for the Stokes equations, particularly in the context of high-order finite elements. However, their practical efficiency is often limited by the computational cost of solving the local saddle-point problems, especially when explicit matrix factorizations are not feasible. We explore a fully iterative, matrix-free-compatible approach to the local patch solve using $p$-multigrid techniques. We evaluate different local solver configurations: Braess-Sarazin and block-triangular preconditioners. Our numerical experiments suggest that the Braess-Sarazin approach is particularly resilient. We find that a single iteration of the local solver yields global convergence rates comparable to those obtained with exact local solvers, even on distorted meshes and in the presence of large viscosity jumps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MATTERIX: toward a digital twin for robotics-assisted chemistry laboratory automation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13232</link><description>arXiv:2601.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated materials discovery is critical for addressing global challenges. However, developing new laboratory workflows relies heavily on real-world experimental trials, and this can hinder scalability because of the need for numerous physical make-and-test iterations. Here we present MATTERIX, a multiscale, graphics processing unit-accelerated robotic simulation framework designed to create high-fidelity digital twins of chemistry laboratories, thus accelerating workflow development. This multiscale digital twin simulates robotic physical manipulation, powder and liquid dynamics, device functionalities, heat transfer and basic chemical reaction kinetics. This is enabled by integrating realistic physics simulation and photorealistic rendering with a modular graphics processing unit-accelerated semantics engine, which models logical states and continuous behaviors to simulate chemistry workflows across different levels of abstraction. MATTERIX streamlines the creation of digital twin environments through open-source asset libraries and interfaces, while enabling flexible workflow design via hierarchical plan definition and a modular skill library that incorporates learning-based methods. Our approach demonstrates sim-to-real transfer in robotic chemistry setups, reducing reliance on costly real-world experiments and enabling the testing of hypothetical automated workflows in silico.

Abstract: Metamaterials design for advanced functionality often entails the inverse design on nonlinear and condition-dependent responses (e.g., stress-strain relation and dispersion relation), which are described by continuous functions. Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations. Our framework provides a lightweight, trustworthy pathway to inverse design involving functional responses, expensive simulations, and complex design requirements, beyond metamaterials.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13233v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ConvMambaNet: A Hybrid CNN-Mamba State Space Architecture for Accurate and Real-Time EEG Seizure Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13234</link><description>arXiv:2601.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder marked by recurrent seizures that can severely impact quality of life. Electroencephalography (EEG) remains the primary tool for monitoring neural activity and detecting seizures, yet automated analysis remains challenging due to the temporal complexity of EEG signals.

By embedding the Mamba-SSM block within a CNN framework, the model effectively captures both spatial and long-range temporal dynamics. Evaluated on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset, ConvMambaNet achieved a 99% accuracy and demonstrated robust performance under severe class imbalance. These results underscore the model's potential for precise and efficient seizure detection, offering a viable path toward real-time, automated epilepsy monitoring in clinical environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13234v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RubRIX: Rubric-Driven Risk Mitigation in Caregiver-AI Interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13235</link><description>arXiv:2601.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caregivers seeking AI-mediated support express complex needs -- information-seeking, emotional validation, and distress cues -- that warrant careful evaluation of response safety and appropriateness. Existing AI evaluation frameworks, primarily focused on general risks (toxicity, hallucinations, policy violations, etc), may not adequately capture the nuanced risks of LLM-responses in caregiving-contexts.

Grounded in the Elements of an Ethic of Care, RubRIX operationalizes five empirically-derived risk dimensions: Inattention, Bias &amp; Stigma, Information Inaccuracy, Uncritical Affirmation, and Epistemic Arrogance. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs on over 20,000 caregiver queries from Reddit and ALZConnected. Rubric-guided refinement consistently reduced risk-components by 45-98% after one iteration across models. This work contributes a methodological approach for developing domain-sensitive, user-centered evaluation frameworks for high-burden contexts. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-sensitive, interactional risk evaluation for the responsible deployment of LLMs in caregiving support contexts. We release benchmark datasets to enable future research on contextual risk evaluation in AI-mediated support.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13235v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Semantic Decoupling-Based Two-Stage Rainy-Day Attack for Revealing Weather Robustness Deficiencies in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13238</link><description>arXiv:2601.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trained on image-text pairs collected under canonical visual conditions and achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks. However, their robustness to real-world weather conditions, and the stability of cross-modal semantic alignment under such structured perturbations, remain insufficiently studied. In this paper, we focus on rainy scenarios and introduce the first adversarial framework that exploits realistic weather to attack VLMs, using a two-stage, parameterized perturbation model based on semantic decoupling to analyze rain-induced shifts in decision-making. In Stage 1, we model the global effects of rainfall by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, we introduce structured rain variations by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and optimize the resulting non-differentiable weather space to induce stable semantic shifts. Operating in a non-pixel parameter space, our framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable. Experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. Ablations further confirm that illumination modeling and multi-scale raindrop structures are key drivers of these semantic shifts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KOCO-BENCH: Can Large Language Models Leverage Domain Knowledge in Software Development?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13240</link><description>arXiv:2601.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general programming but struggle with domain-specific software development, necessitating domain specialization methods for LLMs to learn and utilize domain knowledge and data. However, existing domain-specific code benchmarks cannot evaluate the effectiveness of domain specialization methods, which focus on assessing what knowledge LLMs possess rather than how they acquire and apply new knowledge, lacking explicit knowledge corpora for developing domain specialization methods. To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&amp;amp;A). Unlike previous benchmarks that only provide test sets for direct evaluation, KOCO-BENCH requires acquiring and applying diverse domain knowledge (APIs, rules, constraints, etc.) from knowledge corpora to solve evaluation tasks. Our evaluations reveal that KOCO-BENCH poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art LLMs. Even with domain specialization methods (e.g., SFT, RAG, kNN-LM) applied, improvements remain marginal. Best-performing coding agent, Claude Code, achieves only 34.2%, highlighting the urgent need for more effective domain specialization methods. We release KOCO-BENCH, evaluation code, and baselines to advance further research at https://github.com/jiangxxxue/KOCO-bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13240v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Comprehensive Evaluation of LLM Reasoning: From Single-Model to Multi-Agent Paradigms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13243</link><description>arXiv:2601.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as reasoning systems, where reasoning paradigms - such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and multi-agent systems (MAS) - play a critical role, yet their relative effectiveness and cost-accuracy trade-offs remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and unified evaluation of reasoning paradigms, spanning direct single-model generation, CoT-augmented single-model reasoning, and representative MAS workflows, characterizing their reasoning performance across a diverse suite of closed-form benchmarks. Beyond overall performance, we probe role-specific capability demands in MAS using targeted role isolation analyses, and analyze cost-accuracy trade-offs to identify which MAS workflows offer a favorable balance between cost and accuracy, and which incur prohibitive overhead for marginal gains. We further introduce MIMeBench, a new open-ended benchmark that targets two foundational yet underexplored semantic capabilities - semantic abstraction and contrastive discrimination - thereby providing an alternative evaluation axis beyond closed-form accuracy and enabling fine-grained assessment of semantic competence that is difficult to capture with existing benchmarks. Our results show that increased structural complexity does not consistently lead to improved reasoning performance, with its benefits being highly dependent on the properties and suitability of the reasoning paradigm itself. The codes are released at https://gitcode.com/HIT1920/OpenLLMBench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13243v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Instruction-Tuned Models Always Perform Better Than Base Models?

Abstract: Instruction finetuning is standard practice for improving LLM performance, yet it remains unclear whether it enhances reasoning or merely induces surface-level pattern matching. We investigate this by evaluating base and instruction-tuned models on standard math benchmarks, structurally perturbed variants, and domain-shifted tasks. Our analysis highlights two key (often overlooked) limitations of instruction tuning. First, the performance advantage is unstable and depends heavily on evaluation settings. In zero-shot CoT settings on GSM8K, base models consistently outperform instruction-tuned variants, with drops as high as 32.67\% (Llama3-70B). Instruction-tuned models only match or exceed this performance when provided with few-shot exemplars, suggesting a reliance on specific prompting patterns rather than intrinsic reasoning. Second, tuning gains are brittle under distribution shift. Our results show that base models surpass instruction-tuned variants on the domain-specific MedCalc benchmark. Additionally, instruction-tuned models show sharp declines on perturbed datasets, indicating sensitivity to prompt structure over robust reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13244v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aligning Agentic World Models via Knowledgeable Experience Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13247</link><description>arXiv:2601.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a critical modal disconnect: they possess vast semantic knowledge but lack the procedural grounding to respect the immutable laws of the physical world. Consequently, while these agents implicitly function as world models, their simulations often suffer from physical hallucinations-generating plans that are logically sound but physically unexecutable. Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion-based Inverse Model of a Distributed Tactile Sensor for Object Pose Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13250</link><description>arXiv:2601.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile sensing provides a promising sensing modality for object pose estimation in manipulation settings where visual information is limited due to occlusion or environmental effects. However, efficiently leveraging tactile data for estimation remains a challenge due to partial observability, with single observations corresponding to multiple possible contact configurations. This limits conventional estimation approaches largely tailored to vision. We propose to address these challenges by learning an inverse tactile sensor model using denoising diffusion. The model is conditioned on tactile observations from a distributed tactile sensor and trained in simulation using a geometric sensor model based on signed distance fields. Contact constraints are enforced during inference through single-step projection using distance and gradient information from the signed distance field. For online pose estimation, we integrate the inverse model with a particle filter through a proposal scheme that combines generated hypotheses with particles from the prior belief. Our approach is validated in simulated and real-world planar pose estimation settings, without access to visual data or tight initial pose priors. We further evaluate robustness to unmodeled contact and sensor dynamics for pose tracking in a box-pushing scenario. Compared to local sampling baselines, the inverse sensor model improves sampling efficiency and estimation accuracy while preserving multimodal beliefs across objects with varying tactile discriminability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13250v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Cosine Similarity: Taming Semantic Drift and Antonym Intrusion in a 15-Million Node Turkish Synonym Graph</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13251</link><description>arXiv:2601.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural embeddings have a notorious blind spot: they can't reliably tell synonyms apart from antonyms. Consequently, increasing similarity thresholds often fails to prevent opposites from being grouped together. We've built a large-scale semantic clustering system specifically designed to tackle this problem head on. Our pipeline chews through 15 million lexical items, evaluates a massive 520 million potential relationships, and ultimately generates 2.9 million high-precision semantic clusters. The system makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce a labeled dataset of 843,000 concept pairs spanning synonymy, antonymy, and co-hyponymy, constructed via Gemini 2.5-Flash LLM augmentation and verified using human-curated dictionary resources. Second, we propose a specialized three-way semantic relation discriminator that achieves 90% macro-F1, enabling robust disambiguation beyond raw embedding similarity. Third, we introduce a novel soft-to-hard clustering algorithm that mitigates semantic drift preventing erroneous transitive chains (e.g., hot -&gt; spicy -&gt; pain -&gt; depression) while simultaneously resolving polysemy. Our approach employs a topology-aware two-stage expansion-pruning procedure with topological voting, ensuring that each term is assigned to exactly one semantically coherent cluster. The resulting resource enables high-precision semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation, particularly for morphologically rich and low-resource languages where existing synonym databases remain sparse.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13251v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autonomous Navigation at the Nano-Scale: Algorithms, Architectures, and Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13252</link><description>arXiv:2601.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation for nano-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs) is governed by extreme Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints (with the weight &lt; 50 g and sub-100 mW onboard processor), distinguishing it fundamentally from standard robotic paradigms. This review synthesizes the state-of-the-art in sensing, computing, and control architectures designed specifically for these sub- 100mW computational envelopes. We critically analyse the transition from classical geometry-based methods to emerging "Edge AI" paradigms, including quantized deep neural networks deployed on ultra-low-power System-on-Chips (SoCs) and neuromorphic event-based control. Beyond algorithms, we evaluate the hardware-software co-design requisite for autonomy, covering advancements in dense optical flow, optimized Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and learning-based flight control. While significant progress has been observed in visual navigation and relative pose estimation, our analysis reveals persistent gaps in long-term endurance, robust obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments, and the "Sim-to-Real" transfer of reinforcement learning policies. This survey provides a roadmap for bridging these gaps, advocating for hybrid architectures that fuse lightweight classical control with data-driven perception to enable fully autonomous, agile nano-UAVs in GPS-denied environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13252v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Hybrid Protocol for Large-Scale Semantic Dataset Generation in Low-Resource Languages: The Turkish Semantic Relations Corpus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13253</link><description>arXiv:2601.13253v1 Announce Type: new

The resulting dataset comprises 843,000 unique Turkish semantic pairs across three relationship types (synonyms, antonyms, co-hyponyms) representing a 10x scale increase over existing resources at minimal cost ($65). We validate the dataset through two downstream tasks: an embedding model achieving 90% top-1 retrieval accuracy and a classification model attaining 90% F1-macro. Our scalable protocol addresses critical data scarcity in Turkish NLP and demonstrates applicability to other low-resource languages.

Abstract: The numerical solution of high dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is severely constrained by the curse of dimensionality (CoD), rendering classical grid--based methods impractical beyond a few dimensions. In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a promising mesh free alternative, enabling the approximation of PDE solutions in tens to thousands of dimensions. This review provides a tutorial--oriented introduction to neural--network--based methods for solving high dimensional parabolic PDEs, emphasizing conceptual clarity and methodological connections. We organize the literature around three unifying paradigms: (i) PDE residual--based approaches, including physicsinformed neural networks and their high dimensional variants; (ii) stochastic methods derived from Feynman--Kac and backward stochastic differential equation formulations; and (iii) hybrid derivative--free random difference approaches designed to alleviate the computational cost of derivatives in high dimensions. For each paradigm, we outline the underlying mathematical formulation, algorithmic implementation, and practical strengths and limitations. Representative benchmark problems--including Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman and Black--Scholes equations in up to 1000 dimensions --illustrate the scalability, effectiveness, and accuracy of the methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future directions for reliable and scalable solvers of high dimensional PDEs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13256v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stop Taking Tokenizers for Granted: They Are Core Design Decisions in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13260</link><description>arXiv:2601.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization underlies every large language model, yet it remains an under-theorized and inconsistently designed component. Common subword approaches such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) offer scalability but often misalign with linguistic structure, amplify bias, and waste capacity across languages and domains. This paper reframes tokenization as a core modeling decision rather than a preprocessing step. We argue for a context-aware framework that integrates tokenizer and model co-design, guided by linguistic, domain, and deployment considerations. Standardized evaluation and transparent reporting are essential to make tokenization choices accountable and comparable. Treating tokenization as a core design problem, not a technical afterthought, can yield language technologies that are fairer, more efficient, and more adaptable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13260v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CURE-Med: Curriculum-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Multilingual Medical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13262</link><description>arXiv:2601.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown to perform well on monolingual mathematical and commonsense reasoning, they remain unreliable for multilingual medical reasoning applications, hindering their deployment in multilingual healthcare settings. We address this by first introducing CUREMED-BENCH, a high-quality multilingual medical reasoning dataset with open-ended reasoning queries with a single verifiable answer, spanning thirteen languages, including underrepresented languages such as Amharic, Yoruba, and Swahili. Building on this dataset, we propose CURE-MED, a curriculum-informed reinforcement learning framework that integrates code-switching-aware supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization to jointly improve logical correctness and language stability. Across thirteen languages, our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines and scales effectively, achieving 85.21% language consistency and 54.35% logical correctness at 7B parameters, and 94.96% language consistency and 70.04% logical correctness at 32B parameters. These results support reliable and equitable multilingual medical reasoning in LLMs. The code and dataset are available at https://cure-med.github.io/</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation of 3D Ultrasound Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13263</link><description>arXiv:2601.13263v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across natural language processing tasks, yet their widespread deployment raises pressing concerns around privacy, copyright, security, and bias. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising paradigm for selectively removing knowledge or data from trained models without full retraining. In this survey, we provide a structured overview of unlearning methods for LLMs, categorizing existing approaches into data-centric, parameter-centric, architecture-centric, hybrid, and other strategies. We also review the evaluation ecosystem, including benchmarks, metrics, and datasets designed to measure forgetting effectiveness, knowledge retention, and robustness. Finally, we outline key challenges and open problems, such as scalable efficiency, formal guarantees, cross-language and multimodal unlearning, and robustness against adversarial relearning. By synthesizing current progress and highlighting open directions, this paper aims to serve as a roadmap for developing reliable and responsible unlearning techniques in large language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13264v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Query Complexity of Local Search in Rounds on General Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13266</link><description>arXiv:2601.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the query complexity of finding a local minimum in $t$ rounds on general graphs. More precisely, given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and oracle access to an unknown function $f : V \to \mathbb{R}$, the goal is to find a local minimum--a vertex $v$ such that $f(v) \leq f(u)$ for all $(u,v) \in E$--using at most $t$ rounds of interaction with the oracle. The query complexity is well understood on grids, but much less is known beyond. This abstract problem captures many optimization tasks, such as finding a local minimum of a loss function during neural network training.
  For each graph with $n$ vertices, we prove a deterministic upper bound of $O(t n^{1/t} (s\Delta)^{1-1/t})$, where $s$ is the separation number and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We complement this result with a randomized lower bound of $\Omega(t n^{1/t}-t)$ that holds for any connected graph. We also find that parallel steepest descent with a warm start provides improved bounds for graphs with high separation number and bounded degree.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving the Safety and Trustworthiness of Medical AI via Multi-Agent Evaluation Loops</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13268</link><description>arXiv:2601.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in healthcare, yet ensuring their ethical integrity and safety compliance remains a major barrier to clinical deployment. This work introduces a multi-agent refinement framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of medical LLMs through structured, iterative alignment. Our system combines two generative models - DeepSeek R1 and Med-PaLM - with two evaluation agents, LLaMA 3.1 and Phi-4, which assess responses using the American Medical Association's (AMA) Principles of Medical Ethics and a five-tier Safety Risk Assessment (SRA-5) protocol. We evaluate performance across 900 clinically diverse queries spanning nine ethical domains, measuring convergence efficiency, ethical violation reduction, and domain-specific risk behavior. Results demonstrate that DeepSeek R1 achieves faster convergence (mean 2.34 vs. 2.67 iterations), while Med-PaLM shows superior handling of privacy-sensitive scenarios. The iterative multi-agent loop achieved an 89% reduction in ethical violations and a 92% risk downgrade rate, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach. This study presents a scalable, regulator-aligned, and cost-efficient paradigm for governing medical AI safety.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13268v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-level Monte Carlo Dropout for Efficient Uncertainty Quantification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13272</link><description>arXiv:2601.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) framework for uncertainty quantification with Monte Carlo dropout.

We construct coupled coarse--fine estimators by reusing dropout masks across fidelities, yielding telescoping MLMC estimators for both predictive means and predictive variances that remain unbiased for the corresponding dropout-induced quantities while reducing sampling variance at fixed evaluation budget. We derive explicit bias, variance and effective cost expressions, together with sample-allocation rules across levels. Numerical experiments on forward and inverse PINNs--Uzawa benchmarks confirm the predicted variance rates and demonstrate efficiency gains over single-level MC-dropout at matched cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13272v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Safe Navigation in Cluttered Environments Via Spline-Based Harmonic Potential Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13273</link><description>arXiv:2601.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete motion-planning mechanism that ensures target tracking and obstacle avoidance in a cluttered environment.

  For each cell, we construct a harmonic potential surface induced by a Dirichlet boundary condition given as a cardinal B-spline curve. A detailed analysis of the curve behavior (periodicity, support) and of the associated control point selection allows us to explicitly compute these harmonic potential surfaces, from which we subsequently derive the corresponding control policy. We illustrate that the resulting construction funnels the agent safely along the chain of cells from the starting point to the target.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Balancing Classification and Calibration Performance in Decision-Making LLMs via Calibration Aware Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13284</link><description>arXiv:2601.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in decision-making tasks, where not only accuracy but also reliable confidence estimates are essential. Well-calibrated confidence enables downstream systems to decide when to trust a model and when to defer to fallback mechanisms. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of calibration in two widely used fine-tuning paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives. Based on this insight, we propose a calibration-aware reinforcement learning formulation that directly adjusts decision-token probabilities. Our method preserves RLVR's accuracy level while mitigating overconfidence, reducing ECE scores up to 9 points.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A BERTology View of LLM Orchestrations: Token- and Layer-Selective Probes for Efficient Single-Pass Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13288</link><description>arXiv:2601.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production LLM systems often rely on separate models for safety and other classification-heavy steps, increasing latency, VRAM footprint, and operational complexity. We instead reuse computation already paid for by the serving LLM: we train lightweight probes on its hidden states and predict labels in the same forward pass used for generation. We frame classification as representation selection over the full token-layer hidden-state tensor, rather than committing to a fixed token or fixed layer (e.g., first-token logits or final-layer pooling). To implement this, we introduce a two-stage aggregator that (i) summarizes tokens within each layer and (ii) aggregates across layer summaries to form a single representation for classification. We instantiate this template with direct pooling, a 100K-parameter scoring-attention gate, and a downcast multi-head self-attention (MHA) probe with up to 35M trainable parameters.

However, many existing pipelines still classify each message's credibility based on the reputation of its associated domain names or its lexical features. Such methods work well on traditional long-form news articles published by well-known sources, but high-risk posts on Telegram are short and URL-sparse, leading to failures for link-based and standard TF-IDF models. To this end, we propose the TAG2CRED pipeline, a method designed for such short, convoluted messages. Our model will directly score each post based on the tags assigned to the text. We designed a concise label system that covers the dimensions of theme, claim type, call to action, and evidence. The fine-tuned large language model (LLM) assigns tags to messages and then maps these tags to calibrated risk scores in the [0,1] interval through L2-regularized logistic regression. We evaluated 87,936 Telegram messages associated with Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), using URL masking and domain disjoint splits. The results showed that the ROC-AUC of the TAG2CRED model reached 0.871, the macro-F1 value was 0.787, and the Brier score was 0.167, outperforming the baseline TF-IDF (macro-F1 value 0.737, Brier score 0.248); at the same time, the number of features used in this model is much smaller, and the generalization ability on infrequent domains is stronger. The performance of the stacked ensemble model (TF-IDF + TAG2CRED + SBERT) was further improved over the baseline SBERT. ROC-AUC reached 0.901, and the macro-F1 value was 0.813 (Brier score 0.114). This indicates that style labels and lexical features may capture different but complementary dimensions of information risk.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13294v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CooperBench: Why Coding Agents Cannot be Your Teammates Yet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13295</link><description>arXiv:2601.13295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving team conflicts requires not only task-specific competence, but also social intelligence to find common ground and build consensus. As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enginuity: Building an Open Multi-Domain Dataset of Complex Engineering Diagrams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13299</link><description>arXiv:2601.13299v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) is critical for understanding their capabilities, limitations, and robustness. In addition to interface artifacts, prior studies have shown that LLM decisions can be influenced by directive signals such as social cues, framing, and instructions. In this work, we introduce option injection, a benchmarking approach that augments the multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) interface with an additional option containing a misleading directive, leveraging standardized choice structure and scalable evaluation. We construct OI-Bench, a benchmark of 3,000 questions spanning knowledge, reasoning, and commonsense tasks, with 16 directive types covering social compliance, bonus framing, threat framing, and instructional interference. This setting combines manipulation of the choice interface with directive-based interference, enabling systematic assessment of model susceptibility. We evaluate 12 LLMs to analyze attack success rates, behavioral responses, and further investigate mitigation strategies ranging from inference-time prompting to post-training alignment. Experimental results reveal substantial vulnerabilities and heterogeneous robustness across models. OI-Bench is expected to support more systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to directive interference within choice-based interfaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13300v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Verifying Local Robustness of Pruned Safety-Critical Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13303</link><description>arXiv:2601.13303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal verification of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is essential for safety-critical applications, ranging from surgical robotics to NASA JPL autonomous systems. However, the computational cost of verifying large-scale models remains a significant barrier to adoption. This paper investigates the impact of pruning on formal local robustness certificates with different ratios. Using the state-of-the-art $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN verifier, we evaluate ResNet4 models across varying pruning ratios on MNIST and, more importantly, on the NASA JPL Mars Frost Identification datasets. Our findings demonstrate a non-linear relationship: light pruning (40%) in MNIST and heavy pruning (70%-90%) in JPL improve verifiability, allowing models to outperform unpruned baselines in proven $L_\infty$ robustness properties. This suggests that reduced connectivity simplifies the search space for formal solvers and that the optimal pruning ratio varies significantly between datasets. This research highlights the complex nature of model compression, offering critical insights into selecting the optimal pruning ratio for deploying efficient, yet formally verified, DNNs in high-stakes environments where reliability is non-negotiable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13303v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CausalSpatial: A Benchmark for Object-Centric Causal Spatial Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13304</link><description>arXiv:2601.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can look at a static scene and instantly predict what happens next -- will moving this object cause a collision? We call this ability Causal Spatial Reasoning. However, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) cannot do this, as they remain largely restricted to static spatial perception, struggling to answer "what-if" questions in a 3D scene. We introduce CausalSpatial, a diagnostic benchmark evaluating whether models can anticipate consequences of object motions across four tasks: Collision, Compatibility, Occlusion, and Trajectory. Results expose a severe gap: humans score 84% while GPT-5 achieves only 54%. Why do MLLMs fail? Our analysis uncovers a fundamental deficiency: models over-rely on textual chain-of-thought reasoning that drifts from visual evidence, producing fluent but spatially ungrounded hallucinations. To address this, we propose the Causal Object World model (COW), a framework that externalizes the simulation process by generating videos of hypothetical dynamics. With explicit visual cues of causality, COW enables models to ground their reasoning in physical reality rather than linguistic priors.

Abstract: Climate discourse online plays a crucial role in shaping public understanding of climate change and influencing political and policy outcomes. However, climate communication unfolds across structurally distinct platforms with fundamentally different incentive structures: paid advertising ecosystems incentivize targeted, strategic persuasion, while public social media platforms host largely organic, user-driven discourse. Existing computational studies typically analyze these environments in isolation, limiting our ability to distinguish institutional messaging from public expression. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of climate discourse across paid advertisements on Meta (previously known as Facebook) and public posts on Bluesky from July 2024 to September 2025. We introduce an interpretable, end-to-end thematic discovery and assignment framework that clusters texts by semantic similarity and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate concise, human-interpretable theme labels. We evaluate the quality of the induced themes against traditional topic modeling baselines using both human judgments and an LLM-based evaluator, and further validate their semantic coherence through downstream stance prediction and theme-guided retrieval tasks. Applying the resulting themes, we characterize systematic differences between paid climate messaging and public climate discourse and examine how thematic prevalence shifts around major political events. Our findings show that platform-level incentives are reflected in the thematic structure, stance alignment, and temporal responsiveness of climate narratives. While our empirical analysis focuses on climate communication, the proposed framework is designed to support comparative narrative analysis across heterogeneous communication environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13317v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Arab Voices: Mapping Standard and Dialectal Arabic Speech Technology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13319</link><description>arXiv:2601.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) speech data vary widely in domain coverage, dialect labeling practices, and recording conditions, complicating cross-dataset comparison and model evaluation. To characterize this landscape, we conduct a computational analysis of linguistic ``dialectness'' alongside objective proxies of audio quality on the training splits of widely used DA corpora. We find substantial heterogeneity both in acoustic conditions and in the strength and consistency of dialectal signals across datasets, underscoring the need for standardized characterization beyond coarse labels. To reduce fragmentation and support reproducible evaluation, we introduce Arab Voices, a standardized framework for DA ASR. Arab Voices provides unified access to 31 datasets spanning 14 dialects, with harmonized metadata and evaluation utilities. We further benchmark a range of recent ASR systems, establishing strong baselines for modern DA ASR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13319v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Verifying First-Order Temporal Properties of Infinite-State Systems via Timers and Rankings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13325</link><description>arXiv:2601.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified deductive verification framework for first-order temporal properties based on well-founded rankings, where verification conditions are discharged using SMT solvers. To that end, we introduce a novel reduction from verification of arbitrary temporal properties to verification of termination. Our reduction augments the system with prophecy timer variables that predict the number of steps along a trace until the next time certain temporal formulas, including the negated property, hold. In contrast to standard tableaux-based reductions, which reduce the problem to fair termination, our reduction does not introduce fairness assumptions. To verify termination of the augmented system, we follow the traditional approach of assigning each state a rank from a well-founded set and showing that the rank decreases in every transition. We leverage the recently proposed formalism of implicit rankings to express and automatically verify the decrease of rank using SMT solvers, even when the rank is not expressible in first-order logic. We extend implicit rankings from finite to infinite domains, enabling verification of more general systems and making them applicable to the augmented systems generated by our reduction, which allows us to exploit the decrease of timers in termination proofs. We evaluate our technique on a range of temporal verification tasks from previous works, giving simple, intuitive proofs for them within our framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13325v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PepEDiff: Zero-Shot Peptide Binder Design via Protein Embedding Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13327</link><description>arXiv:2601.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PepEDiff, a novel peptide binder generator that designs binding sequences given a target receptor protein sequence and its pocket residues. Peptide binder generation is critical in therapeutic and biochemical applications, yet many existing methods rely heavily on intermediate structure prediction, adding complexity and limiting sequence diversity. Our approach departs from this paradigm by generating binder sequences directly in a continuous latent space derived from a pretrained protein embedding model, without relying on predicted structures, thereby improving structural and sequence diversity. To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space. We evaluate PepEDiff on TIGIT, a challenging target with a large, flat protein-protein interaction interface that lacks a druggable pocket. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across benchmark tests and in the TIGIT case study, demonstrating its potential as a general, structure-free framework for zero-shot peptide binder design.

Abstract: Relative to English, low-resource languages suffer from substantial tokenization premiums in modern LMs, meaning that it generally requires several times as many tokens to encode a sentence in a low-resource language than to encode the analogous sentence in English. This tokenization premium results in increased API and energy costs and reduced effective context windows for these languages. In this paper we analyze the tokenizers of ten popular LMs to better understand their designs and per-language tokenization premiums. We also propose a mechanism to reduce tokenization premiums in pre-trained models, by post-hoc additions to the token vocabulary that coalesce multi-token characters into single tokens. We apply this methodology to 12 low-resource languages, demonstrating that the original and compressed inputs often have similar last hidden states when run through the Llama 3.2 1B model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RegCheck: A tool for automating comparisons between study registrations and papers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13330</link><description>arXiv:2601.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across the social and medical sciences, researchers recognize that specifying planned research activities (i.e., 'registration') prior to the commencement of research has benefits for both the transparency and rigour of science. Despite this, evidence suggests that study registrations frequently go unexamined, minimizing their effectiveness. In a way this is no surprise: manually checking registrations against papers is labour- and time-intensive, requiring careful reading across formats and expertise across domains. The advent of AI unlocks new possibilities in facilitating this activity. We present RegCheck, a modular LLM-assisted tool designed to help researchers, reviewers, and editors from across scientific disciplines compare study registrations with their corresponding papers. Importantly, RegCheck keeps human expertise and judgement in the loop by (i) ensuring that users are the ones who determine which features should be compared, and (ii) presenting the most relevant text associated with each feature to the user, facilitating (rather than replacing) human discrepancy judgements. RegCheck also generates shareable reports with unique RegCheck IDs, enabling them to be easily shared and verified by other users. RegCheck is designed to be adaptable across scientific domains, as well as registration and publication formats. In this paper we provide an overview of the motivation, workflow, and design principles of RegCheck, and we discuss its potential as an extensible infrastructure for reproducible science with an example use case.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MultiST: A Cross-Attention-Based Multimodal Model for Spatial Transcriptomic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13331</link><description>arXiv:2601.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables transcriptome-wide profiling while preserving the spatial context of tissues, offering unprecedented opportunities to study tissue organization and cell-cell interactions in situ. Despite recent advances, existing methods often lack effective integration of histological morphology with molecular profiles, relying on shallow fusion strategies or omitting tissue images altogether, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous spatial domain boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose MultiST, a unified multimodal framework that jointly models spatial topology, gene expression, and tissue morphology through cross-attention-based fusion. MultiST employs graph-based gene encoders with adversarial alignment to learn robust spatial representations, while integrating color-normalized histological features to capture molecular-morphological dependencies and refine domain boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method on 13 diverse ST datasets spanning two organs, including human brain cortex and breast cancer tissue. MultiST yields spatial domains with clearer and more coherent boundaries than existing methods, leading to more stable pseudotime trajectories and more biologically interpretable cell-cell interaction patterns. The MultiST framework and source code are available at https://github.com/LabJunBMI/MultiST.git.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13331v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SEER: Spectral Entropy Encoding of Roles for Context-Aware Attention-Based Design Pattern Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13334</link><description>arXiv:2601.13334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SEER, an upgraded version of our prior method Context Is All You Need for detecting Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns from source code. The earlier approach modeled code as attention-ready sequences that blended lightweight structure with behavioral context; however, it lacked explicit role disambiguation within classes and treated call edges uniformly. SEER addresses these limitations with two principled additions: (i) a spectral-entropy role encoder that derives per-member role embeddings from the Laplacian spectrum of each class's interaction graph, and (ii) a time-weighted calling context that assigns empirically calibrated duration priors to method categories (e.g., constructors, getters/setters, static calls, virtual dispatch, cloning). Together, these components sharpen the model's notion of "who does what" and "how much it matters," while remaining portable across languages with minimal adaptation and fully compatible with Transformer-based sequence encoders. Importantly, SEER does not "force" a win by capacity or data; it nudges the classifier, steering attention toward role-consistent and temporally calibrated signals that matter most. We evaluate SEER on PyDesignNet (1,832 files, 35,000 sequences, 23 GoF patterns) and observe consistent gains over our previous system: macro-F1 increases from 92.47% to 93.20% and accuracy from 92.52% to 93.98%, with macro-precision 93.98% and macro-recall 92.52%. Beyond aggregate metrics, SEER reduces false positives by nearly 20%, a decisive improvement that strengthens its robustness and practical reliability. Moreover, SEER yields interpretable, symbol-level attributions aligned with canonical roles, exhibits robustness under small graph perturbations, and shows stable calibration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reduction for Structured Concurrent Programs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13341</link><description>arXiv:2601.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commutativity reasoning based on Lipton's movers is a powerful technique for verification of concurrent programs. The idea is to define a program transformation that preserves a subset of the initial set of interleavings, which is sound modulo reorderings of commutative actions. Scaling commutativity reasoning to routinely-used features in software systems, such as procedures and parallel composition, remains a significant challenge.
  In this work, we introduce a novel reduction technique for structured concurrent programs that unifies two key advances. First, we present a reduction strategy that soundly replaces parallel composition with sequential composition. Second, we generalize Lipton's reduction to support atomic sections containing (potentially recursive) procedure calls. Crucially, these two foundational strategies can be composed arbitrarily, greatly expanding the scope and flexibility of reduction-based reasoning. We implemented this technique in Civl and demonstrated its effectiveness on a number of challenging case studies, including a snapshot object, a fault-tolerant and linearizable register, the FLASH cache coherence protocol, and a non-trivial variant of Two-Phase Commit.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13341v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privacy Starts with UI: Privacy Patterns and Designer Perspectives in UI/UX Practice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13342</link><description>arXiv:2601.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of Human-Computer Interaction, privacy is often seen as a core issue, and it has been explored directly in connection with User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design. We systematically investigate the key considerations and factors for privacy in UI/UX, drawing upon the extant literature and 15 semi-structured interviews with experts working in the field. These insights lead to the synthesis of 14 primary design considerations for privacy in UI/UX, as well as 14 key factors under four main axes affecting privacy work therein. From these findings, we produce our main research artifact, a UI/UX Privacy Pattern Catalog, which we validate in a series of two interactive workshops and one online survey with UI/UX practitioners. Our work not only systematizes a field growing in both attention and importance, but it also provides an actionable and expert-validated artifact to guide UI/UX designers in realizing privacy-preserving UI/UX design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13342v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Words That Can't Be Shared: Exploring the Design of Unsent Messages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13343</link><description>arXiv:2601.13343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People often have things they want to say but hold back in conversations, fearing vulnerability or social consequences. Online, this restraint can take a distinctive form: even when such thoughts are written out - in moments of anger, guilt, or longing - people may choose to withhold them, leaving them unsent. This process is underexamined; we investigate the experience of writing such messages within people's digital communications. We find that unsent messages become expressive containers for suppressed feelings, where the act of writing creates a pause for reflection on the relationship and oneself. Building on these insights, we probe into how the design of the writing platforms of unsent messages affects people's experiences and motivations. Speculating with participants on nine evocative variants of a note-taking platform, we highlight how design shapes the emotional, temporal, and ritualistic qualities of unsent messages, revealing subtle tensions between people's social desires and communicative actions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13343v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlipFlop: A Static Analysis-based Energy Optimization Framework for GPU Kernels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13345</link><description>arXiv:2601.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as Large Language Models, are primarily driven and executed by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These GPU programs (kernels) consume substantial amounts of energy, yet software developers often lack the hardware expertise and ad hoc knowledge required to optimize for power efficiency. We propose FlipFlop, a framework using static code analysis to predict energy consumption and recommend Pareto-optimal thread block configurations considering both power consumption and execution time. Our framework requires no runtime execution and analyzes PTX code, a low-level instruction set for CUDA-enabled GPUs. It is validated across a diverse set of GPUs and kernels, including multi-head attention, convolution, and matrix multiplication. FlipFlop achieves 83% accuracy in identifying locally optimal energy-efficient configurations, while also minimizing developer effort by reducing the optimization search space by 93.4%. For multi-head attention kernels, it yields up to 79% energy savings and 106% throughput gains relative to NVIDIA's occupancy heuristic. By integrating static analysis with real-time monitoring and providing explainable optimization guidance, FlipFlop empowers developers to create sustainable, high-performance GPU software which minimizes environmental and computational costs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13345v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AfroScope: A Framework for Studying the Linguistic Landscape of Africa</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13346</link><description>arXiv:2601.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language Identification (LID) is the task of determining the language of a given text and is a fundamental preprocessing step that affects the reliability of downstream NLP applications. While recent work has expanded LID coverage for African languages, existing approaches remain limited in (i) the number of supported languages and (ii) their ability to make fine-grained distinctions among closely related varieties. We introduce AfroScope, a unified framework for African LID that includes AfroScope-Data, a dataset covering 713 African languages, and AfroScope-Models, a suite of strong LID models with broad language coverage. To better distinguish highly confusable languages, we propose a hierarchical classification approach that leverages Mirror-Serengeti, a specialized embedding model targeting 29 closely related or geographically proximate languages. This approach improves macro F1 by 4.55 on this confusable subset compared to our best base model. Finally, we analyze cross linguistic transfer and domain effects, offering guidance for building robust African LID systems. We position African LID as an enabling technology for large scale measurement of Africas linguistic landscape in digital text and release AfroScope-Data and AfroScope-Models publicly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Scalable Sequential Framework for Dynamic Inverse Problems via Model Parameter Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13347</link><description>arXiv:2601.13347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale dynamic inverse problems are often ill-posed due to model complexity and the high dimensionality of the unknown parameters. Regularization is commonly employed to mitigate ill-posedness by incorporating prior information and structural constraints. However, classical regularization formulations are frequently infeasible in this setting due to prohibitive memory requirements, necessitating sequential methods that process data and state information online, eliminating the need to form the full space-time problem. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient framework for reconstructing dynamic sequences of undersampled images from computerized tomography data that requires minimal hyperparameter tuning. The approach is based on a prior-informed, dimension-reduced Kalman filter with smoothing. While well suited for dynamic image reconstruction, practical deployment is challenging when the state transition model and covariance parameters must be initialized without prior knowledge and estimated in a single pass. To address these limitations, we integrate regularized motion models with expectation-maximization strategies for the estimation of state transition dynamics and error covariances within the Kalman filtering framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on limited-angle and single-shot computerized tomography problems, highlighting improvements in reconstruction accuracy, memory efficiency, and computational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13347v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The AI Genie Phenomenon and Three Types of AI Chatbot Addiction: Escapist Roleplays, Pseudosocial Companions, and Epistemic Rabbit Holes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13348</link><description>arXiv:2601.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports on generative AI chatbot use raise concerns about its addictive potential. An in-depth understanding is imperative to minimize risks, yet AI chatbot addiction remains poorly understood. This study examines how to characterize AI chatbot addiction--why users become addicted, the symptoms commonly reported, and the distinct types it comprises. We conducted a thematic analysis of Reddit entries (n=334) across 14 subreddits where users narrated their experiences with addictive AI chatbot use, followed by an exploratory data analysis. We found: (1) users' dependence tied to the "AI Genie" phenomenon--users can get exactly anything they want with minimal effort--and marked by symptoms that align with addiction literature, (2) three distinct addiction types: Escapist Roleplay, Pseudosocial Companion, and Epistemic Rabbit Hole, (3) sexual content involved in multiple cases, and (4) recovery strategies' perceived helpfulness differ between addiction types. Our work lays empirical groundwork to inform future strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and intervention.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13348v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Mapping : Domain-Invariant Representations via Spectral Embedding of Optimal Transport Plans</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13350</link><description>arXiv:2601.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributional shifts between training and inference time data remain a central challenge in machine learning, often leading to poor performance. It motivated the study of principled approaches for domain alignment, such as optimal transport based unsupervised domain adaptation, that relies on approximating Monge map using transport plans, which is sensitive to the transport problem regularization strategy and hyperparameters, and might yield biased domains alignment. In this work, we propose to interpret smoothed transport plans as adjacency matrices of bipartite graphs connecting source to target domain and derive domain-invariant samples' representations through spectral embedding. We evaluate our approach on acoustic adaptation benchmarks for music genre recognition, music-speech discrimination, as well as electrical cable defect detection and classification tasks using time domain reflection in different diagnosis settings, achieving overall strong performances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13350v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Scalable Federated Container Orchestration: The CODECO Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13351</link><description>arXiv:2601.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents CODECO, a federated orchestration framework for Kubernetes that addresses the limitations of cloud-centric deployment. CODECO adopts a data-compute-network co-orchestration approach to support heterogeneous infrastructures, mobility, and multi-provider operation.
  CODECO extends Kubernetes with semantic application models, partition-based federation, and AI-assisted decision support, enabling context-aware placement and adaptive management of applications and their micro-services across federated environments. A hybrid governance model combines centralized policy enforcement with decentralized execution and learning to preserve global coherence while supporting far Edge autonomy.

Abstract: Large language models are strong sequence predictors, yet standard inference relies on immutable context histories. After making an error at generation step t, the model lacks an updatable memory mechanism that improves predictions for step t+1. We propose LLM-as-RNN, an inference-only framework that turns a frozen LLM into a recurrent predictor by representing its hidden state as natural-language memory. This state, implemented as a structured system-prompt summary, is updated at each timestep via feedback-driven text rewrites, enabling learning without parameter updates. Under a fixed token budget, LLM-as-RNN corrects errors and retains task-relevant patterns, effectively performing online learning through language. We evaluate the method on three sequential benchmarks in healthcare, meteorology, and finance across Llama, Gemma, and GPT model families. LLM-as-RNN significantly outperforms zero-shot, full-history, and MemPrompt baselines, improving predictive accuracy by 6.5% on average, while producing interpretable, human-readable learning traces absent in standard context accumulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Guidelines for the Creation of an Annotated Corpus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13353</link><description>arXiv:2601.13353v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Misophonia, characterized by intense negative reactions to specific sounds or related visual cues, remains poorly recognized in clinical settings yet profoundly affects daily life. This study examines how individuals with misophonia experience and sometimes avoid technology that amplifies their triggers. Drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews with U.S. adults recruited from online communities, we explore how social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, along with remote communication tools like Zoom and Discord, shape coping strategies and patterns of non-use. Participants described frequent distress from uncontrollable audiovisual content and food-related behaviors during virtual gatherings. We propose design interventions -- including channel-specific audio-visual controls, real-time trigger detection, and shared preference tools -- to better support misophonic users and reduce exclusion in increasingly mediated social and professional contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Relation of State Space Models and Hidden Markov Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13357</link><description>arXiv:2601.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational frameworks for modeling sequential data with latent variables and are widely used in signal processing, control theory, and machine learning. Despite their shared temporal structure, they differ fundamentally in the nature of their latent states, probabilistic assumptions, inference procedures, and training paradigms. Recently, deterministic state space models have re-emerged in natural language processing through architectures such as S4 and Mamba, raising new questions about the relationship between classical probabilistic SSMs, HMMs, and modern neural sequence models.
  In this paper, we present a unified and systematic comparison of HMMs, linear Gaussian state space models, Kalman filtering, and contemporary NLP state space models. We analyze their formulations through the lens of probabilistic graphical models, examine their inference algorithms -- including forward-backward inference and Kalman filtering -- and contrast their learning procedures via Expectation-Maximization and gradient-based optimization. By highlighting both structural similarities and semantic differences, we clarify when these models are equivalent, when they fundamentally diverge, and how modern NLP SSMs relate to classical probabilistic models. Our analysis bridges perspectives from control theory, probabilistic modeling, and modern deep learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13357v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Geometry of Thought: How Scale Restructures Reasoning In Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13358</link><description>arXiv:2601.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale does not uniformly improve reasoning - it restructures it. Analyzing 25,000+ chain-of-thought trajectories across four domains (Law, Science, Code, Math) and two scales (8B, 70B parameters), we discover that neural scaling laws trigger domain-specific phase transitions rather than uniform capability gains. Legal reasoning undergoes Crystallization: 45% collapse in representational dimensionality (d95: 501 -&gt; 274), 31% increase in trajectory alignment, and 10x manifold untangling. Scientific and mathematical reasoning remain Liquid - geometrically invariant despite 9x parameter increase. Code reasoning forms a discrete Lattice of strategic modes (silhouette: 0.13 -&gt; 0.42). This geometry predicts learnability. We introduce Neural Reasoning Operators - learned mappings from initial to terminal hidden states. In crystalline legal reasoning, our operator achieves 63.6% accuracy on held-out tasks via probe decoding, predicting reasoning endpoints without traversing intermediate states. We further identify a universal oscillatory signature (coherence ~ -0.4) invariant across domains and scales, suggesting attention and feedforward layers drive reasoning through opposing dynamics. These findings establish that the cost of thought is determined not by task difficulty but by manifold geometry - offering a blueprint for inference acceleration where topology permits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13358v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sockpuppetting: Jailbreaking LLMs Without Optimization Through Output Prefix Injection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13359</link><description>arXiv:2601.13359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As open-weight large language models (LLMs) increase in capabilities, safeguarding them against malicious prompts and understanding possible attack vectors becomes ever more important. While automated jailbreaking methods like GCG [Zou et al., 2023] remain effective, they often require substantial computational resources and specific expertise. We introduce "sockpuppetting'', a simple method for jailbreaking open-weight LLMs by inserting an acceptance sequence (e.g., "Sure, here is how to...'') at the start of a model's output and allowing it to complete the response. Requiring only a single line of code and no optimization, sockpuppetting achieves up to 80% higher attack success rate (ASR) than GCG on Qwen3-8B in per-prompt comparisons. We also explore a hybrid approach that optimizes the adversarial suffix within the assistant message block rather than the user prompt, increasing ASR by 64% over GCG on Llama-3.1-8B in a prompt-agnostic setting. The results establish sockpuppetting as an effective low-cost attack accessible to unsophisticated adversaries, highlighting the need for defences against output-prefix injection in open-weight models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CLEAR: A Semantic-Geometric Terrain Abstraction for Large-Scale Unstructured Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13361</link><description>arXiv:2601.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon navigation in unstructured environments demands terrain abstractions that scale to tens of km$^2$ while preserving semantic and geometric structure, a combination existing methods fail to achieve. Grids scale poorly; quadtrees misalign with terrain boundaries; neither encodes landcover semantics essential for traversability-aware planning. This yields infeasible or unreliable paths for autonomous ground vehicles operating over 10+ km$^2$ under real-time constraints. CLEAR (Connected Landcover Elevation Abstract Representation) couples boundary-aware spatial decomposition with recursive plane fitting to produce convex, semantically aligned regions encoded as a terrain-aware graph. Evaluated on maps spanning 9-100~km$^2$ using a physics-based simulator, CLEAR achieves up to 10x faster planning than raw grids with only 6.7% cost overhead and delivers 6-9% shorter, more reliable paths than other abstraction baselines. These results highlight CLEAR's scalability and utility for long-range navigation in applications such as disaster response, defense, and planetary exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13361v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time 4D Radar Perception for Robust Human Detection in Harsh Enclosed Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13364</link><description>arXiv:2601.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for generating controlled, multi-level dust concentrations in a highly cluttered environment representative of harsh, enclosed environments, such as underground mines, road tunnels, or collapsed buildings, enabling repeatable mm-wave propagation studies under severe electromagnetic constraints. We also present a new 4D mmWave radar dataset, augmented by camera and LiDAR, illustrating how dust particles and reflective surfaces jointly impact the sensing functionality. To address these challenges, we develop a threshold-based noise filtering framework leveraging key radar parameters (RCS, velocity, azimuth, elevation) to suppress ghost targets and mitigate strong multipath reflections at the raw data level. Building on the filtered point clouds, a cluster-level, rule-based classification pipeline exploits radar semantics-velocity, RCS, and volumetric spread-to achieve reliable, real-time pedestrian detection without extensive domainspecific training. Experimental results confirm that this integrated approach significantly enhances clutter mitigation, detection robustness, and overall system resilience in dust-laden mining environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13364v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CausationEntropy: Pythonic Optimal Causation Entropy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13365</link><description>arXiv:2601.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal Causation Entropy (oCSE) is a robust causal network modeling technique that reveals causal networks from dynamical systems and coupled oscillators, distinguishing direct from indirect paths. CausationEntropy is a Python package that implements oCSE and several of its significant optimizations and methodological extensions. In this paper, we introduce the version 1.1 release of CausationEntropy, which includes new synthetic data generators, plotting tools, and several advanced information-theoretical causal network discovery algorithms with criteria for estimating Gaussian, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), geometric k-nearest neighbors (geometric-kNN), kernel density (KDE) and Poisson entropic estimators. The package is easy to install from the PyPi software repository, is thoroughly documented, supplemented with extensive code examples, and is modularly structured to support future additions. The entire codebase is released under the MIT license and is available on GitHub and through PyPi Repository. We expect this package to serve as a benchmark tool for causal discovery in complex dynamical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recurrent Confidence Chain: Temporal-Aware Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13368</link><description>arXiv:2601.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As reasoning modules, such as the chain-of-thought mechanism, are applied to large language models, they achieve strong performance on various tasks such as answering common-sense questions and solving math problems. The main challenge now is to assess the uncertainty of answers, which can help prevent misleading or serious hallucinations for users. Although current methods analyze long reasoning sequences by filtering unrelated tokens and examining potential connections between nearby tokens or sentences, the temporal spread of confidence is often overlooked. This oversight can lead to inflated overall confidence, even when earlier steps exhibit very low confidence. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates inter-step attention to analyze semantic correlations across steps. For handling long-horizon responses, we introduce a hidden confidence mechanism to retain historical confidence information, which is then combined with stepwise confidence to produce a more accurate overall estimate. We evaluate our method on the GAOKAO math benchmark and the CLadder causal reasoning dataset using mainstream open-source large language models. Our approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods by achieving a superior balance between predictive quality and calibration, demonstrated by strong performance on both Negative Log-Likelihood and Expected Calibration Error.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13368v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spherical Geometry Diffusion: Generating High-quality 3D Face Geometry via Sphere-anchored Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13371</link><description>arXiv:2601.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in text-to-3D face generation is achieving high-quality geometry. The core difficulty lies in the arbitrary and intricate distribution of vertices in 3D space, making it challenging for existing models to establish clean connectivity and resulting in suboptimal geometry. To address this, our core insight is to simplify the underlying geometric structure by constraining the distribution onto a simple and regular manifold, a topological sphere. Building on this, we first propose the Spherical Geometry Representation, a novel face representation that anchors geometric signals to uniform spherical coordinates. This guarantees a regular point distribution, from which the mesh connectivity can be robustly reconstructed. Critically, this canonical sphere can be seamlessly unwrapped into a 2D map, creating a perfect synergy with powerful 2D generative models. We then introduce Spherical Geometry Diffusion, a conditional diffusion framework built upon this 2D map. It enables diverse and controllable generation by jointly modeling geometry and texture, where the geometry explicitly conditions the texture synthesis process. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated through its success in a wide range of tasks: text-to-3D generation, face reconstruction, and text-based 3D editing. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods in geometric quality, textual fidelity, and inference efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13371v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Influence of Normative Theories of Ethics on the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act: A Transformer-Based Analysis Using Semantic Textual Similarity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13372</link><description>arXiv:2601.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the ethical grounding of the European Union Artificial Intelligence (EU AI) Act by using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) to analyze the alignment between normative ethical theories and regulatory language. Despite being regarded as a significant step toward regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and its emphasis on fundamental rights, the EU AI Act is not immune to moral criticism regarding its ethical foundations. Our work examines the impact of three major normative theories of ethics, virtue ethics, deontological ethics, and consequentialism, on the EU AI Act. We introduce the concept of influence, grounded in philosophical and chronological analysis, to examine the underlying relationship between the theories and the Act. As a proxy measure of this influence, we propose using STS to quantify the degree of alignment between the theories (influencers) and the Act (influencee). To capture intentional and operational ethical consistency, the Act was divided into two parts: the preamble and the statutory provisions. The textual descriptions of the theories were manually preprocessed to reduce semantic overlap and ensure a distinct representation of each theory. A heterogeneous embedding-level ensemble approach was employed, using five modified Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models built on the Transformer architecture to compute STS scores. These scores reflect the semantic alignment between various theories of ethics and the two components of the EU AI Act. The resulting similarity scores were evaluated using voting and averaging, with findings indicating that deontological ethics has the most significant overall influence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13372v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bounded Minds, Generative Machines: Envisioning Conversational AI that Works with Human Heuristics and Reduces Bias Risk</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13376</link><description>arXiv:2601.13376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational AI is rapidly becoming a primary interface for information seeking and decision making, yet most systems still assume idealized users. In practice, human reasoning is bounded by limited attention, uneven knowledge, and reliance on heuristics that are adaptive but bias-prone.

It identifies key directions for detecting cognitive vulnerability, supporting judgment under uncertainty, and evaluating conversational systems beyond factual accuracy, toward decision quality and cognitive robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13376v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Practical Insights into Semi-Supervised Object Detection Approaches</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13380</link><description>arXiv:2601.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning in data-scarce settings has recently gained significant attention in the research community. Semi-supervised object detection(SSOD) aims to improve detection performance by leveraging a large number of unlabeled images alongside a limited number of labeled images(a.k.a.,few-shot learning). In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison of three state-of-the-art SSOD approaches, including MixPL, Semi-DETR and Consistent-Teacher, with the goal of understanding how performance varies with the number of labeled images. We conduct experiments using the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, two popular object detection benchmarks which allow for standardized evaluation. In addition, we evaluate the SSOD approaches on a custom Beetle dataset which enables us to gain insights into their performance on specialized datasets with a smaller number of object categories. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, model size, and latency, providing insights into which methods are best suited for low-data regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13380v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Lightweight Modular Framework for Constructing Autonomous Agents Driven by Large Language Models: Design, Implementation, and Applications in AgentForge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13383</link><description>arXiv:2601.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of LLMs has catalyzed a paradigm shift in autonomous agent development, enabling systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex multi-step tasks. However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development. AgentForge addresses a critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem by providing researchers and practitioners with a production-ready foundation for constructing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous agents without sacrificing flexibility or performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13383v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Completion to Editing: Unlocking Context-Aware Code Infilling via Search-and-Replace Instruction Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13384</link><description>arXiv:2601.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) paradigm for code completion is constrained by its rigid inability to correct contextual errors and reliance on unaligned, insecure Base models. While Chat LLMs offer safety and Agentic workflows provide flexibility, they suffer from performance degradation and prohibitive latency, respectively. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Search-and-Replace Infilling (SRI), a framework that internalizes the agentic verification-and-editing mechanism into a unified, single-pass inference process. By structurally grounding edits via an explicit search phase, SRI harmonizes completion tasks with the instruction-following priors of Chat LLMs, extending the paradigm from static infilling to dynamic context-aware editing. We synthesize a high-quality dataset, SRI-200K, and fine-tune the SRI-Coder series. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that with minimal data (20k samples), SRI-Coder enables Chat models to surpass the completion performance of their Base counterparts. Crucially, unlike FIM-style tuning, SRI preserves general coding competencies and maintains inference latency comparable to standard FIM. We empower the entire Qwen3-Coder series with SRI, encouraging the developer community to leverage this framework for advanced auto-completion and assisted development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Organ-Aware Attention Improves CT Triage and Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13385</link><description>arXiv:2601.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an urgent need for triage and classification of high-volume medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), which can improve patient care and mitigate radiologist burnout. Study-level CT triage requires calibrated predictions with localized evidence; however, off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLM) struggle with 3D anatomy, protocol shifts, and noisy report supervision. This study used the two largest publicly available chest CT datasets: CT-RATE and RADCHEST-CT (held-out external test set). Our carefully tuned supervised baseline (instantiated as a simple Global Average Pooling head) establishes a new supervised state of the art, surpassing all reported linear-probe VLMs. Building on this baseline, we present ORACLE-CT, an encoder-agnostic, organ-aware head that pairs Organ-Masked Attention (mask-restricted, per-organ pooling that yields spatial evidence) with Organ-Scalar Fusion (lightweight fusion of normalized volume and mean-HU cues). In the chest setting, ORACLE-CT masked attention model achieves AUROC 0.86 on CT-RATE; in the abdomen setting, on MERLIN (30 findings), our supervised baseline exceeds a reproduced zero-shot VLM baseline obtained by running publicly released weights through our pipeline, and adding masked attention plus scalar fusion further improves performance to AUROC 0.85. Together, these results deliver state-of-the-art supervised classification performance across both chest and abdomen CT under a unified evaluation protocol.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Transformer-based architecture for 3D radar object detection that uses a novel Transformer Decoder as the prediction head to directly regress 3D bounding boxes and class scores from radar feature representations. To bridge multi-scale radar features and the decoder, we propose Pyramid Token Fusion (PTF), a lightweight module that converts a feature pyramid into a unified, scale-aware token sequence. By formulating detection as a set prediction problem with learnable object queries and positional encodings, our design models long-range spatial-temporal correlations and cross-feature interactions. This approach eliminates dense proposal generation and heuristic post-processing such as extensive non-maximum suppression (NMS) tuning. We evaluate the proposed framework on the RADDet, where it achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art radar-only baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Confidence over Time: Confidence Calibration with Temporal Logic for Large Language Model Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13387</link><description>arXiv:2601.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-form, multi-step reasoning to solve complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving and scientific question answering. Despite strong performance, existing confidence estimation methods typically reduce an entire reasoning process to a single scalar score, ignoring how confidence evolves throughout the generation. As a result, these methods are often sensitive to superficial factors such as response length or verbosity, and struggle to distinguish correct reasoning from confidently stated errors. We propose to characterize the stepwise confidence signal using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Using a discriminative STL mining procedure, we discover temporal formulas that distinguish confidence signals of correct and incorrect responses. Our analysis found that the STL patterns generalize across tasks, and numeric parameters exhibit sensitivity to individual questions. Based on these insights, we develop a confidence estimation approach that informs STL blocks with parameter hypernetworks. Experiments on multiple reasoning tasks show our confidence scores are more calibrated than the baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13387v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structured Insight from Unstructured Data: Large Language Models for SDOH-Driven Diabetes Risk Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13388</link><description>arXiv:2601.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDOH) play a critical role in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) management but are often absent from electronic health records and risk prediction models. Most individual-level SDOH data is collected through structured screening tools, which lack the flexibility to capture the complexity of patient experiences and unique needs of a clinic's population. This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract structured SDOH information from unstructured patient life stories and evaluate the predictive value of both the extracted features and the narratives themselves for assessing diabetes control. We collected unstructured interviews from 65 T2D patients aged 65 and older, focused on their lived experiences, social context, and diabetes management. These narratives were analyzed using LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation to produce concise, actionable qualitative summaries for clinical interpretation and structured quantitative SDOH ratings for risk prediction modeling. The structured SDOH ratings were used independently and in combination with traditional laboratory biomarkers as inputs to linear and tree-based machine learning models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to demonstrate how unstructured narrative data can be applied in conventional risk prediction workflows. Finally, we evaluated several LLMs on their ability to predict a patient's level of diabetes control (low, medium, high) directly from interview text with A1C values redacted. LLMs achieved 60% accuracy in predicting diabetes control levels from interview text. This work demonstrates how LLMs can translate unstructured SDOH-related data into structured insights, offering a scalable approach to augment clinical risk models and decision-making.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13388v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robustness and Resilience Evaluation of Eco-Driving Strategies at Signalized Intersections</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13389</link><description>arXiv:2601.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eco-driving strategies have demonstrated substantial potential for improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions, especially at signalized intersections. However, evaluations of eco-driving methods typically rely on simplified simulation or experimental conditions, where certain assumptions are made to manage complexity and experimental control. This study introduces a unified framework to evaluate eco-driving strategies through the lens of two complementary criteria: control robustness and environmental resilience. We define formal indicators that quantify performance degradation caused by internal execution variability and external environmental disturbances, respectively. These indicators are then applied to assess multiple eco-driving controllers through real-world vehicle experiments. The results reveal key tradeoffs between tracking accuracy and adaptability, showing that optimization-based controllers offer more consistent performance across varying disturbance levels, while analytical controllers may perform comparably under nominal conditions but exhibit greater sensitivity to execution and timing variability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Memorization: Testing LLM Reasoning on Unseen Theory of Computation Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13392</link><description>arXiv:2601.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on formal language tasks, yet whether this reflects genuine symbolic reasoning or pattern matching on familiar constructions remains unclear. We introduce a benchmark for deterministic finite automata (DFA) construction from regular languages, comprising factual knowledge questions, seen construction problems from public sources, and two types of unseen problems: hand-crafted instances with multiple interacting constraints and systematically generated problems via Arden's theorem. Models achieve perfect accuracy on factual questions and 84-90% on seen tasks. However, accuracy drops sharply on unseen problems (by 30-64%), with failures stemming from systematic misinterpretation of language constraints, incorrect handling of Kleene-star semantics, and a failure to preserve global consistency. We evaluate a three-stage hint protocol that enables correction of shallow errors but does not reliably resolve globally inconsistent or structurally flawed automata. Our analysis across multiple prompting strategies (direct, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought) reveals that errors persist regardless of prompting approach, exposing a fundamental gap between LLMs' ability to generate syntactically plausible DFAs and their capacity for semantically correct formal reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13392v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can LLMs Compress (and Decompress)?

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate strong performance on code benchmarks, yet round-trip code execution reveals limitations in their ability to maintain consistent reasoning across forward and backward execution. We present RoundTripCodeEval (RTCE), a comprehensive benchmark consisting of four distinct code execution reasoning tasks designed to rigorously test round-trip consistency. RTCE provides an execution-free, exact-match evaluation of bijection fidelity, assessing whether models preserve a consistent one-to-one mapping between encoding and decoding operations across various algorithms and directions. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art Code-LLMs using zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on execution traces, and self-reflection mechanisms. Each yields modest improvements, but none closes the gap, indicating that current LLMs struggle with true round-trip consistency, which demonstrates that they lack the internal coherence required for trustworthy code reasoning. RTCE surfaces several new and previously unmeasured insights that are not captured by existing I/O-prediction, execution-reasoning, or round-trip natural-language benchmarks. We will release the code and the dataset upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13398v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QERS: Quantum Encryption Resilience Score for Post-Quantum Cryptography in Computer, IoT, and IIoT Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13399</link><description>arXiv:2601.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is becoming essential for securing Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems against quantum-enabled adversaries. However, existing evaluation approaches primarily focus on isolated performance metrics, offering limited support for holistic security and deployment decisions. This paper introduces QERS (Quantum Encryption Resilience Score), a universal measurement framework that integrates cryptographic performance, system constraints, and multi-criteria decision analysis to assess PQC readiness in computer, IoT, and IIoT environments. QERS combines normalized metrics, weighted aggregation, and machine learning-assisted analysis to produce interpretable resilience scores across heterogeneous devices and communication protocols. Experimental results demonstrate how the framework enables comparative evaluation of post-quantum schemes under realistic resource constraints, supporting informed security design and migration planning. This work is presented as a preprint, with extended statistical validation planned as part of ongoing graduate research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13399v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Image Prior with L0 Gradient Regularizer for Image Smoothing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13400</link><description>arXiv:2601.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image smoothing is a fundamental image processing operation that preserves the underlying structure, such as strong edges and contours, and removes minor details and textures in an image. Many image smoothing algorithms rely on computing local window statistics or solving an optimization problem. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage deep learning, but they require a carefully curated training dataset. Because constructing a proper training dataset for image smoothing is challenging, we propose DIP-$\ell_0$, a deep image prior framework that incorporates the $\ell_0$ gradient regularizer. This framework can perform high-quality image smoothing without any training data. To properly minimize the associated loss function that has the nonconvex, nonsmooth $\ell_0$ ``norm", we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that utilizes an off-the-shelf $\ell_0$ gradient minimization solver. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DIP-$\ell_0$ outperforms many image smoothing algorithms in edge-preserving image smoothing and JPEG artifact removal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13400v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning with Pixel-level Precision: QVLM Architecture and SQuID Dataset for Quantitative Geospatial Analytics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13401</link><description>arXiv:2601.13401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail at quantitative spatial reasoning because their architectures destroy pixel-level information required for counting and measurements. Vision encoders compress images through patch embeddings, reducing spatial indexing and losing the precise pixel-level tracking required for accurate counting. We present two contributions to address this fundamental limitation. First, we introduce SQuID (Satellite Quantitative Intelligence Dataset), a benchmark of 2,000 satellite image Question-Answer pairs with both numerical range and categorical answers, designed to evaluate quantitative spatial reasoning. The dataset spans three difficulty tiers with annotations automatically generated from human labels and their learned variability. Second, we propose QVLM (Quantitative Vision-Language Model), a code-generation architecture that maintains pixel precision by decoupling language understanding from visual analysis. Instead of encoding images into embeddings, QVLM generates executable code that first calls a segmentation model to obtain pixel-level masks, then operates directly on these masks, preserving spatial indexing throughout the reasoning process. Our experiments show that QVLM using GPT-5 as coder achieves 42.0% accuracy on SQuID compared to 28.1% for a VLM prompted with image-question pairs. Our work reveals that, for quantitative spatial reasoning, architectural decoupling enables better accuracy on quantitative tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13401v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Local-to-Global Logical Explanations for Deep Vision Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13404</link><description>arXiv:2601.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep neural networks are extremely effective at classifying images, they remain opaque and hard to interpret. We introduce local and global explanation methods for black-box models that generate explanations in terms of human-recognizable primitive concepts. Both the local explanations for a single image and the global explanations for a set of images are cast as logical formulas in monotone disjunctive-normal-form (MDNF), whose satisfaction guarantees that the model yields a high score on a given class. We also present an algorithm for explaining the classification of examples into multiple classes in the form of a monotone explanation list over primitive concepts. Despite their simplicity and interpretability we show that the explanations maintain high fidelity and coverage with respect to the blackbox models they seek to explain in challenging vision datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13404v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Integrating Virtual Reality and Large Language Models for Team-Based Non-Technical Skills Training and Evaluation in the Operating Room</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13406</link><description>arXiv:2601.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although effective teamwork and communication are critical to surgical safety, structured training for non-technical skills (NTS) remains limited compared with technical simulation. The ACS/APDS Phase III Team-Based Skills Curriculum calls for scalable tools that both teach and objectively assess these competencies during laparoscopic emergencies. We introduce the Virtual Operating Room Team Experience (VORTeX), a multi-user virtual reality (VR) platform that integrates immersive team simulation with large language model (LLM) analytics to train and evaluate communication, decision-making, teamwork, and leadership. Team dialogue is analyzed using structured prompts derived from the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) framework, enabling automated classification of behaviors and generation of directed interaction graphs that quantify communication structure and hierarchy. Two laparoscopic emergency scenarios, pneumothorax and intra-abdominal bleeding, were implemented to elicit realistic stress and collaboration. Twelve surgical professionals completed pilot sessions at the 2024 SAGES conference, rating VORTeX as intuitive, immersive, and valuable for developing teamwork and communication. The LLM consistently produced interpretable communication networks reflecting expected operative hierarchies, with surgeons as central integrators, nurses as initiators, and anesthesiologists as balanced intermediaries. By integrating immersive VR with LLM-driven behavioral analytics, VORTeX provides a scalable, privacy-compliant framework for objective assessment and automated, data-informed debriefing across distributed training environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13406v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Classifiers in High Dimensional Hilbert Metrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13410</link><description>arXiv:2601.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying points in high dimensional spaces is a fundamental geometric problem in machine learning. In this paper, we address classifying points in the $d$-dimensional Hilbert polygonal metric. The Hilbert metric is a generalization of the Cayley-Klein hyperbolic distance to arbitrary convex bodies and has a diverse range of applications in machine learning and convex geometry. We first present an efficient LP-based algorithm in the metric for the large-margin SVM problem. Our algorithm runs in time polynomial to the number of points, bounding facets, and dimension. This is a significant improvement on previous works, which either provide no theoretical guarantees on running time, or suffer from exponential runtime. We also consider the closely related Funk metric. We also present efficient algorithms for the soft-margin SVM problem and for nearest neighbor-based classification in the Hilbert metric.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13410v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Using deep learning for predicting cleansing quality of colon capsule endoscopy images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13412</link><description>arXiv:2601.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of deep learning techniques for predicting cleansing quality in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images. Using a dataset of 500 images labeled by 14 clinicians on the Leighton-Rex scale (Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent), a ResNet-18 model was trained for classification, leveraging stratified K-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance. To optimize the model, structured pruning techniques were applied iteratively, achieving significant sparsity while maintaining high accuracy. Explainability of the pruned model was evaluated using Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Eigen-CAM, Ablation-CAM, and Random-CAM, with the ROAD method employed for consistent evaluation. Our results indicate that for a pruned model, we can achieve a cross-validation accuracy of 88% with 79% sparsity, demonstrating the effectiveness of pruning in improving efficiency from 84% without compromising performance. We also highlight the challenges of evaluating cleansing quality of CCE images, emphasize the importance of explainability in clinical applications, and discuss the challenges associated with using the ROAD method for our task. Finally, we employ a variant of adaptive temperature scaling to calibrate the pruned models for an external dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13412v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion Representations for Fine-Grained Image Classification: A Marine Plankton Case Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13416</link><description>arXiv:2601.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative methods for image synthesis, yet their potential as general-purpose feature encoders remains underexplored. Trained for denoising and generation without labels, they can be interpreted as self-supervised learners that capture both low- and high-level structure. We show that a frozen diffusion backbone enables strong fine-grained recognition by probing intermediate denoising features across layers and timesteps and training a linear classifier for each pair. We evaluate this in a real-world plankton-monitoring setting with practical impact, using controlled and comparable training setups against established supervised and self-supervised baselines. Frozen diffusion features are competitive with supervised baselines and outperform other self-supervised methods in both balanced and naturally long-tailed settings. Out-of-distribution evaluations on temporally and geographically shifted plankton datasets further show that frozen diffusion features maintain strong accuracy and Macro F1 under substantial distribution shift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13416v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SGW-GAN: Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein Guided GANs for Retinal Fundus Image Enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13417</link><description>arXiv:2601.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retinal fundus photography is indispensable for ophthalmic screening and diagnosis, yet image quality is often degraded by noise, artifacts, and uneven illumination. Recent GAN- and diffusion-based enhancement methods improve perceptual quality by aligning degraded images with high-quality distributions, but our analysis shows that this focus can distort intra-class geometry: clinically related samples become dispersed, disease-class boundaries blur, and downstream tasks such as grading or lesion detection are harmed. The Gromov Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy offers a principled solution by aligning distributions through internal pairwise distances, naturally preserving intra-class structure, but its high computational cost restricts practical use. To overcome this, we propose SGW-GAN, the first framework to incorporate Sliced GW (SGW) into retinal image enhancement. SGW approximates GW via random projections, retaining relational fidelity while greatly reducing cost. Experiments on public datasets show that SGW-GAN produces visually compelling enhancements, achieves superior diabetic retinopathy grading, and reports the lowest GW discrepancy across disease labels, demonstrating both efficiency and clinical fidelity for unpaired medical image enhancement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13417v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TrustEnergy: A Unified Framework for Accurate and Reliable User-level Energy Usage Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13422</link><description>arXiv:2601.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy usage prediction is important for various real-world applications, including grid management, infrastructure planning, and disaster response. Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13422v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Encryption Resilience Score (QERS) for MQTT, HTTP, and HTTPS under Post-Quantum Cryptography in Computer, IoT, and IIoT Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13423</link><description>arXiv:2601.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) introduces significant computational and communication overhead, which poses challenges for resource-constrained computer systems, Internet of Things (IoT), and Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the Quantum Encryption Resilience Score (QERS) applied to MQTT, HTTP, and HTTPS communication protocols operating under PQC. Using an ESP32-C6 client and an ARM-based Raspberry Pi CM4 server, latency, CPU utilization, RSSI, energy consumption, key size, and TLS handshake overhead are measured under realistic operating conditions. QERS integrates these heterogeneous metrics into normalized Basic, Tuned, and Fusion scores, enabling systematic comparison of protocol efficiency and security resilience. Experimental results show that MQTT provides the highest efficiency under PQC constraints, while HTTPS achieves the highest security-weighted resilience at the cost of increased latency and resource consumption. The proposed framework supports informed protocol selection and migration planning for PQC-enabled IoT and IIoT deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13423v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Driving Computational Efficiency in Large-Scale Platforms using HPC Technologies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13424</link><description>arXiv:2601.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) project utilizes extensive High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources for complex astroparticle physics simulations, making resource efficiency critical for scientific productivity and sustainability. This article presents a detailed analysis focused on quantifying and improving HPC resource utilization efficiency specifically within the LAGO computational environment. The core objective is to understand how LAGO's distinct computational workloads-characterized by a prevalent coarse-grained, task-parallel execution model-consume resources in practice. To achieve this, we analyze historical job accounting data from the EGI FedCloud platform, identifying primary workload categories (Monte Carlo simulations, data processing, user analysis/testing) and evaluating their performance using key efficiency metrics (CPU utilization, walltime utilization, and I/O patterns). Our analysis reveals significant patterns, including high CPU efficiency within individual simulation tasks contrasted with the distorting impact of short test jobs on aggregate metrics. This work pinpoints specific inefficiencies and provides data-driven insights into LAGO's HPC usage. The findings directly inform recommendations for optimizing resource requests, refining workflow management strategies, and guiding future efforts to enhance computational throughput, ultimately maximizing the scientific return from LAGO's HPC investments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Scientific Data Integrity system based on Blockchain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13425</link><description>arXiv:2601.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most High Performance Computing (HPC) projects nowadays, there is a lot of data obtained from different sources, depending on the project's objectives. Some of that data is very huge in terms of size, so copying such data sometimes is an unrealistic goal. On the other hand, science requires data used for different purposes to remain unaltered, so different groups of researchers can reproduce results, discuss theories, and validate each other. In this paper, we present a novel approach to help research groups to validate data integrity on such distributed repositories using Blockchain. Originally developed for cryptographic currencies, Blockchain has demonstrated a versatile range of uses. Our proposal ensures 1) secure access to data management, 2) easy validation of data integrity, and 3) an easy way to add new records to the dataset with the same robust integrity policy. A prototype was developed and tested using a subset of a public dataset from a real scientific collaboration, the Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) Project.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13425v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Techniques of Modern Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13427</link><description>arXiv:2601.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The techniques used in modern attacks have become an important factor for investigation. As we advance further into the digital age, cyber attackers are employing increasingly sophisticated and highly threatening methods. These attacks target not only organizations and governments but also extend to private and corporate sectors. Modern attack techniques, such as lateral movement and ransomware, are designed to infiltrate networks and steal sensitive data. Among these techniques, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a complex method of attack aimed at specific targets to steal high-value sensitive information or damage the infrastructure of the targeted organization. In this paper, I will investigate Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) as a modern attack technique, focusing on both the attack life cycle and cutting-edge detection and defense strategies proposed in recent academic research. I will analyze four representative papers to understand the evolution of APT detection mechanisms, including machine learning-driven behavioral analysis and network-level collaborative defense models. Through this comparative analysis, I aim to highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach and propose more adaptive APT mitigation strategies. The study seeks to analyze the key characteristics of APTs and provide a comprehensive high-level understanding of APTs along with potential solutions to the threats they pose.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trust Me, I'm an Expert: Decoding and Steering Authority Bias in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13433</link><description>arXiv:2601.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research demonstrates that performance of language models on reasoning tasks can be influenced by suggestions, hints and endorsements. However, the influence of endorsement source credibility remains underexplored. We investigate whether language models exhibit systematic bias based on the perceived expertise of the provider of the endorsement. Across 4 datasets spanning mathematical, legal, and medical reasoning, we evaluate 11 models using personas representing four expertise levels per domain. Our results reveal that models are increasingly susceptible to incorrect/misleading endorsements as source expertise increases, with higher-authority sources inducing not only accuracy degradation but also increased confidence in wrong answers. We also show that this authority bias is mechanistically encoded within the model and a model can be steered away from the bias, thereby improving its performance even when an expert gives a misleading endorsement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Learnable Wavelet Transformer for Long-Short Equity Trading and Risk-Adjusted Return Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13435</link><description>arXiv:2601.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning profitable intraday trading policies from financial time series is challenging due to heavy noise, non-stationarity, and strong cross-sectional dependence among related assets. We propose \emph{WaveLSFormer}, a learnable wavelet-based long-short Transformer that jointly performs multi-scale decomposition and return-oriented decision learning. Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13435v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MOSLD-Bench: Multilingual Open-Set Learning and Discovery Benchmark for Text Categorization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13437</link><description>arXiv:2601.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set learning and discovery (OSLD) is a challenging machine learning task in which samples from new (unknown) classes can appear at test time. It can be seen as a generalization of zero-shot learning, where the new classes are not known a priori, hence involving the active discovery of new classes. While zero-shot learning has been extensively studied in text classification, especially with the emergence of pre-trained language models, open-set learning and discovery is a comparatively new setup for the text domain. To this end, we introduce the first multilingual open-set learning and discovery (MOSLD) benchmark for text categorization by topic, comprising 960K data samples across 12 languages. To construct the benchmark, we (i) rearrange existing datasets and (ii) collect new data samples from the news domain. Moreover, we propose a novel framework for the OSLD task, which integrates multiple stages to continuously discover and learn new classes. We evaluate several language models, including our own, to obtain results that can be used as reference for future work. We release our benchmark at https://github.com/Adriana19Valentina/MOSLD-Bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13437v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analyzing VLM-Based Approaches for Anomaly Classification and Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13440</link><description>arXiv:2601.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly CLIP, have revolutionized anomaly detection by enabling zero-shot and few-shot defect identification without extensive labeled datasets. By learning aligned representations of images and text, VLMs facilitate anomaly classification and segmentation through natural language descriptions of normal and abnormal states, eliminating traditional requirements for task-specific training or defect examples. This project presents a comprehensive analysis of VLM-based approaches for anomaly classification (AC) and anomaly segmentation (AS). We systematically investigate key architectural paradigms including sliding window-based dense feature extraction (WinCLIP), multi-stage feature alignment with learnable projections (AprilLab framework), and compositional prompt ensemble strategies. Our analysis evaluates these methods across critical dimensions: feature extraction mechanisms, text-visual alignment strategies, prompt engineering techniques, zero-shot versus few-shot trade-offs, computational efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Through rigorous experimentation on benchmarks such as MVTec AD and VisA, we compare classification accuracy, segmentation precision, and inference efficiency. The primary contribution is a foundational understanding of how and why VLMs succeed in anomaly detection, synthesizing practical insights for method selection and identifying current limitations. This work aims to facilitate informed adoption of VLM-based methods in industrial quality control and guide future research directions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explicit Cognitive Allocation: A Principle for Governed and Auditable Inference in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13443</link><description>arXiv:2601.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new forms of AI-assisted reasoning across scientific, technical, and organizational domains. However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.
  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.
  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13443v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BladeSDF : Unconditional and Conditional Generative Modeling of Representative Blade Geometries Using Signed Distance Functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13445</link><description>arXiv:2601.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI has emerged as a transformative paradigm in engineering design, enabling automated synthesis and reconstruction of complex 3D geometries while preserving feasibility and performance relevance. This paper introduces a domain-specific implicit generative framework for turbine blade geometry using DeepSDF, addressing critical gaps in performance-aware modeling and manufacturable design generation. The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling. In addition, a compact neural network maps engineering descriptors, such as maximum directional strains, to latent codes, facilitating the generation of performance-informed geometry. The framework achieves high reconstruction fidelity, with surface distance errors concentrated within $1\%$ of the maximum blade dimension, and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen designs. By integrating constraints, objectives, and performance metrics, this approach advances beyond traditional 2D-guided or unconstrained 3D pipelines, offering a practical and interpretable solution for data-driven turbine blade modeling and concept generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Event-based Heterogeneous Information Processing for Online Vision-based Obstacle Detection and Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13451</link><description>arXiv:2601.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for robotic vision-based navigation that integrates Hybrid Neural Networks (HNNs) with Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based filtering to enhance situational awareness for unmodeled obstacle detection and localization. By leveraging the complementary strengths of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and SNNs, the system achieves both accurate environmental understanding and fast, energy-efficient processing. The proposed architecture employs a dual-pathway approach: an ANN component processes static spatial features at low frequency, while an SNN component handles dynamic, event-based sensor data in real time. Unlike conventional hybrid architectures that rely on domain conversion mechanisms, our system incorporates a pre-developed SNN-based filter that directly utilizes spike-encoded inputs for localization and state estimation. Detected anomalies are validated using contextual information from the ANN pathway and continuously tracked to support anticipatory navigation strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers acceptable detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency close to SNN-only implementations, which operate at a fraction of the resource cost. This framework represents a significant advancement in neuromorphic navigation systems for robots operating in unpredictable and dynamic environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13451v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PhysicsSolutionAgent: Towards Multimodal Explanations for Numerical Physics Problem Solving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13453</link><description>arXiv:2601.13453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining numerical physics problems often requires more than text-based solutions; clear visual reasoning can substantially improve conceptual understanding. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on many physics questions in textual form, their ability to generate long, high-quality visual explanations remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we introduce PhysicsSolutionAgent (PSA), an autonomous agent that generates physics-problem explanation videos of up to six minutes using Manim animations. To evaluate the generated videos, we design an assessment pipeline that performs automated checks across 15 quantitative parameters and incorporates feedback from a vision-language model (VLM) to iteratively improve video quality. We evaluate PSA on 32 videos spanning numerical and theoretical physics problems. Our results reveal systematic differences in video quality depending on problem difficulty and whether the task is numerical or theoretical. Using GPT-5-mini, PSA achieves a 100% video-completion rate with an average automated score of 3.8/5. However, qualitative analysis and human inspection uncover both minor and major issues, including visual layout inconsistencies and errors in how visual content is interpreted during feedback. These findings expose key limitations in reliable Manim code generation and highlight broader challenges in multimodal reasoning and evaluation for visual explanations of numerical physics problems. Our work underscores the need for improved visual understanding, verification, and evaluation frameworks in future multimodal educational systems</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13453v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Learning Under Temporal Drift -- Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting via Experience Replay</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13456</link><description>arXiv:2601.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning struggles under temporal concept drift where client data distributions shift over time. We demonstrate that standard FedAvg suffers catastrophic forgetting under seasonal drift on Fashion-MNIST, with accuracy dropping from 74% to 28%. We propose client-side experience replay, where each client maintains a small buffer of past samples mixed with current data during local training. This simple approach requires no changes to server aggregation. Experiments show that a 50-sample-per-class buffer restores performance to 78-82%, effectively preventing forgetting. Our ablation study reveals a clear memory-accuracy trade-off as buffer size increases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13456v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Tool for Automatically Cataloguing and Selecting Pre-Trained Models and Datasets for Software Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13460</link><description>arXiv:2601.13460v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Evaluating whether text-to-image models follow explicit spatial instructions is difficult to automate. Object detectors may miss targets or return multiple plausible detections, and simple geometric tests can become ambiguous in borderline cases. Spatial evaluation is naturally a selective prediction problem, the checker may abstain when evidence is weak and report confidence so that results can be interpreted as a risk coverage tradeoff rather than a single score. We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models. We also include a lightweight human audit used to calibrate the checker's abstention margin and confidence threshold. We evaluate three baselines, Stable Diffusion 1.5, SD 1.5 BoxDiff, and SD 1.4 GLIGEN. The checker reports pass rate and coverage as well as conditional pass rates on decided samples. The results show that grounding methods substantially improve both pass rate and coverage, while abstention remains a dominant factor due mainly to missing detections.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13462v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Qualifiers for Neural Network Model Selection in Hadronic Physics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13463</link><description>arXiv:2601.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum machine-learning architectures mature, a central challenge is no longer their construction, but identifying the regimes in which they offer practical advantages over classical approaches. In this work, we introduce a framework for addressing this question in data-driven hadronic physics problems by developing diagnostic tools - centered on a quantitative quantum qualifier - that guide model selection between classical and quantum deep neural networks based on intrinsic properties of the data. Using controlled classification and regression studies, we show how relative model performance follows systematic trends in complexity, noise, and dimensionality, and how these trends can be distilled into a predictive criterion. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach through an application to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the quantum qualifier identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models. Together, these results establish a principled framework for deploying quantum machine-learning tools in precision hadronic physics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13463v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context and Transcripts Improve Detection of Deepfake Audios of Public Figures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13464</link><description>arXiv:2601.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans use context to assess the veracity of information. However, current audio deepfake detectors only analyze the audio file without considering either context or transcripts. We create and analyze a Journalist-provided Deepfake Dataset (JDD) of 255 public deepfakes which were primarily contributed by over 70 journalists since early 2024. We also generate a synthetic audio dataset (SYN) of dead public figures and propose a novel Context-based Audio Deepfake Detector (CADD) architecture. In addition, we evaluate performance on two large-scale datasets: ITW and P$^2$V. We show that sufficient context and/or the transcript can significantly improve the efficacy of audio deepfake detectors. Performance (measured via F1 score, AUC, and EER) of multiple baseline audio deepfake detectors and traditional classifiers can be improved by 5%-37.58% in F1-score, 3.77%-42.79% in AUC, and 6.17%-47.83% in EER. We additionally show that CADD, via its use of context and/or transcripts, is more robust to 5 adversarial evasion strategies, limiting performance degradation to an average of just -0.71% across all experiments.

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single training trajectory can transform a graph neural network into an unsupervised heuristic for combinatorial optimization. Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13465v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Governance Matters: Lessons from Restructuring the data.table OSS Project</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13466</link><description>arXiv:2601.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open source software (OSS) forms the backbone of industrial data workflows and enterprise systems. However, many OSS projects face operational risks due to informal or centralized governance. This paper presents a practical case study of data.table, a high-performance R package widely adopted in production analytics pipelines, which underwent a community-led governance reform to address scalability and sustainability concerns. Before the reform, data.table faced a growing backlog of unresolved issues and open pull requests, unclear contributor pathways, and bottlenecks caused by reliance on a single core maintainer. In response, the community initiated a redesign of its governance structure. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of this transition through a mixed-methods approach, combining a contributor survey (n=17) with mining project repository data. Our results show that following the reform, the project experienced a 200% increase in new contributor recruitment, a drop in pull request resolution time from over 700 days to under a week, and a 3x increase in contributor retention. Community sentiment improved around transparency, onboarding, and project momentum, though concerns around fairness and conflict resolution remain. This case study provides practical guidance for maintainers, companies, and foundations seeking to enhance OSS governance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13466v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Preconditioning Benefits of Spectral Orthogonalization in Muon</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13474</link><description>arXiv:2601.13474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer, a matrix-structured algorithm that leverages spectral orthogonalization of gradients, is a milestone in the pretraining of large language models. However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13474v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Variational Imputation Framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Data Using Retrieval-Augmented Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13476</link><description>arXiv:2601.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of data-driven applications in electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, such as charging demand forecasting, hinges on the availability of complete, high-quality charging data. However, real-world EV datasets are often plagued by missing records, and existing imputation methods are ill-equipped for the complex, multimodal context of charging data, often relying on a restrictive one-model-per-station paradigm that ignores valuable inter-station correlations. To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that PRAIM significantly outperforms established baselines in both imputation accuracy and its ability to preserve the original data's statistical distribution, leading to substantial improvements in downstream forecasting performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13476v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Learners' Expectations and Engagement When Collaborating with Constructively Controversial Peer Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13479</link><description>arXiv:2601.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer agents can supplement real-time collaborative learning in asynchronous online courses. Constructive Controversy (CC) theory suggests that humans deepen their understanding of a topic by confronting and resolving controversies. This study explores whether CC's benefits apply to LLM-based peer agents, focusing on the impact of agents' disputatious behaviors and disclosure of agents' behavior designs on the learning process. In our mixed-method study (n=144), we compare LLMs that follow detailed CC guidelines (regulated) to those guided by broader goals (unregulated) and examine the effects of disclosing the agents' design to users (transparent vs. opaque). Findings show that learners' values influence their agent interaction: those valuing control appreciate unregulated agents' willingness to cease push-back upon request, while those valuing intellectual challenges favor regulated agents for stimulating creativity. Additionally, design transparency lowers learners' perception of agents' abilities. Our findings lay the foundation for designing effective collaborative peer agents in isolated educational settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Efficient and Robust Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis for Mental Health via Multi-Agent Instruction Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13481</link><description>arXiv:2601.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linguistic expressions of emotions such as depression, anxiety, and trauma-related states are pervasive in clinical notes, counseling dialogues, and online mental health communities, and accurate recognition of these emotions is essential for clinical triage, risk assessment, and timely intervention. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation. Experimental results show that APOLO consistently improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and generalizable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13481v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spectrum &amp; RAN Sharing: A Measurement-based Case Study of Commercial 5G Networks in Spain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13484</link><description>arXiv:2601.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) sharing, which often also includes spectrum sharing, is a strategic cooperative agreement among two or more mobile operators, where one operator may use another's RAN infrastructure to provide mobile services to its users. By mutually sharing physical sites, radio elements, licensed spectrum and other parts of the RAN infrastructure, participating operators can significantly reduce the capital (and operational) expenditure in deploying and operating cellular networks, while accelerating coverage expansion -- thereby addressing the spectrum scarcity and infrastructure cost challenges in the 5G era and beyond. While the economic benefits of RAN sharing are well understood, the impact of such resource pooling on user-perceived performance remains underexplored, especially in real-world commercial deployments. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical measurement study of commercial 5G spectrum and RAN sharing. Our measurement study is unique in that, beyond identifying real-world instances of shared 5G spectrum and RAN deployment "in the wild", we also analyze users' perceived performance and its implication on Quality of Experience (QoE). Our study provides critical insights into resource management (i.e., pooling) and spectrum efficiency, offering a blueprint (and implications) for network evolution in 5G, 6G and beyond.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13484v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Hidden Toll of Social Media News: Causal Effects on Psychosocial Wellbeing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13487</link><description>arXiv:2601.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News consumption on social media has become ubiquitous, yet how different forms of engagement shape psychosocial outcomes remains unclear. To address this gap, we leveraged a large-scale dataset of ~26M posts and ~45M comments on the BlueSky platform, and conducted a quasi-experimental study, matching 81,345 Treated users exposed to News feeds with 83,711 Control users using stratified propensity score analysis. We examined psychosocial wellbeing, in terms of affective, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that news engagement produces systematic trade-offs: increased depression, stress, and anxiety, yet decreased loneliness and increased social interaction on the platform. Regression models reveal that News feed bookmarking is associated with greater psychosocial deterioration compared to commenting or quoting, with magnitude differences exceeding tenfold. These per-engagement effects accumulate with repeated exposure, showing significant psychosocial impacts. Our work extends theories of news effects beyond crisis-centric frameworks by demonstrating that routine consumption creates distinct psychological dynamics depending on engagement type, and bears implications for tools and interventions for mitigating the psychosocial costs of news consumption on social media.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13487v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging the Gap Between Estimated and True Regret Towards Reliable Regret Estimation in Deep Learning based Mechanism Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13489</link><description>arXiv:2601.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances, such as RegretNet, ALGnet, RegretFormer and CITransNet, use deep learning to approximate optimal multi item auctions by relaxing incentive compatibility (IC) and measuring its violation via ex post regret. However, the true accuracy of these regret estimates remains unclear. Computing exact regret is computationally intractable, and current models rely on gradient based optimizers whose outcomes depend heavily on hyperparameter choices. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing methods systematically underestimate actual regret (In some models, the true regret is several hundred times larger than the reported regret), leading to overstated claims of IC and revenue. To address this issue, we derive a lower bound on regret and introduce an efficient item wise regret approximation. Building on this, we propose a guided refinement procedure that substantially improves regret estimation accuracy while reducing computational cost. Our method provides a more reliable foundation for evaluating incentive compatibility in deep learning based auction mechanisms and highlights the need to reassess prior performance claims in this area.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13489v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning-Augmented Online TRP on a Line</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13494</link><description>arXiv:2601.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the online traveling repairperson problem on a line within the recently proposed learning-augmented framework, which provides predictions on the requests to be served via machine learning. In the original model (with no predictions), there is a stream of requests released over time along the line. The goal is to minimize the sum (or average) of the completion times of the requests. In the original model, the state-of-the-art competitive ratio lower bound is $1+\sqrt{2} &gt; 2.414$ for any deterministic algorithm and the state-of-the-art competitive ratio upper bound is 4 for a deterministic algorithm. Our prediction model involves predicted positions, possibly error-prone, of each request in the stream known a priori but the arrival times of requests are not known until their arrival. We first establish a 3-competitive lower bound which extends to the original model. We then design a deterministic algorithm that is $(2+\sqrt{3})\approx 3.732$-competitive when predictions are perfect. With imperfect predictions (maximum error $\delta &gt; 0$), we show that our deterministic algorithm becomes $\min\{3.732+4\delta,4\}$-competitive, knowing $\delta$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for online traveling repairperson problem in the learning-augmented framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13494v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optical Linear Systems Framework for Event Sensing and Computational Neuromorphic Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13498</link><description>arXiv:2601.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event vision sensors (neuromorphic cameras) output sparse, asynchronous ON/OFF events triggered by log-intensity threshold crossings, enabling microsecond-scale sensing with high dynamic range and low data bandwidth. As a nonlinear system, this event representation does not readily integrate with the linear forward models that underpin most computational imaging and optical system design. We present a physics-grounded processing pipeline that maps event streams to estimates of per-pixel log-intensity and intensity derivatives, and embeds these measurements in a dynamic linear systems model with a time-varying point spread function. This enables inverse filtering directly from event data, using frequency-domain Wiener deconvolution with a known (or parameterised) dynamic transfer function. We validate the approach in simulation for single and overlapping point sources under modulated defocus, and on real event data from a tunable-focus telescope imaging a star field, demonstrating source localisation and separability. The proposed framework provides a practical bridge between event sensing and model-based computational imaging for dynamic optical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13498v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Concurrent Permissive Strategy Templates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13500</link><description>arXiv:2601.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-player games on finite graphs provide a rigorous foundation for modeling the strategic interaction between reactive systems and their environment. While concurrent game semantics naturally capture the synchronous interactions characteristic of many cyber-physical systems (CPS), their adoption in CPS design remains limited. Building on the concept of permissive strategy templates (PeSTels) for turn-based games, we introduce concurrent (permissive) strategy templates (ConSTels) -- a novel representation for sets of randomized winning strategies in concurrent games with Safety, B\"uchi, and Co-B\"uchi objectives. ConSTels compactly encode infinite families of strategies, thereby supporting both offline and online adaptation. Offline, we exploit compositionality to enable incremental synthesis: combining ConSTels for simpler objectives into non-conflicting templates for more complex combined objectives. Online, we demonstrate how ConSTels facilitate runtime adaptation, adjusting action probabilities in response to observed opponent behavior to optimize performance while preserving correctness. We implemented ConSTel synthesis and adaptation in a prototype tool and experimentally show its potential.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DIS2: Disentanglement Meets Distillation with Classwise Attention for Robust Remote Sensing Segmentation under Missing Modalities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13502</link><description>arXiv:2601.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficacy of multimodal learning in remote sensing (RS) is severely undermined by missing modalities. The challenge is exacerbated by the RS highly heterogeneous data and huge scale variation. Consequently, paradigms proven effective in other domains often fail when confronted with these unique data characteristics. Conventional disentanglement learning, which relies on significant feature overlap between modalities (modality-invariant), is insufficient for this heterogeneity. Similarly, knowledge distillation becomes an ill-posed mimicry task where a student fails to focus on the necessary compensatory knowledge, leaving the semantic gap unaddressed. Our work is therefore built upon three pillars uniquely designed for RS: (1) principled missing information compensation, (2) class-specific modality contribution, and (3) multi-resolution feature importance. We propose a novel method DIS2, a new paradigm shifting from modality-shared feature dependence and untargeted imitation to active, guided missing features compensation. Its core novelty lies in a reformulated synergy between disentanglement learning and knowledge distillation, termed DLKD. Compensatory features are explicitly captured which, when fused with the features of the available modality, approximate the ideal fused representation of the full-modality case. To address the class-specific challenge, our Classwise Feature Learning Module (CFLM) adaptively learn discriminative evidence for each target depending on signal availability. Both DLKD and CFLM are supported by a hierarchical hybrid fusion (HF) structure using features across resolutions to strengthen prediction. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13502v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anonpsy: A Graph-Based Framework for Structure-Preserving De-identification of Psychiatric Narratives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13503</link><description>arXiv:2601.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychiatric narratives encode patient identity not only through explicit identifiers but also through idiosyncratic life events embedded in their clinical structure. Existing de-identification approaches, including PHI masking and LLM-based synthetic rewriting, operate at the text level and offer limited control over which semantic elements are preserved or altered. We introduce Anonpsy, a de-identification framework that reformulates the task as graph-guided semantic rewriting. Anonpsy (1) converts each narrative into a semantic graph encoding clinical entities, temporal anchors, and typed relations; (2) applies graph-constrained perturbations that modify identifying context while preserving clinically essential structure; and (3) regenerates text via graph-conditioned LLM generation. Evaluated on 90 clinician-authored psychiatric case narratives, Anonpsy preserves diagnostic fidelity while achieving consistently low re-identification risk under expert, semantic, and GPT-5-based evaluations. Compared with a strong LLM-only rewriting baseline, Anonpsy yields substantially lower semantic similarity and identifiability. These results demonstrate that explicit structural representations combined with constrained generation provide an effective approach to de-identification for psychiatric narratives.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13503v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Integrating Vision-Centric Text Understanding for Conversational Recommender Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13505</link><description>arXiv:2601.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have attracted growing attention for their ability to deliver personalized recommendations through natural language interactions. To more accurately infer user preferences from multi-turn conversations, recent works increasingly expand conversational context (e.g., by incorporating diverse entity information or retrieving related dialogues). While such context enrichment can assist preference modeling, it also introduces longer and more heterogeneous inputs, leading to practical issues such as input length constraints, text style inconsistency, and irrelevant textual noise, thereby raising the demand for stronger language understanding ability. In this paper, we propose STARCRS, a Screen-Text-AwaRe Conversational Recommender System that integrates two complementary text understanding modes: (1) a screen-reading pathway that encodes auxiliary textual information as visual tokens, mimicking skim reading on a screen, and (2) an LLM-based textual pathway that focuses on a limited set of critical content for fine-grained reasoning. We design a knowledge-anchored fusion framework that combines contrastive alignment, cross-attention interaction, and adaptive gating to integrate the two modes for improved preference modeling and response generation. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that STARCRS consistently improves both recommendation accuracy and generated response quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Group Relative Policy Optimization for Robust Blind Interference Alignment with Fluid Antennas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13506</link><description>arXiv:2601.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) leverages dynamic reconfigurability to unlock spatial degrees of freedom and reshape wireless channels. This paper proposes, for the first time, a robust fluid antenna-driven blind interference alignment (BIA) framework for a K-user MISO downlink under imperfect channel state information (CSI). We formulate a robust sum-rate maximization problem through optimizing fluid antenna positions. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we employ group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm that eliminates the critic network. This robust design reduces model size and floating point operations (FLOPs) by nearly half compared to proximal policy optimization (PPO) while significantly enhancing performance through group-based exploration that escapes bad local optima. Simulation results demonstrate that GRPO outperforms PPO by 4.17%, and a 100K-step pre-trained PPO by 30.29%. Due to error distribution learning, GRPO exceeds heuristic MaximumGain and RandomGain by 200.78% and 465.38%, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13506v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Event Classification by Physics-informed Inpainting for Distributed Multichannel Acoustic Sensor with Partially Degraded Channels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13513</link><description>arXiv:2601.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multichannel acoustic sensing (DMAS) enables large-scale sound event classification (SEC), but performance drops when many channels are degraded and when sensor layouts at test time differ from training layouts. We propose a learning-free, physics-informed inpainting frontend based on reverse time migration (RTM). In this approach, observed multichannel spectrograms are first back-propagated on a 3D grid using an analytic Green's function to form a scene-consistent image, and then forward-projected to reconstruct inpainted signals before log-mel feature extraction and Transformer-based classification. We evaluate the method on ESC-50 with 50 sensors and three layouts (circular, linear, right-angle), where per-channel SNRs are sampled from -30 to 0 dB. Compared with an AST baseline, scaling-sparsemax channel selection, and channel-swap augmentation, the proposed RTM frontend achieves the best or competitive accuracy across all layouts, improving accuracy by 13.1 points on the right-angle layout (from 9.7% to 22.8%). Correlation analyses show that spatial weights align more strongly with SNR than with channel--source distance, and that higher SNR--weight correlation corresponds to higher SEC accuracy. These results demonstrate that a reconstruct-then-project, physics-based preprocessing effectively complements learning-only methods for DMAS under layout-open configurations and severe channel degradation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13513v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgenticRed: Optimizing Agentic Systems for Automated Red-teaming</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13518</link><description>arXiv:2601.13518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent automated red-teaming methods show promise for systematically exposing model vulnerabilities, most existing approaches rely on human-specified workflows. This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement). This work highlights automated system design as a powerful paradigm for AI safety evaluation that can keep pace with rapidly evolving models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13518v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sticky Help, Bounded Effects: Session-by-Session Analytics of Teacher Interventions in K-12 Classrooms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13520</link><description>arXiv:2601.13520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teachers' in-the-moment support is a limited resource in technology-supported classrooms, and teachers must decide whom to help and when during ongoing student work. However, less is known about how students' prior help history (whether they were helped earlier) and their engagement states (e.g., idle, struggle) shape teachers' decisions, and whether observed learning benefits associated with teacher help extend beyond the current class session. To address these questions, we first conducted interviews with nine K-12 mathematics teachers to identify candidate decision factors for teacher help. We then analyzed 1.4 million student-system interactions from 339 students across 14 classes in the MATHia intelligent tutoring system by linking teacher-logged help events with fine-grained engagement states. Mixed-effects models show that students who received help earlier were more likely to receive additional help later, even after accounting for current engagement state. Cross-lagged panel analyses further show that teacher help recurred across sessions, whereas idle behavior did not receive sustained attention over time. Finally, help coincided with immediate learning within sessions, but did not predict skill acquisition in later sessions, as estimated by additive factor modeling. These findings suggest that teacher help is "sticky" in that it recurs for previously supported students, while its measurable learning benefits in our data are largely session-bound. We discuss implications for designing real-time analytics that track attention coverage and highlight under-visited students to support a more equitable and effective allocation of teacher attention.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13520v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GO-MLVTON: Garment Occlusion-Aware Multi-Layer Virtual Try-On with Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13524</link><description>arXiv:2601.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) methods primarily focus on single-layer or multi-garment VTON, neglecting multi-layer VTON (ML-VTON), which involves dressing multiple layers of garments onto the human body with realistic deformation and layering to generate visually plausible outcomes. The main challenge lies in accurately modeling occlusion relationships between inner and outer garments to reduce interference from redundant inner garment features. To address this, we propose GO-MLVTON, the first multi-layer VTON method, introducing the Garment Occlusion Learning module to learn occlusion relationships and the StableDiffusion-based Garment Morphing &amp; Fitting module to deform and fit garments onto the human body, producing high-quality multi-layer try-on results. Additionally, we present the MLG dataset for this task and propose a new metric named Layered Appearance Coherence Difference (LACD) for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GO-MLVTON.

Abstract: Dense retrievers powered by pretrained embeddings are widely used for document retrieval but struggle in specialized domains due to the mismatches between the training and target domain distributions. Domain adaptation typically requires costly annotation and retraining of query-document pairs. In this work, we revisit an overlooked alternative: applying PCA to domain embeddings to derive lower-dimensional representations that preserve domain-relevant features while discarding non-discriminative components. Though traditionally used for efficiency, we demonstrate that this simple embedding compression can effectively improve retrieval performance. Evaluated across 9 retrievers and 14 MTEB datasets, PCA applied solely to query embeddings improves NDCG@10 in 75.4% of model-dataset pairs, offering a simple and lightweight method for domain adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13525v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Eliciting Harmful Capabilities by Fine-Tuning On Safeguarded Outputs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13528</link><description>arXiv:2601.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model developers implement safeguards in frontier models to prevent misuse, for example, by employing classifiers to filter dangerous outputs. In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13528v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The OncoReach Stylet for Brachytherapy: Design Evaluation and Pilot Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13529</link><description>arXiv:2601.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cervical cancer accounts for a significant portion of the global cancer burden among women. Interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) is a standard procedure for treating cervical cancer; it involves placing a radioactive source through a straight hollow needle within or in close proximity to the tumor and surrounding tissue. However, the use of straight needles limits surgical planning to a linear needle path. We present the OncoReach stylet, a handheld, tendon-driven steerable stylet designed for compatibility with standard ISBT 15- and 13-gauge needles. Building upon our prior work, we evaluated design parameters like needle gauge, spherical joint count and spherical joint placement, including an asymmetric disk design to identify a configuration that maximizes bending compliance while retaining axial stiffness. Free space experiments quantified tip deflection across configurations, and a two-tube Cosserat rod model accurately predicted the centerline shape of the needle for most trials. The best performing configuration was integrated into a reusable handheld prototype that enables manual actuation. A patient-derived, multi-composite phantom model of the uterus and pelvis was developed to conduct a pilot study of the OncoReach steerable stylet with one expert user. Results showed the ability to steer from less-invasive, medial entry points to reach the lateral-most targets, underscoring the significance of steerable stylets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning While Recommending: Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning in Generative Re-ranking Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13533</link><description>arXiv:2601.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in generative re-ranking scenarios due to its exploration-exploitation capabilities, but existing generative methods mostly fail to adapt to the dynamic entropy changes in model difficulty during list generation, making it challenging to accurately capture complex preferences. Given that language models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs by integrating reasoning capabilities, we draw on this approach to introduce a latent reasoning mechanism, and experimental validation demonstrates that this mechanism effectively reduces entropy in the model's decision-making process. Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the "reason first, recommend later" paradigm to achieve "reasoning while recommending", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness, and its notable advantage lies in being compatible with existing generative re-ranking models to enhance their performance. Further analyses also demonstrate its practical deployment value and research potential.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13533v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MN-TSG:Continuous Time Series Generation with Irregular Observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13534</link><description>arXiv:2601.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) plays a critical role in a wide range of domains, such as healthcare. However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.
  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.
  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.
  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13534v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Distributed-Delay Dynamics via the Linear Chain Trick</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13536</link><description>arXiv:2601.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) framework has been frequently used to discover parsimonious differential equations governing natural and physical systems. This includes recent extensions to SINDy that enable the recovery of discrete delay differential equations, where delay terms are represented explicitly in the candidate library. However, such formulations cannot capture the distributed delays that naturally arise in biological, physical, and engineering systems. In the present work, we extend SINDy to identify distributed-delay differential equations by incorporating the Linear Chain Trick (LCT), which provides a finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation representing the distributed memory effects. Hence, SINDy can operate in an augmented state space using conventional sparse regression while preserving a clear interpretation of delayed influences via the chain trick. From time-series data, the proposed method jointly infers the governing equations, the mean delay, and the dispersion of the underlying delay distribution. We numerically verify the method on several models with distributed delay, including the logistic growth model and a Hes1--mRNA gene regulatory network model. We show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs distributed delay dynamics, remains robust under noise and sparse sampling, and provides a transparent, data-driven approach for discovering nonlinear systems with distributed-delay.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Wording Steers the Evaluation: Framing Bias in LLM judges</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13537</link><description>arXiv:2601.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to produce varying responses depending on prompt phrasing, indicating that subtle guidance in phrasing can steer their answers. However, the impact of this framing bias on LLM-based evaluation, where models are expected to make stable and impartial judgments, remains largely underexplored. Drawing inspiration from the framing effect in psychology, we systematically investigate how deliberate prompt framing skews model judgments across four high-stakes evaluation tasks. We design symmetric prompts using predicate-positive and predicate-negative constructions and demonstrate that such framing induces significant discrepancies in model outputs. Across 14 LLM judges, we observe clear susceptibility to framing, with model families showing distinct tendencies toward agreement or rejection. These findings suggest that framing bias is a structural property of current LLM-based evaluation systems, underscoring the need for framing-aware protocols.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13537v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LongSpeech: A Scalable Benchmark for Transcription, Translation and Understanding in Long Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13539</link><description>arXiv:2601.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-language models have demonstrated remarkable success on short, segment-level speech tasks. However, real-world applications such as meeting transcription, spoken document understanding, and conversational analysis require robust models capable of processing and reasoning over long-form audio. In this work, we present LongSpeech, a large-scale and scalable benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and advance the capabilities of speech models on long-duration audio. LongSpeech comprises over 100,000 speech segments, each approximately 10 minutes long, with rich annotations for ASR, speech translation, summarization, language detection, speaker counting, content separation, and question answering. We introduce a reproducible pipeline for constructing long-form speech benchmarks from diverse sources, enabling future extensions. Our initial experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal significant performance gaps, with models often specializing in one task at the expense of others and struggling with higher-level reasoning. These findings underscore the challenging nature of our benchmark.

Abstract: Evaluating language models and AI agents remains fundamentally challenging because static benchmarks fail to capture real-world uncertainty, distribution shift, and the gap between isolated task accuracy and human-aligned decision-making under evolving conditions. This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures Large Language Models (LLMs) not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts.

Abstract: LLM-driven Anomaly Detection (AD) helps enhance the understanding and explanatory abilities of anomalous behaviors in Time Series (TS). Existing methods face challenges of inadequate reasoning ability, deficient multi-turn dialogue capability, and narrow generalization. To this end, we 1) propose a multi-agent-based TS Evolution algorithm named TSEvol. On top of it, we 2) introduce the AD reasoning and multi-turn dialogue Dataset TSEData-20K and contribute the Chatbot family for AD, including ChatAD-Llama3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Mistral-7B. Furthermore, 3) we propose the TS Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (TKTO) to enhance ChatAD's cross-task generalization capability. Lastly, 4) we propose a LLM-driven Learning-based AD Benchmark LLADBench to evaluate the performance of ChatAD and nine baselines across seven datasets and tasks. Our three ChatAD models achieve substantial gains, up to 34.50% in accuracy, 34.71% in F1, and a 37.42% reduction in false positives. Besides, via KTKO, our optimized ChatAD achieves competitive performance in reasoning and cross-task generalization on classification, forecasting, and imputation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13546v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HateXScore: A Metric Suite for Evaluating Reasoning Quality in Hate Speech Explanations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13547</link><description>arXiv:2601.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hateful speech detection is a key component of content moderation, yet current evaluation frameworks rarely assess why a text is deemed hateful. We introduce \textsf{HateXScore}, a four-component metric suite designed to evaluate the reasoning quality of model explanations. It assesses (i) conclusion explicitness, (ii) faithfulness and causal grounding of quoted spans, (iii) protected group identification (policy-configurable), and (iv) logical consistency among these elements. Evaluated on six diverse hate speech datasets, \textsf{HateXScore} is intended as a diagnostic complement to reveal interpretability failures and annotation inconsistencies that are invisible to standard metrics like Accuracy or F1. Moreover, human evaluation shows strong agreement with \textsf{HateXScore}, validating it as a practical tool for trustworthy and transparent moderation.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how neural networks generalize beyond their training data by reverse-engineering their internal structures. We introduce patterning as the dual problem: given a desired form of generalization, determine what training data produces it. Our approach is based on susceptibilities, which measure how posterior expectation values of observables respond to infinitesimal shifts in the data distribution. Inverting this linear response relationship yields the data intervention that steers the model toward a target internal configuration. We demonstrate patterning in a small language model, showing that re-weighting training data along principal susceptibility directions can accelerate or delay the formation of structure, such as the induction circuit. In a synthetic parentheses balancing task where multiple algorithms achieve perfect training accuracy, we show that patterning can select which algorithm the model learns by targeting the local learning coefficient of each solution. These results establish that the same mathematical framework used to read internal structure can be inverted to write it.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffFace-Edit: A Diffusion-Based Facial Dataset for Forgery-Semantic Driven Deepfake Detection Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13551</link><description>arXiv:2601.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models now produce imperceptible, fine-grained manipulated faces, posing significant privacy risks. However, existing AI-generated face datasets generally lack focus on samples with fine-grained regional manipulations. Furthermore, no researchers have yet studied the real impact of splice attacks, which occur between real and manipulated samples, on detectors. We refer to these as detector-evasive samples. Based on this, we introduce the DiffFace-Edit dataset, which has the following advantages: 1) It contains over two million AI-generated fake images. 2) It features edits across eight facial regions (e.g., eyes, nose) and includes a richer variety of editing combinations, such as single-region and multi-region edits. Additionally, we specifically analyze the impact of detector-evasive samples on detection models. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and propose a cross-domain evaluation that combines IMDL methods.

Abstract: Simulated environments play an essential role in embodied AI, functionally analogous to test cases in software engineering. However, existing environment generation methods often emphasize visual realism (e.g., object diversity and layout coherence), overlooking a crucial aspect: logical diversity from the testing perspective. This limits the comprehensive evaluation of agent adaptability and planning robustness in distinct simulated environments. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicEnvGen, a novel method driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that adopts a top-down paradigm to generate logically diverse simulated environments as test cases for agents. Given an agent task, LogicEnvGen first analyzes its execution logic to construct decision-tree-structured behavior plans and then synthesizes a set of logical trajectories. Subsequently, it adopts a heuristic algorithm to refine the trajectory set, reducing redundant simulation. For each logical trajectory, which represents a potential task situation, LogicEnvGen correspondingly instantiates a concrete environment. Notably, it employs constraint solving for physical plausibility. Furthermore, we introduce LogicEnvEval, a novel benchmark comprising four quantitative metrics for environment evaluation. Experimental results verify the lack of logical diversity in baselines and demonstrate that LogicEnvGen achieves 1.04-2.61x greater diversity, significantly improving the performance in revealing agent faults by 4.00%-68.00%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13556v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging ChatGPT and Other NLP Methods for Identifying Risk and Protective Behaviors in MSM: Social Media and Dating apps Text Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13558</link><description>arXiv:2601.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at elevated risk for sexually transmitted infections and harmful drinking compared to heterosexual men. Text data collected from social media and dating applications may provide new opportunities for personalized public health interventions by enabling automatic identification of risk and protective behaviors. In this study, we evaluated whether text from social media and dating apps can be used to predict sexual risk behaviors, alcohol use, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among MSM. With participant consent, we collected textual data and trained machine learning models using features derived from ChatGPT embeddings, BERT embeddings, LIWC, and a dictionary-based risk term approach. The models achieved strong performance in predicting monthly binge drinking and having more than five sexual partners, with F1 scores of 0.78, and moderate performance in predicting PrEP use and heavy drinking, with F1 scores of 0.64 and 0.63. These findings demonstrate that social media and dating app text data can provide valuable insights into risk and protective behaviors and highlight the potential of large language model-based methods to support scalable and personalized public health interventions for MSM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13558v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgentGC: Evolutionary Learning-based Lossless Compression for Genomics Data with LLM-driven Multiple Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13559</link><description>arXiv:2601.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lossless compression has made significant advancements in Genomics Data (GD) storage, sharing and management. Current learning-based methods are non-evolvable with problems of low-level compression modeling, limited adaptability, and user-unfriendly interface. To this end, we propose AgentGC, the first evolutionary Agent-based GD Compressor, consisting of 3 layers with multi-agent named Leader and Worker. Specifically, the 1) User layer provides a user-friendly interface via Leader combined with LLM; 2) Cognitive layer, driven by the Leader, integrates LLM to consider joint optimization of algorithm-dataset-system, addressing the issues of low-level modeling and limited adaptability; and 3) Compression layer, headed by Worker, performs compression &amp; decompression via a automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression framework. On top of AgentGC, we design 3 modes to support diverse scenarios: CP for compression-ratio priority, TP for throughput priority, and BM for balanced mode. Compared with 14 baselines on 9 datasets, the average compression ratios gains are 16.66%, 16.11%, and 16.33%, the throughput gains are 4.73x, 9.23x, and 9.15x, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13559v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning is a Modality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13562</link><description>arXiv:2601.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) provides a compact laboratory for studying abstract reasoning, an ability central to human intelligence. Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly. Qualitatively, our models exhibit more coherent rule-application structure than the dense ViT baseline, consistent with a shift away from plausible probability blobs toward controller-driven reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13562v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ButterflyMoE: Sub-Linear Ternary Experts via Structured Butterfly Orbits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13563</link><description>arXiv:2601.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear memory scaling stores $N$ independent expert weight matrices requiring $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot d^2)$ memory, which exceeds edge devices memory budget. Current compression methods like quantization, pruning and low-rank factorization reduce constant factors but leave the scaling bottleneck unresolved. We introduce ButterflyMoE, a method that treats experts not as independent weight matrices but as geometric reorientations of a unified shared quantized substrate. Diversity among experts arises from viewing different angles of shared capacity, not from redundant storage. By applying learned rotations to a shared ternary prototype, each expert yields $\mathcal{O}(d^2 + N \cdot d \log d)$ memory -- sub-linear in the number of experts. The key insight: training these rotations with quantization reduces activation outliers and stabilizes extreme low bit training, where static methods collapse. Across language modeling benchmarks, ButterflyMoE achieves 150 times memory reduction at 256 experts with negligible accuracy loss. This allows 64 experts to fit on 4GB devices compared to standard MoE's 8 experts, showing geometric parametrization breaks linear scaling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-objective fluorescent molecule design with a data-physics dual-driven generative framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13564</link><description>arXiv:2601.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing fluorescent small molecules with tailored optical and physicochemical properties requires navigating vast, underexplored chemical space while satisfying multiple objectives and constraints. Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13564v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Fine-Grained Correspondence with Cross-Perspective Perception for Open-Vocabulary 6D Object Pose Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13565</link><description>arXiv:2601.13565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 6D object pose estimation empowers robots to manipulate arbitrary unseen objects guided solely by natural language. However, a critical limitation of existing approaches is their reliance on unconstrained global matching strategies. In open-world scenarios, trying to match anchor features against the entire query image space introduces excessive ambiguity, as target features are easily confused with background distractors. To resolve this, we propose Fine-grained Correspondence Pose Estimation (FiCoP), a framework that transitions from noise-prone global matching to spatially-constrained patch-level correspondence. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a patch-to-patch correlation matrix as a structural prior to narrowing the matching scope, effectively filtering out irrelevant clutter to prevent it from degrading pose estimation. Firstly, we introduce an object-centric disentanglement preprocessing to isolate the semantic target from environmental noise. Secondly, a Cross-Perspective Global Perception (CPGP) module is proposed to fuse dual-view features, establishing structural consensus through explicit context reasoning. Finally, we design a Patch Correlation Predictor (PCP) that generates a precise block-wise association map, acting as a spatial filter to enforce fine-grained, noise-resilient matching. Experiments on the REAL275 and Toyota-Light datasets demonstrate that FiCoP improves Average Recall by 8.0% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method, highlighting its capability to deliver robust and generalized perception for robotic agents operating in complex, unconstrained open-world environments.

Abstract: Can language models improve their accuracy without external supervision? Methods such as debate, bootstrap, and internal coherence maximization achieve this surprising feat, even matching golden finetuning performance. Yet why they work remains theoretically unclear. We show that they are all special cases of coherence optimization: finding a context-to-behavior mapping that's most compressible and jointly predictable. We prove that coherence optimization is equivalent to description-length regularization, and that among all such regularization schemes, it is optimal for semi-supervised learning when the regularizer is derived from a pretrained model. Our theory, supported by preliminary experiments, explains why feedback-free self-improvement works and predicts when it should succeed or fail.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13566v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DRGW: Learning Disentangled Representations for Robust Graph Watermarking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13569</link><description>arXiv:2601.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-structured data is foundational to numerous web applications, and watermarking is crucial for protecting their intellectual property and ensuring data provenance. Existing watermarking methods primarily operate on graph structures or entangled graph representations, which compromise the transparency and robustness of watermarks due to the information coupling in representing graphs and uncontrollable discretization in transforming continuous numerical representations into graph structures. This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks. Additionally, we develop a structure-aware editor that resolves the issue of latent modifications into discrete graph edits, ensuring robustness against structural perturbations. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of DRGW.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GeoDynamics: A Geometric State-Space Neural Network for Understanding Brain Dynamics on Riemannian Manifolds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13570</link><description>arXiv:2601.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have become a cornerstone for unraveling brain dynamics, revealing how latent neural states evolve over time and give rise to observed signals. By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13570v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic Dynamic Pricing of Electric Vehicle Charging with Heterogeneous User Behavior: A Stackelberg Game Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13571</link><description>arXiv:2601.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces complex spatiotemporal demand management challenges for charging station operators (CSOs), exacerbated by demand imbalances, behavioral heterogeneity, and system uncertainty. Traditional dynamic pricing models, often relying on deterministic EV-CS pairings and network equilibrium assumptions, frequently oversimplify user behavior and lack scalability. This study proposes a stochastic, behaviorally heterogeneous dynamic pricing framework formulated as a bi-level Stackelberg game. The upper level optimizes time-varying pricing to maximize system-wide utility, while the lower level models decentralized EV users via a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model incorporating price sensitivity, battery aging, risk attitudes, and network travel costs. Crucially, the model avoids network equilibrium constraints to enhance scalability, with congestion effects represented via queuing-theoretic approximations. To efficiently solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem, a rolling-horizon approach combining the Dynamic Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis-guided Cross-Entropy Method (PSA-CEM) with the Method of Successive Averages (MSA) is implemented. A real-world case study in Clayton, Melbourne, validates the framework using 22 charging stations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism substantially reduces queuing penalties and improves user utility compared to fixed and time-of-use pricing. The framework provides a robust, scalable tool for strategic EV charging management, balancing realism with computational efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13571v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Behavior Knowledge Merge in Reinforced Agentic Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13572</link><description>arXiv:2601.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to post-training, particularly for agentic models that require specialized reasoning behaviors. In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13572v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TRGCN: A Hybrid Framework for Social Network Rumor Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13573</link><description>arXiv:2601.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient rumor detection is critical for information governance, particularly in the context of the rapid spread of misinformation on social networks. Traditional rumor detection relied primarily on manual analysis. With the continuous advancement of technology, machine learning and deep learning approaches for rumor identification have gradually emerged and gained prominence. However, previous approaches often struggle to simultaneously capture both the sequential and the global structural relationships among topological nodes within a social network. To tackle this issue, we introduce a hybrid model for detecting rumors that integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a Transformer architecture, aiming to leverage the complementary strengths of structural and semantic feature extraction. Positional encoding helps preserve the sequential order of these nodes within the propagation structure. The use of Multi-head attention mechanisms enables the model to capture features across diverse representational subspaces, thereby enhancing both the richness and depth of text comprehension. This integration allows the framework to concurrently identify the key propagation network of rumors, the textual content, the long-range dependencies, and the sequence among propagation nodes. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets, including Twitter 15 and Twitter 16, demonstrate that our proposed fusion model significantly outperforms both standalone models and existing mainstream methods in terms of accuracy. These results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach for the rumor detection task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13573v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Highly Deformable Proprioceptive Membrane for Real-Time 3D Shape Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13574</link><description>arXiv:2601.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of object surfaces is essential for robot perception, yet vision-based approaches are generally unreliable under low illumination or occlusion. This limitation motivates the design of a proprioceptive membrane that conforms to the surface of interest and infers 3D geometry by reconstructing its own deformation. Conventional shape-aware membranes typically rely on resistive, capacitive, or magneto-sensitive mechanisms. However, these methods often encounter challenges such as structural complexity, limited compliance during large-scale deformation, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. This work presents a soft, flexible, and stretchable proprioceptive silicone membrane based on optical waveguide sensing. The membrane sensor integrates edge-mounted LEDs and centrally distributed photodiodes (PDs), interconnected via liquid-metal traces embedded within a multilayer elastomeric composite. Rich deformation-dependent light intensity signals are decoded by a data-driven model to recover the membrane geometry as a 3D point cloud. On a customized 140 mm square membrane, real-time reconstruction of large-scale out-of-plane deformation is achieved at 90 Hz with an average reconstruction error of 1.3 mm, measured by Chamfer distance, while maintaining accuracy for indentations up to 25 mm. The proposed framework provides a scalable, robust, and low-profile solution for global shape perception in deformable robotic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13574v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Comparing Without Saying: A Dataset and Benchmark for Implicit Comparative Opinion Mining from Same-User Reviews</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13575</link><description>arXiv:2601.13575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies on comparative opinion mining have mainly focused on explicit comparative expressions, which are uncommon in real-world reviews.

We benchmark this task using two baseline architectures: traditional machine learning- and language model-based baselines. Experimental results show that while the latter outperforms the former, overall performance remains moderate, revealing the inherent difficulty of the task and establishing SUDO as a challenging and valuable benchmark for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13575v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Kubernetes custom scheduler based on reinforcement learning for compute-intensive pods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13579</link><description>arXiv:2601.13579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of cloud computing and lightweight containers, Docker has emerged as a leading technology for rapid service deployment, with Kubernetes responsible for pod orchestration. However, for compute-intensive workloads-particularly web services executing containerized machine-learning training-the default Kubernetes scheduler does not always achieve optimal placement. To address this, we propose two custom, reinforcement-learning-based schedulers, SDQN and SDQN-n, both built on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework. In compute-intensive scenarios, these models outperform the default Kubernetes scheduler as well as Transformer-and LSTM-based alternatives, reducing average CPU utilization per cluster node by 10%, and by over 20% when using SDQN-n. Moreover, our results show that SDQN-n approach of consolidating pods onto fewer nodes further amplifies resource savings and helps advance greener, more energy-efficient data centers.Therefore, pod scheduling must employ different strategies tailored to each scenario in order to achieve better performance.Since the reinforcement-learning components of the SDQN and SDQN-n architectures proposed in this paper can be easily tuned by adjusting their parameters, they can accommodate the requirements of various future scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13579v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Organ Transplantation (NOT): Checkpoint-Based Modular Adaptation for Transformer Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13580</link><description>arXiv:2601.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Organ Transplantation (NOT), a modular adaptation framework that enables trained transformer layers to function as reusable transferable checkpoints for domain adaptation. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets ("donor organs") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13580v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SCRIPTMIND: Crime Script Inference and Cognitive Evaluation for LLM-based Social Engineering Scam Detection System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13581</link><description>arXiv:2601.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social engineering scams increasingly employ personalized, multi-turn deception, exposing the limits of traditional detection methods. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in identifying deception, their cognitive assistance potential remains underexplored. We propose ScriptMind, an integrated framework for LLM-based scam detection that bridges automated reasoning and human cognition. It comprises three components: the Crime Script Inference Task (CSIT) for scam reasoning, the Crime Script-Aware Inference Dataset (CSID) for fine-tuning small LLMs, and the Cognitive Simulation-based Evaluation of Social Engineering Defense (CSED) for assessing real-time cognitive impact. Using 571 Korean phone scam cases, we built 22,712 structured scammer-sequence training instances. Experimental results show that the 11B small LLM fine-tuned with ScriptMind outperformed GPT-4o by 13%, achieving superior performance over commercial models in detection accuracy, false-positive reduction, scammer utterance prediction, and rationale quality. Moreover, in phone scam simulation experiments, it significantly enhanced and sustained users' suspicion levels, improving their cognitive awareness of scams. ScriptMind represents a step toward human-centered, cognitively adaptive LLMs for scam defense.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13581v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nonlinear fractional-periodic boundary value problems with Hilfer fractional derivative: existence and numerical approximations of solutions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13584</link><description>arXiv:2601.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove conditions for existence of analytical solutions for boundary value problems with the Hilfer fractional derivative, generalizing the commonly used Riemann-Liouville and Caputo operators. The boundary values, referred to in this paper as fractional-periodic, are fractional integral conditions generalizing recurrent solution values for the non-Caputo case of the Hilfer fractional derivative. Analytical solutions to the studied problem are obtained using a perturbation of the corresponding initial value problem with enforced boundary conditions. In general, solutions to the boundary value problem are singular for $t\downarrow 0$. To overcome this singularity, we construct a sequence of converging solutions in a weighted continuous function space. We present a Bernstein splines-based implementation to numerically approximate solutions. We prove convergence of the numerical method, providing convergence criteria and asymptotic convergence rates. Numerical examples show empirical convergence results corresponding with the theoretical bounds. Moreover, the method is able to approximate the singular behavior of solutions and is demonstrated to converge for nonlinear problems. Finally, we apply a grid search to obtain correspondence to the original, non-perturbed system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13584v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TREX: Tokenizer Regression for Optimal Data Mixture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13588</link><description>arXiv:2601.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building effective tokenizers for multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) requires careful control over language-specific data mixtures. While a tokenizer's compression performance critically affects the efficiency of LLM training and inference, existing approaches rely on heuristics or costly large-scale searches to determine optimal language ratios. We introduce Tokenizer Regression for Optimal Data MiXture (TREX), a regression-based framework that efficiently predicts the optimal data mixture for tokenizer training. TREX trains small-scale proxy tokenizers on random mixtures, gathers their compression statistics, and learns to predict compression performance from data mixtures. This learned model enables scalable mixture search before large-scale tokenizer training, mitigating the accuracy-cost trade-off in multilingual tokenizer design. Tokenizers trained with TReX's predicted mixtures outperform mixtures based on LLaMA3 and uniform distributions by up to 12% in both inand out-of-distribution compression efficiency, demonstrating strong scalability, robustness, and practical effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Motion-to-Response Content Generation via Multi-Agent AI System with Real-Time Safety Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13589</link><description>arXiv:2601.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-agent artificial intelligence system that generates response-oriented media content in real time based on audio-derived emotional signals. Unlike conventional speech emotion recognition studies that focus primarily on classification accuracy, our approach emphasizes the transformation of inferred emotional states into safe, age-appropriate, and controllable response content through a structured pipeline of specialized AI agents. The proposed system comprises four cooperative agents: (1) an Emotion Recognition Agent with CNN-based acoustic feature extraction, (2) a Response Policy Decision Agent for mapping emotions to response modes, (3) a Content Parameter Generation Agent for producing media control parameters, and (4) a Safety Verification Agent enforcing age-appropriateness and stimulation constraints. We introduce an explicit safety verification loop that filters generated content before output, ensuring compliance with predefined rules. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the system achieves 73.2% emotion recognition accuracy, 89.4% response mode consistency, and 100% safety compliance while maintaining sub-100ms inference latency suitable for on-device deployment. The modular architecture enables interpretability and extensibility, making it applicable to child-adjacent media, therapeutic applications, and emotionally responsive smart devices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vulnerability of LLMs' Belief Systems? LLMs Belief Resistance Check Through Strategic Persuasive Conversation Interventions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13590</link><description>arXiv:2601.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in various question-answering tasks. However, recent studies showcase that LLMs are susceptible to persuasion and could adopt counterfactual beliefs. We present a systematic evaluation of LLM susceptibility to persuasion under the Source--Message--Channel--Receiver (SMCR) communication framework. Across five mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) and three domains (factual knowledge, medical QA, and social bias), we analyze how different persuasive strategies influence belief stability over multiple interaction turns. We further examine whether meta-cognition prompting (i.e., eliciting self-reported confidence) affects resistance to persuasion. Results show that smaller models exhibit extreme compliance, with over 80% of belief changes occurring at the first persuasive turn (average end turn of 1.1--1.4). Contrary to expectations, meta-cognition prompting increases vulnerability by accelerating belief erosion rather than enhancing robustness. Finally, we evaluate adversarial fine-tuning as a defense. While GPT-4o-mini achieves near-complete robustness (98.6%) and Mistral~7B improves substantially (35.7% $\rightarrow$ 79.3%), Llama models remain highly susceptible (&lt;14%) even when fine-tuned on their own failure cases. Together, these findings highlight substantial model-dependent limits of current robustness interventions and offer guidance for developing more trustworthy LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13590v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DSAEval: Evaluating Data Science Agents on a Wide Range of Real-World Data Science Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13591</link><description>arXiv:2601.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent LLM-based data agents aim to automate data science tasks ranging from data analysis to deep learning. However, the open-ended nature of real-world data science problems, which often span multiple taxonomies and lack standard answers, poses a significant challenge for evaluation. To address this, we introduce DSAEval, a benchmark comprising 641 real-world data science problems grounded in 285 diverse datasets, covering both structured and unstructured data (e.g., vision and text). DSAEval incorporates three distinctive features: (1) Multimodal Environment Perception, which enables agents to interpret observations from multiple modalities including text and vision; (2) Multi-Query Interactions, which mirror the iterative and cumulative nature of real-world data science projects; and (3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation, which provides a holistic assessment across reasoning, code, and results. We systematically evaluate 11 advanced agentic LLMs using DSAEval. Our results show that Claude-Sonnet-4.5 achieves the strongest overall performance, GPT-5.2 is the most efficient, and MiMo-V2-Flash is the most cost-effective. We further demonstrate that multimodal perception consistently improves performance on vision-related tasks, with gains ranging from 2.04% to 11.30%. Overall, while current data science agents perform well on structured data and routine data anlysis workflows, substantial challenges remain in unstructured domains. Finally, we offer critical insights and outline future research directions to advance the development of data science agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13591v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning based radiative parameterization scheme and its performance in operational reforecast experiments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13592</link><description>arXiv:2601.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation is typically the most time-consuming physical process in numerical models. One solution is to use machine learning methods to simulate the radiation process to improve computational efficiency. From an operational standpoint, this study investigates critical limitations inherent to hybrid forecasting frameworks that embed deep neural networks into numerical prediction models, with a specific focus on two fundamental bottlenecks: coupling compatibility and long-term integration stability. A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13592v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI IDEs or Autonomous Agents?

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based coding agents increasingly act as autonomous contributors that generate and merge pull requests, yet their real-world effects on software projects are unclear, especially relative to widely adopted IDE-based AI assistants. We present a longitudinal causal study of agent adoption in open-source repositories using staggered difference-in-differences with matched controls. Using the AIDev dataset, we define adoption as the first agent-generated pull request and analyze monthly repository-level outcomes spanning development velocity (commits, lines added) and software quality (static-analysis warnings, cognitive complexity, duplication, and comment density). Results show large, front-loaded velocity gains only when agents are the first observable AI tool in a project; repositories with prior AI IDE usage experience minimal or short-lived throughput benefits. In contrast, quality risks are persistent across settings, with static-analysis warnings and cognitive complexity rising roughly 18% and 35%, indicating sustained agent-induced complexity debt even when velocity advantages fade. These heterogeneous effects suggest diminishing returns to AI assistance and highlight the need for quality safeguards, provenance tracking, and selective deployment of autonomous agents. Our findings establish an empirical basis for understanding how agentic and IDE-based tools interact, and motivate research on balancing acceleration with maintainability in AI-integrated development workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13597v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion In Diffusion: Breaking the Autoregressive Bottleneck in Block Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13599</link><description>arXiv:2601.13599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block diffusion language models, operating as semi-autoregressive paradigms, combine the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion paradigms. However, their strict unidirectional block dependencies introduce irreversibility and sacrifice the global planning capabilities for which diffusion models are renowned. In order to address these issues, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a draft-then-refine framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilise snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset. Using just 26% of the fine-tuning budget of baseline models, we reduce generative perplexity from 25.7 to 21.9, significantly narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13599v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Foundations of Global Consistency Checking with Noisy LLM Oracles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13600</link><description>arXiv:2601.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that collections of natural-language facts are globally consistent is essential for tasks such as fact-checking, summarization, and knowledge base construction. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can assess the consistency of small subsets of facts, their judgments are noisy, and pairwise checks are insufficient to guarantee global coherence. We formalize this problem and show that verifying global consistency requires exponentially many oracle queries in the worst case. To make the task practical, we propose an adaptive divide-and-conquer algorithm that identifies minimal inconsistent subsets (MUSes) of facts and optionally computes minimal repairs through hitting-sets. Our approach has low-degree polynomial query complexity. Experiments with both synthetic and real LLM oracles show that our method efficiently detects and localizes inconsistencies, offering a scalable framework for linguistic consistency verification with LLM-based evaluators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Elementary Approach to Scheduling in Generative Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13602</link><description>arXiv:2601.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elementary approach to characterizing the impact of noise scheduling and time discretization in generative diffusion models is developed. Considering a simplified model where the source distribution is multivariate Gaussian with a given covariance matrix, the explicit closed-form evolution trajectory of the distributions across reverse sampling steps is derived, and consequently, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source distribution and the reverse sampling output is obtained. The effect of the number of time discretization steps on the convergence of this KL divergence is studied via the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. An optimization problem is formulated, and its solution noise schedule is obtained via calculus of variations, shown to follow a tangent law whose coefficient is determined by the eigenvalues of the source covariance matrix. For an alternative scenario, more realistic in practice, where pretrained models have been obtained for some given noise schedules, the KL divergence also provides a measure to compare different time discretization strategies in reverse sampling. Experiments across different datasets and pretrained models demonstrate that the time discretization strategy selected by our approach consistently outperforms baseline and search-based strategies, particularly when the budget on the number of function evaluations is very tight.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13602v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DCCVT: Differentiable Clipped Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13603</link><description>arXiv:2601.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Marching Cubes (MC) and Marching Tetrahedra (MTet) are widely adopted in 3D reconstruction pipelines due to their simplicity and efficiency, their differentiable variants remain suboptimal for mesh extraction. This often limits the quality of 3D meshes reconstructed from point clouds or images in learning-based frameworks. In contrast, clipped CVTs offer stronger theoretical guarantees and yield higher-quality meshes. However, the lack of a differentiable formulation has prevented their integration into modern machine learning pipelines. To bridge this gap, we propose DCCVT, a differentiable algorithm that extracts high-quality 3D meshes from noisy signed distance fields (SDFs) using clipped CVTs. We derive a fully differentiable formulation for computing clipped CVTs and demonstrate its integration with deep learning-based SDF estimation to reconstruct accurate 3D meshes from input point clouds. Our experiments with synthetic data demonstrate the superior ability of DCCVT against state-of-the-art methods in mesh quality and reconstruction fidelity. https://wylliamcantincharawi.dev/DCCVT.github.io/</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13603v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimizing Parallel Schemes with Lyapunov Exponents and kNN-LLE Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13604</link><description>arXiv:2601.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse parallel schemes remain indispensable tools for computing the roots of nonlinear systems, yet their dynamical behavior can be unexpectedly rich, ranging from strong contraction to oscillatory or chaotic transients depending on the choice of algorithmic parameters and initial states. A unified analytical-data-driven methodology for identifying, measuring, and reducing such instabilities in a family of uni-parametric inverse parallel solvers is presented in this study. On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis. Leveraging this correspondence, we introduce a Lyapunov-informed parameter selection strategy that identifies solver settings associated with stable behavior, particularly when the estimated LLE indicates persistent instability. Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness. The study establishes micro-series Lyapunov analysis as a practical, interpretable tool for constructing self-stabilizing root-finding schemes and opens avenues for extending such diagnostics to higher-dimensional or noise-contaminated problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13604v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ChartVerse: Scaling Chart Reasoning via Reliable Programmatic Synthesis from Scratch</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13606</link><description>arXiv:2601.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chart reasoning is a critical capability for Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, the development of open-source models is severely hindered by the lack of high-quality training data. Existing datasets suffer from a dual challenge: synthetic charts are often simplistic and repetitive, while the associated QA pairs are prone to hallucinations and lack the reasoning depth required for complex tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartVerse, a scalable framework designed to synthesize complex charts and reliable reasoning data from scratch. (1) To address the bottleneck of simple patterns, we first introduce Rollout Posterior Entropy (RPE), a novel metric that quantifies chart complexity. Guided by RPE, we develop complexity-aware chart coder to autonomously synthesize diverse, high-complexity charts via executable programs. (2) To guarantee reasoning rigor, we develop truth-anchored inverse QA synthesis. Diverging from standard generation, we adopt an answer-first paradigm: we extract deterministic answers directly from the source code, generate questions conditional on these anchors, and enforce strict consistency verification. To further elevate difficulty and reasoning depth, we filter samples based on model fail-rate and distill high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We curate ChartVerse-SFT-600K and ChartVerse-RL-40K using Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking as the teacher. Experimental results demonstrate that ChartVerse-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably surpassing its teacher and rivaling the stronger Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13606v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Reasoning Leaks Membership: Membership Inference Attack on Black-box Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13607</link><description>arXiv:2601.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have rapidly gained prominence for their strong performance in solving complex tasks. Many modern black-box LRMs expose the intermediate reasoning traces through APIs to improve transparency (e.g., Gemini-2.5 and Claude-sonnet). Despite their benefits, we find that these traces can leak membership signals, creating a new privacy threat even without access to token logits used in prior attacks. In this work, we initiate the first systematic exploration of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on black-box LRMs. Our preliminary analysis shows that LRMs produce confident, recall-like reasoning traces on familiar training member samples but more hesitant, inference-like reasoning traces on non-members. The representations of these traces are continuously distributed in the semantic latent space, spanning from familiar to unfamiliar samples. Building on this observation, we propose BlackSpectrum, the first membership inference attack framework targeting the black-box LRMs. The key idea is to construct a recall-inference axis in the semantic latent space, based on representations derived from the exposed traces. By locating where a query sample falls along this axis, the attacker can obtain a membership score and predict how likely it is to be a member of the training data. Additionally, to address the limitations of outdated datasets unsuited to modern LRMs, we provide two new datasets to support future research, arXivReasoning and BookReasoning. Empirically, exposing reasoning traces significantly increases the vulnerability of LRMs to membership inference attacks, leading to large gains in attack performance. Our findings highlight the need for LRM companies to balance transparency in intermediate reasoning traces with privacy preservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13607v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fisher-Informed Parameterwise Aggregation for Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13608</link><description>arXiv:2601.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning aggregates model updates from distributed clients, but standard first order methods such as FedAvg apply the same scalar weight to all parameters from each client. Under non-IID data, these uniformly weighted updates can be strongly misaligned across clients, causing client drift and degrading the global model. Here we propose Fisher-Informed Parameterwise Aggregation (FIPA), a second-order aggregation method that replaces client-level scalar weights with parameter-specific Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) weights, enabling true parameter-level scaling that captures how each client's data uniquely influences different parameters. With low-rank approximation, FIPA remains communication- and computation-efficient. Across nonlinear function regression, PDE learning, and image classification, FIPA consistently improves over averaging-based aggregation, and can be effectively combined with state-of-the-art client-side optimization algorithms to further improve image classification accuracy. These results highlight the benefits of FIPA for federated learning under heterogeneous data distributions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13608v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Balancing Fairness and High Match Rates in Reciprocal Recommender Systems: A Nash Social Welfare Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13609</link><description>arXiv:2601.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching platforms, such as online dating services and job recommendations, have become increasingly prevalent. For the success of these platforms, it is crucial to design reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that not only increase the total number of matches but also avoid creating unfairness among users. In this paper, we investigate the fairness of RRSs on matching platforms. From the perspective of fair division, we define the users' opportunities to be recommended and establish the fairness concept of envy-freeness in the allocation of these opportunities. We first introduce the Social Welfare (SW) method, which approximately maximizes the number of matches, and show that it leads to significant unfairness in recommendation opportunities, illustrating the trade-off between fairness and match rates. To address this challenge, we propose the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) method, which alternately optimizes two NSW functions and achieves nearly envy-free recommendations. We further generalize the SW and NSW method to the $\alpha$-SW method, which balances the trade-off between fairness and high match rates. Additionally, we develop a computationally efficient approximation algorithm for the SW/NSW/$\alpha$-SW methods based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13609v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Secure Multi-Path Routing with All-or-Nothing Transform for Network-on-Chip Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13610</link><description>arXiv:2601.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring Network-on-Chip (NoC) security is crucial to design trustworthy NoC-based System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. While there are various threats that exploit on-chip communication vulnerabilities, eavesdropping attacks via malicious nodes are among the most common and stealthy. Although encryption can secure packets for confidentiality, it may introduce unacceptable overhead for resource-constrained SoCs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight confidentiality-preserving framework that utilizes a quasi-group based All-Or-Nothing Transform (AONT) combined with secure multi-path routing in NoC-based SoCs. By applying AONT to each packet and distributing its transformed blocks across multiple non-overlapping routes, we ensure that no intermediate router can reconstruct the original data without all blocks. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively mitigates eavesdropping attacks by malicious routers with negligible area and performance overhead.

Compared to text-based applications, their security is far more critical: a successful prompt injection attack does not just alter outputs but can directly misguide physical navigation, leading to unsafe routes, mission failure, or real-world harm. Despite this high-stakes setting, the vulnerability of navigation agents to prompt injection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose PINA, an adaptive prompt optimization framework tailored to navigation agents under black-box, long-context, and action-executable constraints. Experiments on indoor and outdoor navigation agents show that PINA achieves high attack success rates with an average ASR of 87.5%, surpasses all baselines, and remains robust under ablation and adaptive-attack conditions. This work provides the first systematic investigation of prompt injection attacks in navigation and highlights their urgent security implications for embodied LLM agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13612v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CauScientist: Teaching LLMs to Respect Data for Causal Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13614</link><description>arXiv:2601.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific understanding and reliable decision-making. Existing approaches face critical limitations: purely data-driven methods suffer from statistical indistinguishability and modeling assumptions, while recent LLM-based methods either ignore statistical evidence or incorporate unverified priors that can mislead result. To this end, we propose CauScientist, a collaborative framework that synergizes LLMs as hypothesis-generating "data scientists" with probabilistic statistics as rigorous "verifiers". CauScientist employs hybrid initialization to select superior starting graphs, iteratively refines structures through LLM-proposed modifications validated by statistical criteria, and maintains error memory to guide efficient search space. Experiments demonstrate that CauScientist substantially outperforms purely data-driven baselines, achieving up to 53.8% F1 score improvement and enhancing recall from 35.0% to 100.0%. Notably, while standalone LLM performance degrades with graph complexity, CauScientist reduces structural hamming distance (SHD) by 44.0% compared to Qwen3-32B on 37-node graphs.

Abstract: Hybrid microgrids integrating Grid-Following (GFL) and Grid-Forming (GFM) inverters present complex control challenges arising from the decoupling between long-term economic dispatch and real-time dynamic regulation, as well as the distinct physical limitations of heterogeneous inverters under cyber uncertainties. This paper proposes a Resilient Hierarchical Power Control (RHPC) strategy to unify these conflicting requirements within a cohesive framework. A standardized power increment mechanism is developed to bridge the tertiary and secondary layers, ensuring that real-time load fluctuations are compensated strictly according to the optimal economic ratios derived from the tertiary layer. To address the strict active power saturation constraints of GFL units, a dynamic activation scheme coupled with projection operators is introduced, which actively isolates saturated nodes from the consensus loop to prevent integrator wind-up and preserve the stability of the GFM backbone. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates a multi-scale attention mechanism and LSTM-based predictors into the secondary control protocol, endowing the system with robustness against unbounded False Data Injection (FDI) attacks and packet losses. Rigorous theoretical analysis confirms that the system achieves Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB) convergence, and simulations on a modified IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves power sharing accuracy and operational resilience in both grid-connected and islanded modes compared to conventional methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13615v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reflections over the Sea: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Maritime Self-Powered Communications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13618</link><description>arXiv:2601.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maritime communication is becoming a vital component of 6G networks, driven by the rapid expansion of the maritime economy. However, existing technologies face critical challenges in signal coverage, availability, and robustness, especially under harsh sea conditions. This paper proposes a novel framework for the maritime Internet-of-Things (IoT) communications that leverages the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) mounted on offshore infrastructures, such as wind turbines, to enhance coverage and reliability. To capture dynamic maritime environment, a near-ocean-surface channel model is developed considering the impact of sea waves. In addition, a wave energy harvesting (EH) system is designed to self-power IoT sensors for data acquisition, processing, and transmission. To support real-time adaptation, channel state information is continuously measured to optimize RIS reflection parameters and maximize multi-user communication rates. Simulation results show that the proposed system significantly improves IoT communication performance by over 20%, under harsh sea conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13618v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CARPE: Context-Aware Image Representation Prioritization via Ensemble for Large Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13622</link><description>arXiv:2601.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have pushed them closer to becoming general-purpose assistants. Despite their strong performance, LVLMs still struggle with vision-centric tasks such as image classification, underperforming compared to their base vision encoders, which are often CLIP-based models. To address this limitation, we propose Context-Aware Image Representation Prioritization via Ensemble (CARPE), a novel, model-agnostic framework which introduces vision-integration layers and a context-aware ensemble strategy to identify when to prioritize image representations or rely on the reasoning capabilities of the language model. This design enhances the model's ability to adaptively weight visual and textual modalities and enables the model to capture various aspects of image representations, leading to consistent improvements in generalization across classification and vision-language benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARPE not only improves performance on image classification benchmarks but also enhances results across various vision-language benchmarks. Finally, CARPE is designed to be effectively integrated with most open-source LVLMs that consist of a vision encoder and a language model, ensuring its adaptability across diverse architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13622v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PRIMAL: Processing-In-Memory Based Low-Rank Adaptation for LLM Inference Accelerator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13628</link><description>arXiv:2601.13628v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed over knowledge bases for efficient knowledge retrieval and question answering. However, LLMs can inadvertently answer beyond a user's permission scope, leaking sensitive content, thus making it difficult to deploy knowledge-base QA under fine-grained access control requirements. In this work, we identify a geometric regularity in intermediate activations: for the same query, representations induced by different permission scopes cluster distinctly and are readily separable. Building on this separability, we propose Activation-space Anchored Access Control (AAAC), a training-free framework for multi-class permission control. AAAC constructs an anchor bank, with one permission anchor per class, from a small offline sample set and requires no fine-tuning. At inference time, a multi-anchor steering mechanism redirects each query's activations toward the anchor-defined authorized region associated with the current user, thereby suppressing over-privileged generations by design. Finally, extensive experiments across three LLM families demonstrate that AAAC reduces permission violation rates by up to 86.5% and prompt-based attack success rates by 90.7%, while improving response usability with minor inference overhead compared to baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13630v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ContiguousKV: Accelerating LLM Prefill with Granularity-Aligned KV Cache Management</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13631</link><description>arXiv:2601.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently serving Large Language Models (LLMs) with persistent Prefix Key-Value (KV) Cache is critical for applications like conversational search and multi-turn dialogue. Serving a request requires loading the pre-computed prefix KV cache and generating the first token, defined as the Re-Prefill Phase. Offloading this shared prefix cache to secondary storage is essential for memory scalability. Re-Prefill with offloading suffers from severe I/O bottlenecks in two aspects. First, semantic-aware KV cache pruning algorithms select important tokens in fine granularity, while systems manage I/O in coarse, fixed-size blocks, causing severe read amplification. Second, the sequential dependency between identifying important tokens and loading KV cache creates idle I/O and compute bubbles, under-utilizing system resources.
  This paper proposes \textit{ContiguousKV}, a high-performance prefix KV cache offloading system that bridges algorithmic semantics with I/O efficiency to accelerate the Re-Prefill phase. We first introduce \textit{ContiguousChunk}, a unified data management granularity that aligns KV cache pruning with I/O operations. All the mechanisms critical for I/O performance are performed at the granularity of ContiguousChunk, thereby eliminating read amplification. By exploiting the high similarity in important ContiguousChunk indices across layers, we propose intra- and inter-period asynchronous prefetching to break the sequential dependency between I/O and compute, effectively eliminating idle bubbles. Finally, we propose attention-guided cache management to retain semantically critical prefix data in memory. Evaluations on Qwen2.5 series models show that ContiguousKV achieves a 3.85x speedup in the Re-Prefill phase over the state-of-the-art offloading system IMPRESS, while maintaining high output quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13631v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Resilient Routing: Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing in Smart Logistics via Spatiotemporal Graph Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13632</link><description>arXiv:2601.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the e-commerce industry, the logistics network is experiencing unprecedented pressure. The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%. This empirical evidence confirms that the proposed data-driven approach can effectively balance delivery efficiency and operational safety.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13632v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Test-time Inference for Visual Grounding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13633</link><description>arXiv:2601.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual grounding is an essential capability of Visual Language Models (VLMs) to understand the real physical world. Previous state-of-the-art grounding visual language models usually have large model sizes, making them heavy for deployment and slow for inference. However, we notice that the sizes of visual encoders are nearly the same for small and large VLMs and the major difference is the sizes of the language models. Small VLMs fall behind larger VLMs in grounding because of the difference in language understanding capability rather than visual information handling. To mitigate the gap, we introduce 'Efficient visual Grounding language Models' (EGM): a method to scale the test-time computation (#generated tokens). Scaling the test-time computation of a small model is deployment-friendly, and yields better end-to-end latency as the cost of each token is much cheaper compared to directly running a large model. On the RefCOCO benchmark, our EGM-Qwen3-VL-8B demonstrates 91.4 IoU with an average of 737ms (5.9x faster) latency while Qwen3-VL-235B demands 4,320ms to achieve 90.5 IoU. To validate our approach's generality, we further set up a new amodal grounding setting that requires the model to predict both the visible and occluded parts of the objects. Experiments show our method can consistently and significantly improve the vanilla grounding and amodal grounding capabilities of small models to be on par with or outperform the larger models, thereby improving the efficiency for visual grounding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13633v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Direct Finite-Time Contraction (Step-Log) Profiling--Driven Optimization of Parallel Schemes for Nonlinear Problems on Multicore Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13637</link><description>arXiv:2601.13637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient computation of all distinct solutions of nonlinear problems is essential in many scientific and engineering applications. Although high-order parallel iterative schemes offer fast convergence, their practical performance is often limited by sensitivity to internal parameters and the lack of reproducible tuning procedures. Classical parameter selection tools based on analytical conditions and dynamical-system diagnostics can be problem-dependent and computationally demanding, which motivates lightweight data-driven alternatives.
  In this study, we propose a parameterized single-step bi-parametric parallel Weierstrass-type scheme with third-order convergence together with a training-free tuning framework based on Direct finite-time contraction (step-log) profiling. The approach extracts Lyapunov-like finite-time contraction information directly from solver trajectories via step norms and step-log ratios, aggregates the resulting profiles over micro-launch ensembles, and ranks parameter candidates using two compact scores: the stability minimum S_min and the stability moment S_mom. Numerical results demonstrate consistent improvements in convergence rate, stability, and robustness across diverse nonlinear test problems, establishing the proposed profiling-based strategy as an efficient and reproducible alternative to classical parameter tuning methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13637v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A General One-Shot Multimodal Active Perception Framework for Robotic Manipulation: Learning to Predict Optimal Viewpoint</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13639</link><description>arXiv:2601.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active perception in vision-based robotic manipulation aims to move the camera toward more informative observation viewpoints, thereby providing high-quality perceptual inputs for downstream tasks. Most existing active perception methods rely on iterative optimization, leading to high time and motion costs, and are tightly coupled with task-specific objectives, which limits their transferability. In this paper, we propose a general one-shot multimodal active perception framework for robotic manipulation. The framework enables direct inference of optimal viewpoints and comprises a data collection pipeline and an optimal viewpoint prediction network. Specifically, the framework decouples viewpoint quality evaluation from the overall architecture, supporting heterogeneous task requirements. Optimal viewpoints are defined through systematic sampling and evaluation of candidate viewpoints, after which large-scale training datasets are constructed via domain randomization. Moreover, a multimodal optimal viewpoint prediction network is developed, leveraging cross-attention to align and fuse multimodal features and directly predict camera pose adjustments. The proposed framework is instantiated in robotic grasping under viewpoint-constrained environments. Experimental results demonstrate that active perception guided by the framework significantly improves grasp success rates. Notably, real-world evaluations achieve nearly double the grasp success rate and enable seamless sim-to-real transfer without additional fine-tuning, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13639v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quadratic Upper Bound for Boosting Robustness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13645</link><description>arXiv:2601.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast adversarial training (FAT) aims to enhance the robustness of models against adversarial attacks with reduced training time, however, FAT often suffers from compromised robustness due to insufficient exploration of adversarial space. In this paper, we develop a loss function to mitigate the problem of degraded robustness under FAT. Specifically, we derive a quadratic upper bound (QUB) on the adversarial training (AT) loss function and propose to utilize the bound with existing FAT methods. Our experimental results show that applying QUB loss to the existing methods yields significant improvement of robustness. Furthermore, using various metrics, we demonstrate that this improvement is likely to result from the smoothened loss landscape of the resulting model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13645v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fusion Segment Transformer: Bi-Directional Attention Guided Fusion Network for AI-Generated Music Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13647</link><description>arXiv:2601.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of generative AI technology, anyone can now easily create and deploy AI-generated music, which has heightened the need for technical solutions to address copyright and ownership issues.

As in our previous work, we extract content embeddings from short music segments using diverse feature extractors. Furthermore, we enhance the architecture for full-audio AI-generated music detection by introducing a Gated Fusion Layer that effectively integrates content and structural information, enabling the capture of long-term context. Experiments on the SONICS and AIME datasets show that our approach outperforms the previous model and recent baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in AI-generated music detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fairness or Fluency?

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incentivized the development of LLM-as-a-judge, an application of LLMs where they are used as judges to decide the quality of a certain piece of text given a certain context. However, previous studies have demonstrated that LLM-as-a-judge can be biased towards different aspects of the judged texts, which often do not align with human preference. One of the identified biases is language bias, which indicates that the decision of LLM-as-a-judge can differ based on the language of the judged texts. In this paper, we study two types of language bias in pairwise LLM-as-a-judge: (1) performance disparity between languages when the judge is prompted to compare options from the same language, and (2) bias towards options written in major languages when the judge is prompted to compare options of two different languages. We find that for same-language judging, there exist significant performance disparities across language families, with European languages consistently outperforming African languages, and this bias is more pronounced in culturally-related subjects. For inter-language judging, we observe that most models favor English answers, and that this preference is influenced more by answer language than question language. Finally, we investigate whether language bias is in fact caused by low-perplexity bias, a previously identified bias of LLM-as-a-judge, and we find that while perplexity is slightly correlated with language bias, language bias cannot be fully explained by perplexity only.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13649v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Face-Voice Association with Inductive Bias for Maximum Class Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13651</link><description>arXiv:2601.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face-voice association is widely studied in multimodal learning and is approached representing faces and voices with embeddings that are close for a same person and well separated from those of others. Previous work achieved this with loss functions. Recent advancements in classification have shown that the discriminative ability of embeddings can be strengthened by imposing maximum class separation as inductive bias. This technique has never been used in the domain of face-voice association, and this work aims at filling this gap. More specifically, we develop a method for face-voice association that imposes maximum class separation among multimodal representations of different speakers as an inductive bias. Through quantitative experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it achieves SOTA performance on two task formulation of face-voice association. Furthermore, we carry out an ablation study to show that imposing inductive bias is most effective when combined with losses for inter-class orthogonality. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that applies and demonstrates the effectiveness of maximum class separation as an inductive bias in multimodal learning; it hence paves the way to establish a new paradigm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13651v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TimeART: Towards Agentic Time Series Reasoning via Tool-Augmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13653</link><description>arXiv:2601.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data widely exist in real-world cyber-physical systems. Though analyzing and interpreting them contributes to significant values, e.g, disaster prediction and financial risk control, current workflows mainly rely on human data scientists, which requires significant labor costs and lacks automation. To tackle this, we introduce TimeART, a framework fusing the analytical capability of strong out-of-the-box tools and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which serves as a fully agentic data scientist for Time Series Question Answering (TSQA). To teach the LLM-based Time Series Reasoning Models (TSRMs) strategic tool-use, we also collect a 100k expert trajectory corpus called TimeToolBench. To enhance TSRMs' generalization capability, we then devise a four-stage training strategy, which boosts TSRMs through learning from their own early experiences and self-reflections. Experimentally, we train an 8B TSRM on TimeToolBench and equip it with the TimeART framework, and it achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on multiple TSQA tasks, which pioneers a novel approach towards agentic time series reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Does the LLM Stop Computing: An Empirical Study of User-Reported Failures in Open-Source LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13655</link><description>arXiv:2601.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The democratization of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) allows users to fine-tune and deploy models on local infrastructure but exposes them to a First Mile deployment landscape. Unlike black-box API consumption, the reliability of user-managed orchestration remains a critical blind spot. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 705 real-world failures from the open-source DeepSeek, Llama, and Qwen ecosystems.
  Our analysis reveals a paradigm shift: white-box orchestration relocates the reliability bottleneck from model algorithmic defects to the systemic fragility of the deployment stack. We identify three key phenomena: (1) Diagnostic Divergence: runtime crashes distinctively signal infrastructure friction, whereas incorrect functionality serves as a signature for internal tokenizer defects. (2) Systemic Homogeneity: Root causes converge across divergent series, confirming reliability barriers are inherent to the shared ecosystem rather than specific architectures. (3) Lifecycle Escalation: Barriers escalate from intrinsic configuration struggles during fine-tuning to compounded environmental incompatibilities during inference. Supported by our publicly available dataset, these insights provide actionable guidance for enhancing the reliability of the LLM landscape.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13655v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Known Facts: Generating Unseen Temporal Knowledge to Address Data Contamination in LLM Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13658</link><description>arXiv:2601.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic extraction of information is important for populating large web knowledge bases such as Wikidata. The temporal version of that task, temporal knowledge graph extraction (TKGE), involves extracting temporally grounded facts from text, represented as semantic quadruples (subject, relation, object, timestamp). Many recent systems take advantage of large language models (LLMs), which are becoming a new cornerstone of the web due to their performance on many tasks across the natural language processing (NLP) field. Despite the importance of TKGE, existing datasets for training and evaluation remain scarce, and contamination of evaluation data is an unaddressed issue, potentially inflating LLMs' perceived performance due to overlaps between training and evaluation sets. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel synthetic evaluation dataset constructed from predicted future, previously unseen temporal facts, thereby eliminating contamination and enabling robust and unbiased benchmarking. Our dataset creation involves a two-step approach: (1) Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting (TKGF) generates plausible future quadruples, which are subsequently filtered to adhere to the original knowledge base schema; (2) LLMs perform quadruple-to-text generation, creating semantically aligned textual descriptions. We benchmark Extract, Define and Canonicalize (EDC), a state-of-the-art LLM-based extraction framework, demonstrating that LLM performance decreases when evaluated on our dataset compared to a dataset of known facts. We publicly release our dataset consisting of 4.2K future quadruples and corresponding textual descriptions, along with the generation methodology, enabling continuous creation of unlimited future temporal datasets to serve as long-term, contamination-free benchmarks for TKGE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13658v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act: Disentangled Representation Learning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13659</link><description>arXiv:2601.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis integrates Linguistic, Visual, and Acoustic. Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling. This ignores spatiotemporal heterogeneity, leading to spatiotemporal information asymmetry and thus limited performance. Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts.

Abstract: The proliferation of large-scale low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations is driving the need for intelligent routing strategies that can effectively deliver data to terrestrial networks under rapidly time-varying topologies and intermittent gateway visibility. Leveraging the global control capabilities of a geostationary (GEO)-resident software-defined networking (SDN) controller, we introduce opportunistic routing, which aims to minimize delivery delay by forwarding packets to any currently available ground gateways rather than fixed destinations. This makes it a promising approach for achieving low-latency and robust data delivery in highly dynamic LEO networks. Specifically, we formulate a constrained stochastic optimization problem and employ a residual reinforcement learning framework to optimize opportunistic routing for reducing transmission delay. Simulation results over multiple days of orbital data demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in queue length reduction compared to classical backpressure and other well-known queueing algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the stability, complexity, and distribution of similarity classes of the longest edge bisection process for triangles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13663</link><description>arXiv:2601.13663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Longest Edge Bisection (LEB) of a triangle is performed by joining the midpoint of its longest edge to the opposite vertex. Applying this procedure iteratively produces an infinite family of triangles. Surprisingly, a classical result of Adler (1983) shows that for any initial triangle, this infinite family falls into finitely many similarity classes.
  While the set of classes is finite, we show that a far smaller, stable subset of ``fat'' triangles, called {\bf terminal quadruples}, effectively dominates the final mesh structure. We prove the following asymptotic area distribution result: for every initial triangle, the portion of area occupied by terminal quadruples tends to one, with the convergence occurring at an exponential rate. In fact, we provide the precise distribution of triangles in every step. We introduce the {\bf bisection graph} and use spectral methods to establish this result.
  Given this dominance, we provide a complete characterization of triangles possessing a single terminal quadruple, while conversely exhibiting a sequence of triangles with an unbounded number of terminal quadruples. Furthermore, we reveal several fundamental geometric properties of the points of a terminal quadruple, laying the groundwork for studying the geometric distribution of the entire orbit. Our analysis leverages the hyperbolic geometry framework of Perdomo and Plaza (2014) and refines their techniques.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13663v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VIAFormer: Voxel-Image Alignment Transformer for High-Fidelity Voxel Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13664</link><description>arXiv:2601.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose VIAFormer, a Voxel-Image Alignment Transformer model designed for Multi-view Conditioned Voxel Refinement--the task of repairing incomplete noisy voxels using calibrated multi-view images as guidance. Its effectiveness stems from a synergistic design: an Image Index that provides explicit 3D spatial grounding for 2D image tokens, a Correctional Flow objective that learns a direct voxel-refinement trajectory, and a Hybrid Stream Transformer that enables robust cross-modal fusion. Experiments show that VIAFormer establishes a new state of the art in correcting both severe synthetic corruptions and realistic artifacts on the voxel shape obtained from powerful Vision Foundation Models.

Abstract: Food wastage is one of the critical challenges in the agricultural supply chain, and accurate and effective spoilage detection can help to reduce it. Further, it is highly important to forecast the spoilage information. This aids the longevity of the supply chain management in the agriculture field. This motivated us to propose fusion based architectures by combining CNN with LSTM and DeiT transformer for the following multi-tasks simultaneously: (i) vegetable classification, (ii) food spoilage detection, and (iii) shelf life forecasting. We developed a dataset by capturing images of vegetables from their fresh state until they were completely spoiled. From the experimental analysis it is concluded that the proposed fusion architectures CNN+CNN-LSTM and CNN+DeiT Transformer outperformed several deep learning models such as CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, Capsule Networks, and DeiT Transformers. Overall, CNN + DeiT Transformer yielded F1-score of 0.98 and 0.61 in vegetable classification and spoilage detection respectively and mean squared error (MSE) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 3.58, and 41.66% respectively in spoilage forecasting. Further, the reliability of the fusion models was validated on noisy images and integrated with LIME to visualize the model decisions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13665v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CommunityBench: Benchmarking Community-Level Alignment across Diverse Groups and Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13669</link><description>arXiv:2601.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) alignment ensures model behaviors reflect human value. Existing alignment strategies primarily follow two paths: one assumes a universal value set for a unified goal (i.e., one-size-fits-all), while the other treats every individual as unique to customize models (i.e., individual-level). However, assuming a monolithic value space marginalizes minority norms, while tailoring individual models is prohibitively expensive. Recognizing that human society is organized into social clusters with high intra-group value alignment, we propose community-level alignment as a "middle ground". Practically, we introduce CommunityBench, the first large-scale benchmark for community-level alignment evaluation, featuring four tasks grounded in Common Identity and Common Bond theory. With CommunityBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various foundation models on CommunityBench, revealing that current LLMs exhibit limited capacity to model community-specific preferences. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of community-level alignment in facilitating individual modeling, providing a promising direction for scalable and pluralistic alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13669v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Orchestration of Multi-Agent Systems: Architectures, Protocols, and Enterprise Adoption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13671</link><description>arXiv:2601.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orchestrated multi-agent systems represent the next stage in the evolution of artificial intelligence, where autonomous agents collaborate through structured coordination and communication to achieve complex, shared objectives. This paper consolidates and formalizes the technical composition of such systems, presenting a unified architectural framework that integrates planning, policy enforcement, state management, and quality operations into a coherent orchestration layer. Another primary contribution of this work is the in-depth technical delineation of two complementary communication protocols - the Model Context Protocol, which standardizes how agents access external tools and contextual data, and the Agent2Agent protocol, which governs peer coordination, negotiation, and delegation. Together, these protocols establish an interoperable communication substrate that enables scalable, auditable, and policy-compliant reasoning across distributed agent collectives. Beyond protocol design, the paper details how orchestration logic, governance frameworks, and observability mechanisms collectively sustain system coherence, transparency, and accountability. By synthesizing these elements into a cohesive technical blueprint, this paper provides comprehensive treatments of orchestrated multi-agent systems - bridging conceptual architectures with implementation-ready design principles for enterprise-scale AI ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13671v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autoregressive deep learning for real-time simulation of soft tissue dynamics during virtual neurosurgery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13676</link><description>arXiv:2601.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of brain deformation is a key component for developing realistic, interactive neurosurgical simulators, as complex nonlinear deformations must be captured to ensure realistic tool-tissue interactions. However, traditional numerical solvers often fall short in meeting real-time performance requirements. To overcome this, we introduce a deep learning-based surrogate model that efficiently simulates transient brain deformation caused by continuous interactions between surgical instruments and the virtual brain geometry. Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm. We further integrate the trained surrogate model into an interactive neurosurgical simulation environment, achieving runtimes below 10 ms per simulation step on consumer-grade inference hardware. Our proposed deep learning framework enables rapid, smooth and accurate biomechanical simulations of dynamic brain tissue deformation, laying the foundation for realistic surgical training environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13676v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finally Outshining the Random Baseline: A Simple and Effective Solution for Active Learning in 3D Biomedical Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13677</link><description>arXiv:2601.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) has the potential to drastically reduce annotation costs in 3D biomedical image segmentation, where expert labeling of volumetric data is both time-consuming and expensive. Yet, existing AL methods are unable to consistently outperform improved random sampling baselines adapted to 3D data, leaving the field without a reliable solution. We introduce Class-stratified Scheduled Power Predictive Entropy (ClaSP PE), a simple and effective query strategy that addresses two key limitations of standard uncertainty-based AL methods: class imbalance and redundancy in early selections. ClaSP PE combines class-stratified querying to ensure coverage of underrepresented structures and log-scale power noising with a decaying schedule to enforce query diversity in early-stage AL and encourage exploitation later. In our evaluation on 24 experimental settings using four 3D biomedical datasets within the comprehensive nnActive benchmark, ClaSP PE is the only method that generally outperforms improved random baselines in terms of both segmentation quality with statistically significant gains, whilst remaining annotation efficient. Furthermore, we explicitly simulate the real-world application by testing our method on four previously unseen datasets without manual adaptation, where all experiment parameters are set according to predefined guidelines. The results confirm that ClaSP PE robustly generalizes to novel tasks without requiring dataset-specific tuning. Within the nnActive framework, we present compelling evidence that an AL method can consistently outperform random baselines adapted to 3D segmentation, in terms of both performance and annotation efficiency in a realistic, close-to-production scenario. Our open-source implementation and clear deployment guidelines make it readily applicable in practice.

Abstract: The Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) integrates numerous software components in a cloud-like deployment, opening the radio access network to previously unconsidered security threats. With the ever-evolving threat landscape, integrating security practices through a DevSecOps approach is essential for fast and secure releases. Current vulnerability assessment practices often rely on manual, labor-intensive, and subjective investigations, leading to inconsistencies in the threat analysis. To mitigate these issues, we establish an automated pipeline that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to minimize human intervention and associated biases. By mapping real-world vulnerabilities to predefined threat lists with a standardized input format, our approach is the first to enable iterative, quantitative, and efficient assessments, generating reliable threat scores for both individual vulnerabilities and entire system components within O-RAN. We illustrate the effectiveness of our framework through an example implementation for O-RAN, showcasing how continuous security testing can integrate into automated testing pipelines to address the unique security challenges of this paradigm shift in telecommunications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13681v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CodeContests-O: Powering LLMs via Feedback-Driven Iterative Test Case Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13682</link><description>arXiv:2601.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of reasoning models necessitates large-scale verifiable data, for which programming tasks serve as an ideal source. However, while competitive programming platforms provide abundant problems and solutions, high-quality test cases for verification remain scarce. Existing approaches attempt to synthesize test cases using Large Language Models (LLMs), but rely solely on the model's intrinsic generation capabilities without external feedback, frequently resulting in insufficiently diverse cases. To address this limitation, we propose a $\textbf{Feedback-Driven Iterative Framework}$ for comprehensive test case construction. Specifically, our method leverages the LLM to generate initial test cases, executes them against known correct and incorrect solutions, and utilizes the failed results as feedback to guide the LLM in refining the test cases toward high fidelity and discriminability. We then apply this method to the CodeContests dataset to construct an optimized high-quality derivative, $\textbf{CodeContests-O}$. Evaluating against the entire pool of solutions ($1.1 \times 10^7$ in total), our dataset achieves an average True Positive Rate (TPR) of $89.37\%$ and True Negative Rate (TNR) of $90.89\%$, significantly outperforming the CodeContests and CodeContests+ by margins of $4.32\%$ and $9.37\%$, respectively. Furthermore, fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-7B model on CodeContests-O results in a $9.52\%$ improvement on LiveCodeBench (Pass@1). Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the quality of CodeContests-O.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) have emerged as a powerful architecture for high-fidelity image generation, yet the quadratic cost of self-attention poses a major scalability bottleneck. To address this, linear attention mechanisms have been adopted to reduce computational cost; unfortunately, the resulting linear diffusion transformers (LiTs) models often come at the expense of generative performance, frequently producing over-smoothed attention weights that limit expressiveness. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Differential Linear Attention (DyDiLA), a novel linear attention formulation that enhances the effectiveness of LiTs by mitigating the oversmoothing issue and improving generation quality. Specifically, the novelty of DyDiLA lies in three key designs: (i) dynamic projection module, which facilitates the decoupling of token representations by learning with dynamically assigned knowledge; (ii) dynamic measure kernel, which provides a better similarity measurement to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between tokens by dynamically assigning kernel functions for token processing; and (iii) token differential operator, which enables more robust query-to-key retrieval by calculating the differences between the tokens and their corresponding information redundancy produced by dynamic measure kernel. To capitalize on DyDiLA, we introduce a refined LiT, termed DyDi-LiT, that systematically incorporates our advancements. Extensive experiments show that DyDi-LiT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple metrics, underscoring its strong practical potential.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HeteroCache: A Dynamic Retrieval Approach to Heterogeneous KV Cache Compression for Long-Context LLM Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13684</link><description>arXiv:2601.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear memory growth of the KV cache poses a significant bottleneck for LLM inference in long-context tasks. Existing static compression methods often fail to preserve globally important information, principally because they overlook the attention drift phenomenon where token significance evolves dynamically. Although recent dynamic retrieval approaches attempt to address this issue, they typically suffer from coarse-grained caching strategies and incur high I/O overhead due to frequent data transfers. To overcome these limitations, we propose HeteroCache, a training-free dynamic compression framework. Our method is built on two key insights: attention heads exhibit diverse temporal heterogeneity, and there is significant spatial redundancy among heads within the same layer. Guided by these insights, HeteroCache categorizes heads based on stability and redundancy. Consequently, we apply a fine-grained weighting strategy that allocates larger cache budgets to heads with rapidly shifting attention to capture context changes, thereby addressing the inefficiency of coarse-grained strategies. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical storage mechanism in which a subset of representative heads monitors attention shift, and trigger an asynchronous, on-demand retrieval of contexts from the CPU, effectively hiding I/O latency. Finally, experiments demonstrate that HeteroCache achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-context benchmarks and accelerates decoding by up to $3\times$ compared to the original model in the 224K context. Our code will be open-source.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13684v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Mental States to Guide Social Influence in Multi-Person Group Dialogue</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13687</link><description>arXiv:2601.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing dynamic Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks mostly place language models in a passive role: the model reads a sequence of connected scenarios and reports what people believe, feel, intend, and do as these states change. In real social interaction, ToM is also used for action: a speaker plans what to say in order to shift another person's mental-state trajectory toward a goal. We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants. SocialMindChange also includes selected higher-order states. Using a structured four-step framework, we construct 1,200 social contexts, covering 6000 scenarios and over 90,000 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Evaluations on ten state-of-the-art LLMs show that their average performance is 54.2% below human performance. This gap suggests that current LLMs still struggle to maintain and change mental-state representations across long, linked interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13687v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dr. Assistant: Enhancing Clinical Diagnostic Inquiry via Structured Diagnostic Reasoning Data and Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13690</link><description>arXiv:2601.13690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) provide reasoning and inquiry guidance for physicians, yet they face notable challenges, including high maintenance costs and low generalization capability. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in healthcare due to their extensive knowledge reserves, retrieval, and communication capabilities. While LLMs show promise and excel at medical benchmarks, their diagnostic reasoning and inquiry skills are constrained. To mitigate this issue, we propose (1) Clinical Diagnostic Reasoning Data (CDRD) structure to capture abstract clinical reasoning logic, and a pipeline for its construction, and (2) the Dr. Assistant, a clinical diagnostic model equipped with clinical reasoning and inquiry skills. Its training involves a two-stage process: SFT, followed by RL with a tailored reward function. We also introduce a benchmark to evaluate both diagnostic reasoning and inquiry. Our experiments demonstrate that the Dr. Assistant outperforms open-source models and achieves competitive performance to closed-source models, providing an effective solution for clinical diagnostic inquiry guidance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13690v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Intent Prediction Agentic AI empowered Edge Service Function Chain Orchestration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13694</link><description>arXiv:2601.13694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), Agentic AI (AAI) based on large language models (LLMs) is gradually being applied to network management. However, in edge network environments, high user mobility and implicit service intents pose significant challenges to the passive and reactive management of traditional AAI. To address the limitations of existing approaches in handling dynamic demands and predicting users' implicit intents, in this paper we propose an edge service function chain (SFC) orchestration framework empowered by a Generative Intent Prediction Agent (GIPA). Our GIPA aims to shift the paradigm from passive execution to proactive prediction and orchestration. First, we construct a multidimensional intent space that includes functional preferences, QoS sensitivity, and resource requirements, enabling the mapping from unstructured natural language to quantifiable physical resource demands. Second, to cope with the complexity and randomness of intent sequences, we design an intent prediction model based on a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM), which reconstructs users' implicit intents from multidimensional context through a reverse denoising process. Finally, the predicted implicit intents are embedded as global prompts into the SFC orchestration model to guide the network in proactively and ahead-of-time optimizing SFC deployment strategies. Experiment results show that GIPA outperforms existing baseline methods in highly concurrent and highly dynamic scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OptiSQL: Executable SQL Generation from Optical TokensOptiSQL: Executable SQL Generation from Optical Tokens</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13695</link><description>arXiv:2601.13695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Executable SQL generation is typically studied in text-to-SQL settings, where tables are provided as fully linearized textual schemas and contents. While effective, this formulation assumes access to structured text and incurs substantial token overhead, which is misaligned with many real-world scenarios where tables appear as visual artifacts in documents or webpages. We investigate whether compact optical representations can serve as an efficient interface for executable semantic parsing. We present OptiSQL, a vision-driven framework that generates executable SQL directly from table images and natural language questions using compact optical tokens. OptiSQL leverages an OCR-oriented visual encoder to compress table structure and content into a small set of optical tokens and fine-tunes a pretrained decoder for SQL generation while freezing the encoder to isolate representation sufficiency. Experiments on a visualized version of Spider 2.0-Snow show that OptiSQL retains strong execution accuracy while reducing table input tokens by an order of magnitude. Robustness analyses further demonstrate that optical tokens preserve essential structural information under visual perturbations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13695v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty-Aware Gradient Signal-to-Noise Data Selection for Instruction Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13697</link><description>arXiv:2601.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is a standard paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs), but modern instruction datasets are large, noisy, and redundant, making full-data fine-tuning costly and often unnecessary. Existing data selection methods either build expensive gradient datastores or assign static scores from a weak proxy, largely ignoring evolving uncertainty, and thus missing a key source of LLM interpretability. We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13697v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Does Privacy Always Harm Fairness?

Abstract: Fairness and privacy are two vital pillars of trustworthy machine learning. Despite extensive research on these individual topics, the relationship between fairness and privacy has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we utilize the information-theoretic measure Chernoff Information to highlight the data-dependent nature of the relationship among the triad of fairness, privacy, and accuracy. We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications. Additionally, we show that Noisy Chernoff Difference acts as a proxy for the steepness of the fairness-accuracy curves. Finally, we propose a method for estimating Chernoff Information on data from unknown distributions and utilize this framework to examine the triad dynamic on real datasets. This work builds towards a unified understanding of the fairness-privacy-accuracy relationship and highlights its data-dependent nature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13698v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DistilMOS: Layer-Wise Self-Distillation For Self-Supervised Learning Model-Based MOS Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13700</link><description>arXiv:2601.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of self-supervised learning (SSL), fine-tuning pretrained SSL models for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, during fine-tuning, these SSL-based MOS prediction models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of the pretrained knowledge and tend to overfit the training set, resulting in poor generalization performance. In this study, we propose DistilMOS, a novel method that learns to predict not only MOS but also token IDs obtained by clustering the hidden representations of each layer in the pretrained SSL model. These layer-wise token targets serve as self-distillation signals that enables the MOS prediction model to extract rich internal knowledge from SSL models, enhancing both prediction accuracy and generalization capability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms standard SSL-based MOS prediction models on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, verifying the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13700v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IGAA: Intent-Driven General Agentic AI for Edge Services Scheduling using Generative Meta Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13702</link><description>arXiv:2601.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI (AAI), which extends Large Language Models with enhanced reasoning capabilities, has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous edge service scheduling. However, user mobility creates highly dynamic service demands in edge networks, and existing service scheduling agents often lack generalization capabilities for new scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Intent-Driven General Agentic AI (IGAA) framework. Leveraging a meta-learning paradigm, IGAA enables AAI to continuously learn from prior service scheduling experiences to achieve generalized scheduling capabilities. Particularly, IGAA incorporates three core mechanisms. First, we design a Network-Service-Intent matrix mapping method to allow agents to simulate novel scenarios and generate training datasets. Second, we present an easy-to-hard generalization learning scheme with two customized algorithms, namely Resource Causal Effect-aware Transfer Learning (RCETL) and Action Potential Optimality-aware Transfer Learning (APOTL). These algorithms help IGAA adapt to new scenarios. Furthermore, to prevent catastrophic forgetting during continual IGAA learning, we propose a Generative Intent Replay (GIR) mechanism that synthesizes historical service data to consolidate prior capabilities. Finally, to mitigate the effect of LLM hallucinations on scenario simulation, we incorporate a scenario evaluation and correction model to guide agents in generating rational scenarios and datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate IGAA's strong generalization and scalability. Specifically, IGAA enables rapid adaptation by transferring learned policies to analogous new ones, such as applying latency-sensitive patterns from real-time computing to optimize novel Internet of Vehicles (IoV) services. Compared to scenario-specific methods, IGAA maintains the intent-satisfaction rate gap within 3.81%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13702v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Performance and Complexity Trade-off Optimization of Speech Models During Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13704</link><description>arXiv:2601.13704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In speech machine learning, neural network models are typically designed by choosing an architecture with fixed layer sizes and structure. These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing. The code related to our work is publicly available to encourage further research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning or Pattern Matching? Probing Large Vision-Language Models with Visual Puzzles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13705</link><description>arXiv:2601.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Puzzles have long served as compact and revealing probes of human cognition, isolating abstraction, rule discovery, and systematic reasoning with minimal reliance on prior knowledge. Leveraging these properties, visual puzzles have recently emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool for evaluating the reasoning abilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), offering controlled, verifiable alternatives to open-ended multimodal benchmarks. This survey provides a unified perspective of visual puzzle reasoning in LVLMs. We frame visual puzzles through a common abstraction and organize existing benchmarks by the reasoning mechanisms they target (inductive, analogical, algorithmic, deductive, and geometric/spatial), thereby linking puzzle design to the cognitive operations required for solving. Synthesizing empirical evidence across these categories, we identify consistent limitations in current models, including brittle generalization, tight entanglement between perception and reasoning, and a persistent gap between fluent explanations and faithful execution. By framing visual puzzles as diagnostic instruments rather than task formats, this survey elaborates on the state of LVLM reasoning and outlines key directions for future benchmarks and reasoning-aware multimodal systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ParkingTwin: Training-Free Streaming 3D Reconstruction for Parking-Lot Digital Twins</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13706</link><description>arXiv:2601.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity parking-lot digital twins provide essential priors for path planning, collision checking, and perception validation in Automated Valet Parking (AVP). Yet robot-oriented reconstruction faces a trilemma: sparse forward-facing views cause weak parallax and ill-posed geometry; dynamic occlusions and extreme lighting hinder stable texture fusion; and neural rendering typically needs expensive offline optimization, violating edge-side streaming constraints. We propose ParkingTwin, a training-free, lightweight system for online streaming 3D reconstruction. First, OSM-prior-driven geometric construction uses OpenStreetMap semantic topology to directly generate a metric-consistent TSDF, replacing blind geometric search with deterministic mapping and avoiding costly optimization. Second, geometry-aware dynamic filtering employs a quad-modal constraint field (normal/height/depth consistency) to reject moving vehicles and transient occlusions in real time. Third, illumination-robust fusion in CIELAB decouples luminance and chromaticity via adaptive L-channel weighting and depth-gradient suppression, reducing seams under abrupt lighting changes. ParkingTwin runs at 30+ FPS on an entry-level GTX 1660. On a 68,000 m^2 real-world dataset, it achieves SSIM 0.87 (+16.0%), delivers about 15x end-to-end speedup, and reduces GPU memory by 83.3% compared with state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that typically requires high-end GPUs (RTX 4090D). The system outputs explicit triangle meshes compatible with Unity/Unreal digital-twin pipelines.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often arise when language priors dominate over visual evidence, causing object misidentification and visually inconsistent descriptions. We address this issue by framing hallucination mitigation as contrastive guidance, steering generation toward visually grounded and semantically faithful text. This approach regulates the model's internal behavior by reducing over-dependence on language priors and contrasting visually grounded with language-only representations. We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions. Experiments on the CHAIR and POPE benchmarks show that ACG achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness and caption quality while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method establishes a principled and efficient alternative, reducing latency by up to 2x compared to prior contrastive decoding methods that require multiple forward passes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13707v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hidden in Plain Text: Measuring LLM Deception Quality Against Human Baselines Using Social Deduction Games</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13709</link><description>arXiv:2601.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly used in many applications, raising concerns about their safety. While previous work has shown that LLMs can deceive in controlled tasks, less is known about their ability to deceive using natural language in social contexts. In this paper, we study deception in the Social Deduction Game (SDG) Mafia, where success is dependent on deceiving others through conversation. Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research. Our findings underscore both the sophistication and risks of LLM deception in social contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13709v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Should Have Surgery?

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has reshaped medical imaging, yet the use of AI on clinical data for prospective decision support remains limited. We study pre-operative prediction of clinically meaningful improvement in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), defining success as a more than 8.9-point reduction in SNOT-22 at 6 months (MCID). In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting. Notably, GenAI justifications align with clinician heuristics and the MLP's feature importance, repeatedly highlighting baseline SNOT-22, CT/endoscopy severity, polyp phenotype, and physchology/pain comorbidities. We provide a reproducible tabular-to-GenAI evaluation protocol and subgroup analyses. Findings support an ML-first, GenAI- augmented workflow: deploy calibrated ML for primary triage of surgical candidacy, with GenAI as an explainer to enhance transparency and shared decision-making.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GerAV: Towards New Heights in German Authorship Verification using Fine-Tuned LLMs on a New Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13711</link><description>arXiv:2601.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorship verification (AV) is the task of determining whether two texts were written by the same author and has been studied extensively, predominantly for English data. In contrast, large-scale benchmarks and systematic evaluations for other languages remain scarce. We address this gap by introducing GerAV, a comprehensive benchmark for German AV comprising over 600k labeled text pairs. GerAV is built from Twitter and Reddit data, with the Reddit part further divided into in-domain and cross-domain message-based subsets, as well as a profile-based subset. This design enables controlled analysis of the effects of data source, topical domain, and text length. Using the provided training splits, we conduct a systematic evaluation of strong baselines and state-of-the-art models and find that our best approach, a fine-tuned large language model, outperforms recent baselines by up to 0.09 absolute F1 score and surpasses GPT-5 in a zero-shot setting by 0.08. We further observe a trade-off between specialization and generalization: models trained on specific data types perform best under matching conditions but generalize less well across data regimes, a limitation that can be mitigated by combining training sources. Overall, GerAV provides a challenging and versatile benchmark for advancing research on German and cross-domain AV.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13711v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SWE-Tester: Training Open-Source LLMs for Issue Reproduction in Real-World Repositories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13713</link><description>arXiv:2601.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software testing is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of software systems. Automated generation of issue reproduction tests from natural language issue descriptions enhances developer productivity by simplifying root cause analysis, promotes test-driven development -- "test first, write code later", and can be used for improving the effectiveness of automated issue resolution systems like coding agents. Existing methods proposed for this task predominantly rely on closed-source LLMs, with limited exploration of open models. To address this, we propose SWE-Tester -- a novel pipeline for training open-source LLMs to generate issue reproduction tests. First, we curate a high-quality training dataset of 41K instances from 2.6K open-source GitHub repositories and use it to train LLMs of varying sizes and families. The fine-tuned models achieve absolute improvements of up to 10\% in success rate and 21\% in change coverage on SWT-Bench Verified. Further analysis shows consistent improvements with increased inference-time compute, more data, and larger models. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework for advancing open-source LLMs in this domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MVGD-Net: A Novel Motion-aware Video Glass Surface Detection Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13715</link><description>arXiv:2601.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glass surface ubiquitous in both daily life and professional environments presents a potential threat to vision-based systems, such as robot and drone navigation. To solve this challenge, most recent studies have shown significant interest in Video Glass Surface Detection (VGSD). We observe that objects in the reflection (or transmission) layer appear farther from the glass surfaces. Consequently, in video motion scenarios, the notable reflected (or transmitted) objects on the glass surface move slower than objects in non-glass regions within the same spatial plane, and this motion inconsistency can effectively reveal the presence of glass surfaces. Based on this observation, we propose a novel network, named MVGD-Net, for detecting glass surfaces in videos by leveraging motion inconsistency cues. Our MVGD-Net features three novel modules: the Cross-scale Multimodal Fusion Module (CMFM) that integrates extracted spatial features and estimated optical flow maps, the History Guided Attention Module (HGAM) and Temporal Cross Attention Module (TCAM), both of which further enhances temporal features. A Temporal-Spatial Decoder (TSD) is also introduced to fuse the spatial and temporal features for generating the glass region mask. Furthermore, for learning our network, we also propose a large-scale dataset, which comprises 312 diverse glass scenarios with a total of 19,268 frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MVGD-Net outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13715v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simulated Ignorance Fails: A Systematic Study of LLM Behaviors on Forecasting Problems Before Model Knowledge Cutoff</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13717</link><description>arXiv:2601.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating LLM forecasting capabilities is constrained by a fundamental tension: prospective evaluation offers methodological rigor but prohibitive latency, while retrospective forecasting (RF) -- evaluating on already-resolved events -- faces rapidly shrinking clean evaluation data as SOTA models possess increasingly recent knowledge cutoffs. Simulated Ignorance (SI), prompting models to suppress pre-cutoff knowledge, has emerged as a potential solution. We provide the first systematic test of whether SI can approximate True Ignorance (TI). Across 477 competition-level questions and 9 models, we find that SI fails systematically: (1) cutoff instructions leave a 52% performance gap between SI and TI; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning fails to suppress prior knowledge, even when reasoning traces contain no explicit post-cutoff references; (3) reasoning-optimized models exhibit worse SI fidelity despite superior reasoning trace quality. These findings demonstrate that prompts cannot reliably "rewind" model knowledge. We conclude that RF on pre-cutoff events is methodologically flawed; we recommend against using SI-based retrospective setups to benchmark forecasting capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13717v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Long Video Understanding with Audiovisual Entity Cohesion and Agentic Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13719</link><description>arXiv:2601.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long video understanding presents significant challenges for vision-language models due to extremely long context windows. Existing solutions relying on naive chunking strategies with retrieval-augmented generation, typically suffer from information fragmentation and a loss of global coherence. We present HAVEN, a unified framework for long-video understanding that enables coherent and comprehensive reasoning by integrating audiovisual entity cohesion and hierarchical video indexing with agentic search. First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench. Notably, it achieves outstanding performance in the challenging reasoning category, reaching 80.1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured, multimodal reasoning for comprehensive and context-consistent understanding of long-form videos.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13719v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OP-Bench: Benchmarking Over-Personalization for Memory-Augmented Personalized Conversational Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13722</link><description>arXiv:2601.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory-augmented conversational agents enable personalized interactions using long-term user memory and have gained substantial traction. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on whether agents can recall and apply user information, while overlooking whether such personalization is used appropriately. In fact, agents may overuse personal information, producing responses that feel forced, intrusive, or socially inappropriate to users. We refer to this issue as \emph{over-personalization}. In this work, we formalize over-personalization into three types: Irrelevance, Repetition, and Sycophancy, and introduce \textbf{OP-Bench} a benchmark of 1,700 verified instances constructed from long-horizon dialogue histories. Using \textbf{OP-Bench}, we evaluate multiple large language models and memory-augmentation methods, and find that over-personalization is widespread when memory is introduced. Further analysis reveals that agents tend to retrieve and over-attend to user memories even when unnecessary. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{Self-ReCheck}, a lightweight, model-agnostic memory filtering mechanism that mitigates over-personalization while preserving personalization performance. Our work takes an initial step toward more controllable and appropriate personalization in memory-augmented dialogue systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13722v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Facial Spatiotemporal Graphs: Leveraging the 3D Facial Surface for Remote Physiological Measurement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13724</link><description>arXiv:2601.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) methods estimate physiological signals by modeling subtle color changes on the 3D facial surface over time. However, existing methods fail to explicitly align their receptive fields with the 3D facial surface-the spatial support of the rPPG signal. To address this, we propose the Facial Spatiotemporal Graph (STGraph), a novel representation that encodes facial color and structure using 3D facial mesh sequences-enabling surface-aligned spatiotemporal processing. We introduce MeshPhys, a lightweight spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that operates on the STGraph to estimate physiological signals. Across four benchmark datasets, MeshPhys achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance in both intra- and cross-dataset settings. Ablation studies show that constraining the model's receptive field to the facial surface acts as a strong structural prior, and that surface-aligned, 3D-aware node features are critical for robustly encoding facial surface color. Together, the STGraph and MeshPhys constitute a novel, principled modeling paradigm for facial rPPG, enabling robust, interpretable, and generalizable estimation.

Abstract: VeriFast is a leading tool for the modular formal verification of correctness properties of single-threaded and multi-threaded C and Rust programs. It verifies a program by symbolically executing each function in isolation, exploiting user-annotated preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants written in a form of separation logic, and using a separation logic-based symbolic representation of memory. However, the tool itself, written in roughly 30K lines of OCaml code, has not been formally verified. Therefore, bugs in the tool could cause it to falsely report the correctness of the input program. We here report on an early result extending VeriFast to emit, upon successful verification of a Rust program, a Rocq proof script that proves correctness of the program with respect to a Rocq-encoded axiomatic semantics of Rust. This significantly enhances VeriFast's applicability in safety-critical domains. We apply hinted mirroring: we record key information from VeriFast's symbolic execution run, and use it to direct a replay of the run in Rocq.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13727v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Temperature-Constrained Non-Deterministic Machine Translation: Potential and Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13729</link><description>arXiv:2601.13729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the non-deterministic properties of language models have garnered considerable attention and have shown a significant influence on real-world applications. However, such properties remain under-explored in machine translation (MT), a complex, non-deterministic NLP task. In this study, we systematically evaluate modern MT systems and identify temperature-constrained Non-Deterministic MT (ND-MT) as a distinct phenomenon. Additionally, we demonstrate that ND-MT exhibits significant potential in addressing the multi-modality issue that has long challenged MT research and provides higher-quality candidates than Deterministic MT (D-MT) under temperature constraints. However, ND-MT introduces new challenges in evaluating system performance. Specifically, the evaluation framework designed for D-MT fails to yield consistent evaluation results when applied to ND-MT. We further investigate this emerging challenge by evaluating five state-of-the-art ND-MT systems across three open datasets using both lexical-based and semantic-based metrics at varying sampling sizes. The results reveal a Buckets effect across these systems: the lowest-quality candidate generated by ND-MT consistently determines the overall system ranking across different sampling sizes for all reasonable metrics. Furthermore, we propose the ExpectoSample strategy to automatically assess the reliability of evaluation metrics for selecting robust ND-MT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13729v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking the Data Barrier in Learning Symbolic Computation: A Case Study on Variable Ordering Suggestion for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13731</link><description>arXiv:2601.13731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic computation, powered by modern computer algebra systems, has important applications in mathematical reasoning through exact deep computations. The efficiency of symbolic computation is largely constrained by such deep computations in high dimension. This creates a fundamental barrier on labelled data acquisition if leveraging supervised deep learning to accelerate symbolic computation. Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is a pillar symbolic computation method for reasoning with first-order logic formulas over reals with many applications in formal verification and automatic theorem proving. Variable orderings have a huge impact on its efficiency. Impeded by the difficulty to acquire abundant labelled data, existing learning-based approaches are only competitive with the best expert-based heuristics. In this work, we address this problem by designing a series of intimately connected tasks for which a large amount of annotated data can be easily obtained. We pre-train a Transformer model with these data and then fine-tune it on the datasets for CAD ordering. Experiments on publicly available CAD ordering datasets show that on average the orderings predicted by the new model are significantly better than those suggested by the best heuristic methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13731v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SUNSET -- A Sensor-fUsioN based semantic SegmEnTation exemplar for ROS-based self-adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13732</link><description>arXiv:2601.13732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fact that robots are getting deployed more often in dynamic environments, together with the increasing complexity of their software systems, raises the need for self-adaptive approaches. In these environments robotic software systems increasingly operate amid (1) uncertainties, where symptoms are easy to observe but root causes are ambiguous, or (2) multiple uncertainties appear concurrently.

It implements a sensor fusion semantic-segmentation pipeline driven by a trained Machine Learning (ML) model whose input preprocessing can be perturbed to induce realistic performance degradations. The exemplar exposes five observable symptoms, where each can be caused by different root causes and supports concurrent uncertainties spanning self-healing and self-optimisation. SUNSET includes the segmentation pipeline, a trained ML model, uncertainty-injection scripts, a baseline controller, and step-by-step integration and evaluation documentation to facilitate reproducible studies and fair comparison.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13732v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards robust long-context understanding of large language model via active recap learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13734</link><description>arXiv:2601.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose active recap learning (ARL), a framework for enhancing large language model (LLM) in understanding long contexts. ARL enables models to revisit and summarize earlier content through targeted sequence construction during contined pretraining and retrospective summarization at inference.

Second, ARL equips models with the ability to autonomously generate and utilize these retrospective summaries during inference, thereby establishing a recursive memory mechanism across paragraphs. Experimental results show substantial gains, with ARL achieving a 26.8% improvement on RULER and a 9.44% improvement on LongBench.

Abstract: Probabilistic confidence metrics are increasingly adopted as proxies for reasoning quality in Best-of-N selection, under the assumption that higher confidence reflects higher reasoning fidelity. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether these metrics truly capture inter-step causal dependencies necessary for valid reasoning. We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead.

This leaves current automatic Speech-to-Speech (S2S) evaluation methods reliant on opaque and expensive Audio Language Models (ALMs). In this work, we propose TRACE (Textual Reasoning over Audio Cues for Evaluation), a novel framework that enables LLM judges to reason over audio cues to achieve cost-efficient and human-aligned S2S evaluation. To demonstrate the strength of the framework, we first introduce a Human Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) annotation protocol to improve the diagnostic capability of existing judge benchmarks by separating evaluation into explicit dimensions: content (C), voice quality (VQ), and paralinguistics (P). Using this data, TRACE constructs a textual blueprint of inexpensive audio signals and prompts an LLM to render dimension-wise judgments, fusing them into an overall rating via a deterministic policy. TRACE achieves higher agreement with human raters than ALMs and transcript-only LLM judges while being significantly more cost-effective. We will release the HCoT annotations and the TRACE framework to enable scalable and human-aligned S2S evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Variational Dual-path Attention Network for CSI-Based Gesture Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13745</link><description>arXiv:2601.13745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi gesture recognition based on Channel State Information (CSI) is challenged by high-dimensional noise and resource constraints on edge devices. Prevailing end-to-end models tightly couple feature extraction with classification, overlooking the inherent time-frequency sparsity of CSI and leading to redundancy and poor generalization. To address this, this paper proposes a lightweight feature preprocessing module--the Variational Dual-path Attention Network (VDAN). It performs structured feature refinement through frequency-domain filtering and temporal detection. Variational inference is introduced to model the uncertainty in attention weights, thereby enhancing robustness to noise. The design principles of the module are explained from the perspectives of the information bottleneck and regularization. Experiments on a public dataset demonstrate that the learned attention weights align with the physical sparse characteristics of CSI, verifying its interpretability. This work provides an efficient and explainable front-end processing solution for resource-constrained wireless sensing systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13745v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EEG-Titans: Long-Horizon Seizure Forecasting via Dual-Branch Attention and Neural Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13748</link><description>arXiv:2601.13748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate epileptic seizure prediction from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging because pre-ictal dynamics may span long time horizons while clinically relevant signatures can be subtle and transient. Many deep learning models face a persistent trade-off between capturing local spatiotemporal patterns and maintaining informative long-range context when operating on ultralong sequences. We propose EEG-Titans, a dualbranch architecture that incorporates a modern neural memory mechanism for long-context modeling. The model combines sliding-window attention to capture short-term anomalies with a recurrent memory pathway that summarizes slower, progressive trends over time. On the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, evaluated under a chronological holdout protocol, EEG-Titans achieves 99.46% average segment-level sensitivity across 18 subjects. We further analyze safety-first operating points on artifact-prone recordings and show that a hierarchical context strategy extending the receptive field for high-noise subjects can markedly reduce false alarms (down to 0.00 FPR/h in an extreme outlier) without sacrificing sensitivity. These results indicate that memory-augmented long-context modeling can provide robust seizure forecasting under clinically constrained evaluation</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13748v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pro-AI Bias in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13749</link><description>arXiv:2601.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for decision-support across multiple domains. We investigate whether these models display a systematic preferential bias in favor of artificial intelligence (AI) itself. Across three complementary experiments, we find consistent evidence of pro-AI bias. First, we show that LLMs disproportionately recommend AI-related options in response to diverse advice-seeking queries, with proprietary models doing so almost deterministically. Second, we demonstrate that models systematically overestimate salaries for AI-related jobs relative to closely matched non-AI jobs, with proprietary models overestimating AI salaries more by 10 percentage points. Finally, probing internal representations of open-weight models reveals that ``Artificial Intelligence'' exhibits the highest similarity to generic prompts for academic fields under positive, negative, and neutral framings alike, indicating valence-invariant representational centrality. These patterns suggest that LLM-generated advice and valuation can systematically skew choices and perceptions in high-stakes decisions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HiT: History-Injection Transformers for Onboard Continuous Flood Change Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13751</link><description>arXiv:2601.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural disaster monitoring through continuous satellite observation requires processing multi-temporal data under strict operational constraints. This paper addresses flood detection, a critical application for hazard management, by developing an onboard change detection system that operates within the memory and computational limits of small satellites. We propose History Injection mechanism for Transformer models (HiT), that maintains historical context from previous observations while reducing data storage by over 99\% of original image size. Moreover, testing on the STTORM-CD flood dataset confirms that the HiT mechanism within the Prithvi-tiny foundation model maintains detection accuracy compared to the bitemporal baseline. The proposed HiT-Prithvi model achieved 43 FPS on Jetson Orin Nano, a representative onboard hardware used in nanosats.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex problem-solving, yet they often suffer from computational redundancy or reasoning unfaithfulness. Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13752v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Research on Adaptive Inertial Control in Synchronization Systems: Based on Variational Optimization Methods and Their Applications in the Stability of Complex Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13753</link><description>arXiv:2601.13753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming at the core problem that it is difficult for a fixed inertia coefficient to balance transient disturbance suppression and long-term stability in complex network synchronization systems, an adaptive inertia control strategy based on variational optimization is proposed. Taking the Kuramoto model with inertia as the research carrier, the analytical expression of the time-varying inertia coefficient M(t) is strictly derived by the functional variational method, and a hierarchical control structure of "benchmark inertia + disturbance feedback" is constructed to achieve the organic unity of minimizing the vulnerability performance function H(T) and stability constraints. A multimodal decoupling control strategy based on Laplacian eigenvector projection is designed to enhance the feedback strength of the dominant mode by eigenvalue weighting, improving the control accuracy and dynamic response speed. Simulation verification is carried out in complex network systems, and the control performance of regular networks (RG), random networks (ER), small-world networks (SW), scale-free networks (SF) and spider webs (SP) under three typical disturbances of pulses, monotonic decays and oscillatory decays is systematically analyzed. The results show that the proposed strategy reduces H(T) of the five networks by 19%-25%, shortens the relaxation time by 15%-24%, and the real parts of all system eigenvalues are less than -0.25s^-1 , meeting the asymptotic stability criterion. This study provides a new theoretical framework and engineering implementation scheme for the stability control of complex network synchronization systems, which can be widely applied to fields such as power grids, communication networks, and neural networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13753v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Autopilot?

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly automate software engineering tasks. While recent studies highlight the accelerated adoption of ``AI as a teammate'' in Open Source Software (OSS), developer interaction patterns remain under-explored. In this work, we investigated project-level guidelines and developers' interactions with AI-assisted pull requests (PRs) by expanding the AIDev dataset to include finer-grained contributor code ownership and a comparative baseline of human-created PRs. We found that over 67.5\% of AI-co-authored PRs originate from contributors without prior code ownership. Despite this, the majority of repositories lack guidelines for AI-coding agent usage. Notably, we observed a distinct interaction pattern: AI-co-authored PRs are merged significantly faster with minimal feedback. In contrast to human-created PRs where non-owner developers receive the most feedback, AI-co-authored PRs from non-owners receive the least, with approximately 80\% merged without any explicit review. Finally, we discuss implications for developers and researchers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13754v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Limits of Conditional Volatility: Assessing Cryptocurrency VaR under EWMA and IGARCH Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13757</link><description>arXiv:2601.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of the standard static Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model for cryptocurrency risk management resulted in a systemic failure, evidenced by a 80.67% chance of loss in the 5% value-at-risk benchmark. This study addresses a critical literature gap by comparatively testing three conditional volatility models the EWMA/IGARCH baseline, an IGARCH model augmented with explicit mean reversion (IGARCH + MR), and a modified EGARCH-style asymmetric shock model within a correlated Monte Carlo VaR framework. Crucially, the analysis is applied specifically to high-beta altcoins (XRP, SOL, ADA), an asset class largely neglected by mainstream GARCH literature. Our results demonstrate that imposing stationarity (IGARCH + MR) drastically underestimates downside risk (5 percent value-at-risk reduced by 50%), while the asymmetric model (Model 3) leads to severe over-penalization. The EWMA/IGARCH baseline, characterized by infinite volatility persistence (alpha + beta = 1), provided the only robust conditional volatility estimate. This finding constitutes a formal rejection of the conventional financial hypotheses of volatility mean reversion and the asymmetric leverage effect in the altcoin asset class, establishing that non-stationary frameworks are a prerequisite for regulatory-grade risk modeling in this domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13757v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GOMPSNR: Reflourish the Signal-to-Noise Ratio Metric for Audio Generation Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13758</link><description>arXiv:2601.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of audio generation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has long served as an objective metric for evaluating audio quality. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that SNR and its variants are not always highly correlated with human perception, prompting us to raise the questions: Why does SNR fail in measuring audio quality? And how to improve its reliability as an objective metric? In this paper, we identify the inadequate measurement of phase distance as a pivotal factor and propose to reformulate SNR with specially designed phase-distance terms, yielding an improved metric named GOMPSNR. We further extend the newly proposed formulation to derive two novel categories of loss function, corresponding to magnitude-guided phase refinement and joint magnitude-phase optimization, respectively. Besides, extensive experiments are conducted for an optimal combination of different loss functions. Experimental results on advanced neural vocoders demonstrate that our proposed GOMPSNR exhibits more reliable error measurement than SNR. Meanwhile, our proposed loss functions yield substantial improvements in model performance, and our wellchosen combination of different loss functions further optimizes the overall model capability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13758v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DARC: Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum for LLM Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13761</link><description>arXiv:2601.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-play with large language models has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving self-improving artificial intelligence. However, existing self-play frameworks often suffer from optimization instability, due to (i) non-stationary objectives induced by solver-dependent reward feedback for the Questioner, and (ii) bootstrapping errors from self-generated pseudo-labels used to supervise the Solver. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce DARC (Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum), a two-stage framework that stabilizes the self-evolution process. First, we train the Questioner to synthesize difficulty-calibrated questions, conditioned on explicit difficulty levels and external corpora. Second, we train the Solver with an asymmetric self-distillation mechanism, where a document-augmented teacher generates high-quality pseudo-labels to supervise the student Solver that lacks document access. Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models. Moreover, DARC consistently outperforms all baselines and approaches the performance of fully supervised models without relying on human annotations.The code is available at https://github.com/RUCBM/DARC.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TransMode-LLM: Feature-Informed Natural Language Modeling with Domain-Enhanced Prompting for Travel Behavior Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13763</link><description>arXiv:2601.13763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding traveler behavior and accurately predicting travel mode choice are at the heart of transportation planning and policy-making. This study proposes TransMode-LLM, an innovative framework that integrates statistical methods with LLM-based techniques to predict travel modes from travel survey data. The framework operates through three phases: (1) statistical analysis identifies key behavioral features, (2) natural language encoding transforms structured data into contextual descriptions, and (3) LLM adaptation predicts travel mode through multiple learning paradigms including zero-shot and one/few-shot learning and domain-enhanced prompting. We evaluate TransMode-LLM using both general-purpose models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini) and reasoning-focused models (o3-mini, o4-mini) with varying sample sizes on real-world travel survey data. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the LLM-based approach achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baseline classifiers models. Moreover, few-shot learning significantly improves prediction accuracy, with models like o3-mini showing consistent improvements of up to 42.9\% with 5 provided examples. However, domain-enhanced prompting shows divergent effects across LLM architectures. In detail, it is helpful to improve performance for general-purpose models with GPT-4o achieving improvements of 2.27% to 12.50%. However, for reasoning-oriented models (o3-mini, o4-mini), domain knowledge enhancement does not universally improve performance. This study advances the application of LLMs in travel behavior modeling, providing promising and valuable insights for both academic research and transportation policy-making in the future.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13763v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] vLinear: A Powerful Linear Model for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13768</link><description>arXiv:2601.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present \textbf{vLinear}, an effective yet efficient \textbf{linear}-based multivariate time series forecaster featuring two components: the \textbf{v}ecTrans module and the WFMLoss objective. Many state-of-the-art forecasters rely on self-attention or its variants to capture multivariate correlations, typically incurring $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ computational complexity with respect to the number of variates $N$. To address this, we propose vecTrans, a lightweight module that utilizes a learnable vector to model multivariate correlations, reducing the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Notably, vecTrans can be seamlessly integrated into Transformer-based forecasters, delivering up to 5$\times$ inference speedups and consistent performance gains. Furthermore, we introduce WFMLoss (Weighted Flow Matching Loss) as the objective. In contrast to typical \textbf{velocity-oriented} flow matching objectives, we demonstrate that a \textbf{final-series-oriented} formulation yields significantly superior forecasting accuracy. WFMLoss also incorporates path- and horizon-weighted strategies to focus learning on more reliable paths and horizons. Empirically, vLinear achieves state-of-the-art performance across 22 benchmarks and 124 forecasting settings. Moreover, WFMLoss serves as an effective plug-and-play objective, consistently improving existing forecasters.

Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enable the disaggregation of radio access functions and the deployment of control applications across different timescales. However, designing interoperable control schemes that jointly exploit long-term traffic awareness and near-real-time radio resource optimization remains a challenging problem, particularly under dense multi-cell interference and heterogeneous service demands. This paper proposes an interoperable rApp/xApp-driven dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) framework for O-RAN, based on a graph-theoretic formulation of physical resource block (PRB) assignment. The proposed architecture leverages a non-real-time radio intelligent controller (Non-RT RIC) rApp to predict aggregated traffic evolution and generate high-level spectrum policies at the minutes timescale, while a near-real-time RIC (Near-RT RIC) xApp constructs a user-centric conflict graph and performs fairness-aware PRB allocation at sub-second timescales. To mitigate persistent user starvation, a conflict-aware modified proportional fair (MPF) scheduling mechanism is applied, enabling controlled interference-free PRB time-sharing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the PRB assignment success rate (above 90%) and service-share fairness (above 85%) across different channel configurations and user demands, while maintaining architectural separation and rApp/xApp interoperability in accordance with O-RAN principles.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13769v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Look-Ahead-Bench: a Standardized Benchmark of Look-ahead Bias in Point-in-Time LLMs for Finance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13770</link><description>arXiv:2601.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Look-Ahead-Bench, a standardized benchmark measuring look-ahead bias in Point-in-Time (PiT) Large Language Models (LLMs) within realistic and practical financial workflows. Unlike most existing approaches that primarily test inner lookahead knowledge via Q\\&amp;amp;A, our benchmark evaluates model behavior in practical scenarios. To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Carbon credit systems have emerged as a policy tool to incentivize emission reductions and support the transition to clean energy. Reliable carbon-credit certification depends on mechanisms that connect actual, measured renewable-energy production to verifiable emission-reduction records. Although blockchain and IoT technologies have been applied to emission monitoring and trading, existing work offers limited support for certification processes, particularly for small and medium-scale renewable installations. This paper introduces a blockchain-based carbon-credit certification architecture, demonstrated through a 100 kWp photovoltaic case study, that integrates real-time IoT data collection, edge-level aggregation, and secure on-chain storage on a permissioned blockchain with smart contracts. Unlike approaches focused on trading mechanisms, the proposed system aligns with European legislation and voluntary carbon-market standards, clarifying the practical requirements and constraints that apply to photovoltaic operators. The resulting architecture provides a structured pathway for generating verifiable carbon-credit records and supporting third-party verification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Orthogonium : A Unified, Efficient Library of Orthogonal and 1-Lipschitz Building Blocks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13776</link><description>arXiv:2601.13776v1 Announce Type: new

Its optimized implementations reduce overhead on large scale benchmarks such as ImageNet. Moreover, rigorous testing within the library has uncovered critical errors in existing implementations, emphasizing the importance of standardized and reliable tools. Orthogonium thus significantly lowers adoption barriers, enabling scalable experimentation and integration across diverse applications requiring orthogonality and robust Lipschitz constraints.

Abstract: Geometric mechanics provides valuable insights into how biological and robotic systems use changes in shape to move by mechanically interacting with their environment. In high-friction environments it provides that the entire interaction is captured by the ``motility map''. Here we compare methods for learning the motility map from motion tracking data of a physical robot created specifically to test these methods by having under-actuated degrees of freedom and a hard to model interaction with its substrate. We compared four modeling approaches in terms of their ability to predict body velocity from shape change within the same gait, across gaits, and across speeds. Our results show a trade-off between simpler methods which are superior on small training datasets, and more sophisticated methods, which are superior when more training data is available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fit Matters: Format-Distance Alignment Improves Conversational Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13778</link><description>arXiv:2601.13778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing conversational search systems can synthesize information into responses, but they lack principled ways to adapt response formats to users' cognitive states. This paper investigates whether aligning format and distance, which involves matching information granularity and media to users' psychological distance, improves user experience. In a between-subjects experiment (N=464) on travel planning, we crossed two distance dimensions (temporal/spatial x near/far) with four formats varying in granularity (abstract/concrete) and media (text/image-and-text). The experiment established that format--distance alignment reduced users' risk perceptions while increasing decision confidence, perceptions of information usefulness, ease of use, enjoyment, and credibility, and adoption intentions. Concrete formats imposed higher cognitive load, but yielded productive effort when matched to near-distance tasks. Images enhanced concrete but not abstract text, suggesting multimedia benefits depend on complementarity. These findings establish format--distance alignment as a distinctive and important design dimension, enabling systems to tailor response formats to users' psychological distance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13778v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Principled Latent Diffusion for Graphs via Laplacian Autoencoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13780</link><description>arXiv:2601.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance in graph generation but suffer from quadratic complexity in the number of nodes -- and much of their capacity is wasted modeling the absence of edges in sparse graphs. Inspired by latent diffusion in other modalities, a natural idea is to compress graphs into a low-dimensional latent space and perform diffusion there. However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs. The dimensionality of this latent representation scales linearly with the number of nodes, eliminating the quadratic bottleneck and making it feasible to train larger and more expressive models.

Abstract: A rectangular floorplan is a partition of a rectangle into smaller rectangles such that no four rectangles meet at a single point. Rectangular floorplans arise naturally in a variety of applications, including VLSI design, architectural layout, and cartography, where efficient and flexible spatial subdivisions are required. A central concept in this domain is that of area-universality: a floorplan (or more generally, a rectangular layout) is area-universal if, for any assignment of target areas to its constituent rectangles, there exists a combinatorially equivalent layout that realizes these areas.
  In this paper, we investigate the structural conditions under which an outerplanar graph admits an area-universal rectangular layout. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for area-universality in this setting, thereby providing a complete characterization of admissible outerplanar graphs. Furthermore, we present an algorithmic construction that guarantees that the resulting layout is always area-universal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13781v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PAtt: A Pattern Attention Network for ETA Prediction Using Historical Speed Profiles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13793</link><description>arXiv:2601.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an ETA model (Estimated Time of Arrival) that leverages an attention mechanism over historical road speed patterns. As autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and reliable ETA estimation has grown, playing a vital role in navigation, mobility planning, and traffic management. However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction. ETA prediction inherently involves spatio-temporal causality, and our proposed model addresses this by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract and utilize temporal features accumulated at each spatio-temporal point along a route. This architecture enables efficient and accurate ETA estimation while keeping the model lightweight and scalable. We validate our approach using real-world driving datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by effectively integrating road characteristics, real-time traffic conditions, and historical speed patterns in a task-aware manner.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13793v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-free regions and concentration inequalities for hypergraph colorings in the local lemma regime</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13796</link><description>arXiv:2601.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for $q$-colorings in $k$-uniform hypergraphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, if $k\ge 50$ and $q\ge 700\Delta^{\frac{5}{k-10}}$, there is a "Lee-Yang" zero-free strip around the interval $[0,1]$ of the partition function, which includes the special case of uniform enumeration of hypergraph colorings. As an immediate consequence, we obtain Berry-Esseen type inequalities for hypergraph $q$-colorings under such conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic normality for the size of any color class in a uniformly random coloring. Our framework also extends to the study of "Fisher zeros", leading to deterministic algorithms for approximating the partition function in the zero-free region.
  Our approach is based on extending the recent work of [Liu, Wang, Yin, Yu, STOC 2025] to general constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). We focus on partition functions defined for CSPs by introducing external fields to the variables. A key component in our approach is a projection-lifting scheme, which enables us to essentially lift information percolation type analysis for Markov chains from the real line to the complex plane. Last but not least, we also show a Chebyshev-type inequality under the sampling LLL condition for atomic CSPs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PREGEN: Uncovering Latent Thoughts in Composed Video Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13797</link><description>arXiv:2601.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) aims to retrieve a video based on a query video and a modifying text. Current CoVR methods fail to fully exploit modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), either using outdated architectures or requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning and slow caption generation. We introduce PREGEN (PRE GENeration extraction), an efficient and powerful CoVR framework that overcomes these limitations. Our approach uniquely pairs a frozen, pre-trained VLM with a lightweight encoding model, eliminating the need for any VLM fine-tuning. We feed the query video and modifying text into the VLM and extract the hidden state of the final token from each layer. A simple encoder is then trained on these pooled representations, creating a semantically rich and compact embedding for retrieval. PREGEN significantly advances the state of the art, surpassing all prior methods on standard CoVR benchmarks with substantial gains in Recall@1 of +27.23 and +69.59. Our method demonstrates robustness across different VLM backbones and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to more complex textual modifications, highlighting its effectiveness and semantic capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13797v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Insight: Interpretable Semantic Hierarchies in Vision-Language Encoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13798</link><description>arXiv:2601.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-aligned vision foundation models perform strongly across diverse downstream tasks. Yet, their learned representations remain opaque, making interpreting their decision-making hard. Recent works decompose these representations into human-interpretable concepts, but provide poor spatial grounding and are limited to image classification tasks. In this work, we propose Insight, a language-aligned concept foundation model that provides fine-grained concepts, which are human-interpretable and spatially grounded in the input image. We leverage a hierarchical sparse autoencoder and a foundation model with strong semantic representations to automatically extract concepts at various granularities. Examining local co-occurrence dependencies of concepts allows us to define concept relationships. Through these relations we further improve concept naming and obtain richer explanations. On benchmark data, we show that Insight provides performance on classification and segmentation that is competitive with opaque foundation models while providing fine-grained, high quality concept-based explanations.

Abstract: In [1], a new modeling paradigm for developing rate-and-state-dependent, control-oriented friction models was introduced. The framework, termed Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD), combines nonlinear analytical expressions for the friction coefficient with constitutive equations for bristle-like elements. Within the FrBD framework, this letter introduces two novel formulations based on the two most general linear viscoelastic models for solids: the Generalized Maxwell (GM) and Generalized Kelvin-Voigt (GKV) elements. Both are analyzed in terms of boundedness and passivity, revealing that these properties are satisfied for any physically meaningful parametrization. An application of passivity for control design is also illustrated, considering an example from robotics. The findings of this letter systematically integrate rate-and-state dynamic friction models with linear viscoelasticity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13799v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the non--local Camassa--Holm--Kadomtsev--Petviashvili equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13800</link><description>arXiv:2601.13800v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Drones operating in human-occupied spaces suffer from insufficient communication mechanisms that create uncertainty about their intentions.

Equipped with a MEMS laser projector, onboard semi-rigid screen, and RGB camera, HoverAI perceives users through vision and voice, responding via lip-synced avatars that adapt appearance to user demographics. The system employs a multimodal pipeline combining VAD, ASR (Whisper), LLM-based intent classification, RAG for dialogue, face analysis for personalization, and voice synthesis (XTTS v2). Evaluation demonstrates high accuracy in command recognition (F1: 0.90), demographic estimation (gender F1: 0.89, age MAE: 5.14 years), and speech transcription (WER: 0.181).

Abstract: A notable gap persists in speech synthesis research and development for Arabic dialects, particularly from a unified modeling perspective. Despite its high practical value, the inherent linguistic complexity of Arabic dialects, further compounded by a lack of standardized data, benchmarks, and evaluation guidelines, steers researchers toward safer ground. To bridge this divide, we present Habibi, a suite of specialized and unified text-to-speech models that harnesses existing open-source ASR corpora to support a wide range of high- to low-resource Arabic dialects through linguistically-informed curriculum learning. Our approach outperforms the leading commercial service in generation quality, while maintaining extensibility through effective in-context learning, without requiring text diacritization. We are committed to open-sourcing the model, along with creating the first systematic benchmark for multi-dialect Arabic speech synthesis. Furthermore, by identifying the key challenges in and establishing evaluation standards for the process, we aim to provide a solid groundwork for subsequent research.

Abstract: Branch misprediction latency is one of the most important contributors to performance degradation and wasted energy consumption in a modern core. State-of-the-art predictors generally perform very well but occasionally suffer from high Misprediction Per Kilo Instruction due to hard-to-predict branches. In this work, we investigate if predicting branches using microarchitectural information, in addition to traditional branch history, can improve prediction accuracy. Our approach considers branch timing information (resolution cycle) both for older branches in the Reorder Buffer (ROB) and recently committed, and for younger branches relative to the branch we re-predict. We propose Speculative Branch Resolution (SBR) in which, N cycles after a branch allocates in the ROB, various timing information is collected and used to re-predict. Using the gem5 simulator we implement and perform a limit-study of SBR using a TAGE-Like predictor. Our experiments show that the post-alloc timing information we used was not able to yield performance gains over an unbounded TAGE-SC. However, we find two hard to predict branches where timing information did provide an advantage and thoroughly analysed one of them to understand why. This finding suggests that predictors may benefit from specific microarchitectural information to increase accuracy on specific hard to predict branches and that overriding predictions in the backend may yet yield performance benefits, but that further research is needed to determine such information vectors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowledge Graph-Assisted LLM Post-Training for Enhanced Legal Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13806</link><description>arXiv:2601.13806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM post-training has primarily relied on large text corpora and human feedback, without capturing the structure of domain knowledge. This has caused models to struggle dealing with complex reasoning tasks, especially for high-stakes professional domains. In Law, reasoning requires deep understanding of the relations between various legal concepts, a key component missing in current LLM post-training. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-assisted approach for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capability in Legal that is generalizable to other high-stakes domains. We model key legal concepts by following the \textbf{IRAC} (Issue, Rule, Analysis and Conclusion) framework, and construct a KG with 12K legal cases. We then produce training data using our IRAC KG, and conduct both Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with three state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs (30B, 49B and 70B), varying architecture and base model family. Our post-trained models obtained better average performance on 4/5 diverse legal benchmarks (14 tasks) than baselines. In particular, our 70B DPO model achieved the best score on 4/6 reasoning tasks, among baselines and a 141B SOTA legal LLM, demonstrating the effectiveness of our KG for enhancing LLMs' legal reasoning capability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DroneVLA: VLA based Aerial Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13809</link><description>arXiv:2601.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As aerial platforms evolve from passive observers to active manipulators, the challenge shifts toward designing intuitive interfaces that allow non-expert users to command these systems naturally. This work introduces a novel concept of autonomous aerial manipulation system capable of interpreting high-level natural language commands to retrieve objects and deliver them to a human user. The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera. VLA performs semantic reasoning to interpret the intent of a user prompt and generates a prioritized task queue for grasping of relevant objects in the scene. Grounding DINO and dynamic A* planning algorithm are used to navigate and safely relocate the object. To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover. We demonstrate the system's efficacy through real-world experiments for localization and navigation, which resulted in a 0.164m, 0.070m, and 0.084m of max, mean euclidean, and root-mean squared errors, respectively, highlighting the feasibility of VLA for aerial manipulation operations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13809v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Integrated Sensing and Communication for Low-Altitude Security</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13810</link><description>arXiv:2601.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense concentration of low-altitude, slow-speed, and small-size targets in the complex low-altitude environment poses significant security challenges, including failures in continuous wide-area sensing and ambiguous target intent, which existing regulatory frameworks struggle to address. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), a hallmark of next-generation mobile communication, offers a transformative approach to low-altitude security governance. By leveraging existing cellular infrastructure and spectrum resources, ISAC enables the construction of a seamless wide-area sensing network, supports intelligent feature extraction and intent inference, facilitates real-time collaborative decision-making, and establishes a dynamic trust authentication framework. This article systematically reviews the technical system, analyzes the security challenges, forecasts the enabling value of ISAC, and discusses the resulting open problems and challenges, thereby laying a foundation for future research and industrial implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GuideTouch: An Obstacle Avoidance Device for Visually Impaired</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13813</link><description>arXiv:2601.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe navigation for the visually impaired individuals remains a critical challenge, especially concerning head-level obstacles, which traditional mobility aids often fail to detect. We introduce GuideTouch, a compact, affordable, standalone wearable device designed for autonomous obstacle avoidance. The system integrates two vertically aligned Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, enabling three-dimensional environmental perception, and four vibrotactile actuators that provide directional haptic feedback. Proximity and direction information is communicated via an intuitive 4-point vibrotactile feedback system located across the user's shoulders and upper chest. For real-world robustness, the device includes a unique centrifugal self-cleaning optical cover mechanism and a sound alarm system for location if the device is dropped. We evaluated the haptic perception accuracy across 22 participants (17 male and 5 female, aged 21-48, mean 25.7, sd 6.1). Statistical analysis confirmed a significant difference between the perception accuracy of different patterns. The system demonstrated high recognition accuracy, achieving an average of 92.9% for single and double motor (primary directional) patterns. Furthermore, preliminary experiments with 14 visually impaired users validated this interface, showing a recognition accuracy of 93.75% for primary directional cues. The results demonstrate that GuideTouch enables intuitive spatial perception and could significantly improve the safety, confidence, and autonomy of users with visual impairments during independent navigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13813v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From RTL to Prompt Coding: Empowering the Next Generation of Chip Designers through LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13815</link><description>arXiv:2601.13815v1 Announce Type: new

The proposed approach integrates an LLM-based chat agent into a browser-based workflow built upon the Tiny Tapeout ecosystem. The workflow guides users from an initial design idea through RTL code generation to a tapeout-ready chip. To evaluate the concept, a case study was conducted with 18 high-school students. Within a 90-minute session they developed eight functional VGA chip designs in a 130 nm technology. Despite having no prior experience in chip design, all groups successfully implemented tapeout-ready projects. The results demonstrate the feasibility and educational impact of LLM-assisted chip design, highlighting its potential to attract and inspire early learners and significantly broaden the target audience for the field.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13815v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discriminant Learning-based Colorspace for Blade Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13816</link><description>arXiv:2601.13816v1 Announce Type: new

This work presents a novel multidimensional nonlinear discriminant analysis algorithm, Colorspace Discriminant Analysis (CSDA), for improved segmentation. Extending Linear Discriminant Analysis into a deep learning context, CSDA customizes color representation by maximizing multidimensional signed inter-class separability while minimizing intra-class variability through a generalized discriminative loss. To ensure stable training, we introduce three alternative losses that enable end-to-end optimization of both the discriminative colorspace and segmentation process. Experiments on wind turbine blade data demonstrate significant accuracy gains, emphasizing the importance of tailored preprocessing in domain-specific segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ELSA: Efficient LLM-Centric Split Aggregation for Privacy-Aware Hierarchical Federated Learning over Resource-Constrained Edge Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13824</link><description>arXiv:2601.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) at the network edge faces fundamental challenges arising from device resource constraints, severe data heterogeneity, and heightened privacy risks. To address these, we propose ELSA (Efficient LLM-centric Split Aggregation), a novel framework that systematically integrates split learning (SL) and hierarchical federated learning (HFL) for distributed LLM fine-tuning over resource-constrained edge networks. ELSA introduces three key innovations. First, it employs a task-agnostic, behavior-aware client clustering mechanism that constructs semantic fingerprints using public probe inputs and symmetric KL divergence, further enhanced by prediction-consistency-based trust scoring and latency-aware edge assignment to jointly address data heterogeneity, client unreliability, and communication constraints. Second, it splits the LLM into three parts across clients and edge servers, with the cloud used only for adapter aggregation, enabling an effective balance between on-device computation cost and global convergence stability. Third, it incorporates a lightweight communication scheme based on computational sketches combined with semantic subspace orthogonal perturbation (SS-OP) to reduce communication overhead while mitigating privacy leakage during model exchanges. Experiments across diverse NLP tasks demonstrate that ELSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, convergence behavior, and robustness, establishing a scalable and privacy-aware solution for edge-side LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13824v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MirageNet:A Secure, Efficient, and Scalable On-Device Model Protection in Heterogeneous TEE and GPU System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13826</link><description>arXiv:2601.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As edge devices gain stronger computing power, deploying high-performance DNN models on untrusted hardware has become a practical approach to cut inference latency and protect user data privacy. Given high model training costs and user experience requirements, balancing model privacy and low runtime overhead is critical. TEEs offer a viable defense, and prior work has proposed heterogeneous GPU-TEE inference frameworks via parameter obfuscation to balance efficiency and confidentiality. However, recent studies find partial obfuscation defenses ineffective, while robust schemes cause unacceptable latency. To resolve these issues, we propose ConvShatter, a novel obfuscation scheme that achieves low latency and high accuracy while preserving model confidentiality and integrity. It leverages convolution linearity to decompose kernels into critical and common ones, inject confounding decoys, and permute channel/kernel orders. Pre-deployment, it performs kernel decomposition, decoy injection and order obfuscation, storing minimal recovery parameters securely in the TEE. During inference, the TEE reconstructs outputs of obfuscated convolutional layers. Extensive experiments show ConvShatter substantially reduces latency overhead with strong security guarantees; versus comparable schemes, it cuts overhead by 16% relative to GroupCover while maintaining accuracy on par with the original model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13826v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Base Station Sleeping Strategy Based on Load Sharing in Ultra-Dense Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13832</link><description>arXiv:2601.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the issues of high operational costs and low energy efficiency (EE) caused by the dense deployment of small base stations (s-BSs) in 5G ultra-dense networks (UDNs), this paper first constructs a multi-objective mathematical optimization model targeting maximizing EE and minimizing the number of active BSs. The model incorporates key constraints including BS operational state, user equipment (UE)-BS connection relationship, and load threshold, laying a theoretical foundation for the coordinated optimization of energy conservation and quality of service. Based on this model, an integrated solution combining UE-BS initial connection optimization and load-sharing based BS sleeping is proposed. In the initial connection phase, with communication quality and BS load as dual constraints, efficient matching between UEs and optimal BSs is achieved through three sequential steps: communication feasibility screening, redundant connection removal, and overload load redistribution. This resolves the problems of load imbalance and difficult identification of redundant BSs in UDNs arising from unordered initial connections. In the BS sleeping phase, a BS sleeping index, comprehensively considering UE transferability and backup BS resources, is innovatively introduced to quantify BS dormancy priority. Through a closed-loop process involving low-load BS screening, adjacent BS load evaluation, and load sharing by two takeover BSs based on their capacity, accurate dormancy of redundant BSs and collaborative load migration are realized. Simulation results in a typical UDNs scenario demonstrate that, compared with the traditional baseline scheme, the proposed solution exhibits significant advantages in convergence speed, optimization of the number of active BSs, and EE improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13832v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Role of Prosodic and Lexical Cues in Turn-Taking with Self-Supervised Speech Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13835</link><description>arXiv:2601.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid turn-taking remains a key challenge in human-robot interaction. Self-supervised speech representations (S3Rs) have driven many advances, but it remains unclear whether S3R-based turn-taking models rely on prosodic cues, lexical cues or both. We introduce a vocoder-based approach to control prosody and lexical cues in speech more cleanly than prior work. This allows us to probe the voice-activity projection model, an S3R-based turn-taking model. We find that prediction on prosody-matched, unintelligible noise is similar to accuracy on clean speech. This reveals both prosodic and lexical cues support turn-taking, but either can be used in isolation. Hence, future models may only require prosody, providing privacy and potential performance benefits. When either prosodic or lexical information is disrupted, the model exploits the other without further training, indicating they are encoded in S3Rs with limited interdependence. Results are consistent in CPC-based and wav2vec2.0 S3Rs. We discuss our findings and highlight a number of directions for future work.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong omni-modal perception, their ability to forecast future events from audio-visual cues remains largely unexplored, as existing benchmarks focus mainly on retrospective understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce FutureOmni, the first benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal future forecasting from audio-visual environments. The evaluated models are required to perform cross-modal causal and temporal reasoning, as well as effectively leverage internal knowledge to predict future events. FutureOmni is constructed via a scalable LLM-assisted, human-in-the-loop pipeline and contains 919 videos and 1,034 multiple-choice QA pairs across 8 primary domains. Evaluations on 13 omni-modal and 7 video-only models show that current systems struggle with audio-visual future prediction, particularly in speech-heavy scenarios, with the best accuracy of 64.8% achieved by Gemini 3 Flash. To mitigate this limitation, we curate a 7K-sample instruction-tuning dataset and propose an Omni-Modal Future Forecasting (OFF) training strategy. Evaluations on FutureOmni and popular audio-visual and video-only benchmarks demonstrate that OFF enhances future forecasting and generalization. We publicly release all code (https://github.com/OpenMOSS/FutureOmni) and datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenMOSS-Team/FutureOmni).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FastGHA: Generalized Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Head Avatars with Real-Time Animation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13837</link><description>arXiv:2601.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D Gaussian-based head avatar modeling, efficiently generating high fidelity avatars remains a challenge. Current methods typically rely on extensive multi-view capture setups or monocular videos with per-identity optimization during inference, limiting their scalability and ease of use on unseen subjects. To overcome these efficiency drawbacks, we propose \OURS, a feed-forward method to generate high-quality Gaussian head avatars from only a few input images while supporting real-time animation. Our approach directly learns a per-pixel Gaussian representation from the input images, and aggregates multi-view information using a transformer-based encoder that fuses image features from both DINOv3 and Stable Diffusion VAE. For real-time animation, we extend the explicit Gaussian representations with per-Gaussian features and introduce a lightweight MLP-based dynamic network to predict 3D Gaussian deformations from expression codes. Furthermore, to enhance geometric smoothness of the 3D head, we employ point maps from a pre-trained large reconstruction model as geometry supervision. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both rendering quality and inference efficiency, while supporting real-time dynamic avatar animation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Predictive and Preventive Digital Twin Framework for Indoor Wireless Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13838</link><description>arXiv:2601.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi networks increasingly suffer from performance degradation caused by contention-based channel access, dense deployments, and largely self-managed operation among mutually interfering access points (APs). In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT) framework that captures the essential spatial and temporal characteristics of wireless channels and traffic patterns, enabling the prediction of likely future network scenarios while respecting physical constraints. Leveraging this predictive capability, we introduce two analytically derived performance upper bounds-one based on Shannon capacity and the other on latency behavior under CSMA-CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)-that can be evaluated efficiently without time-consuming network simulations. By applying importance sampling to DT-generated scenarios, potentially risky network conditions can be identified within large stochastic scenario spaces. These same performance bounds are then used to proactively guide a gradient-based search for improved network configurations, with the objective of avoiding imminent performance degradation rather than pursuing globally optimal but fragile solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully predict time-dependent network congestion and mitigate it in advance, highlighting its potential for predictive and preventive Wi-Fi network management.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DisasterVQA: A Visual Question Answering Benchmark Dataset for Disaster Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13839</link><description>arXiv:2601.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media imagery provides a low-latency source of situational information during natural and human-induced disasters, enabling rapid damage assessment and response. While Visual Question Answering (VQA) has shown strong performance in general-purpose domains, its suitability for the complex and safety-critical reasoning required in disaster response remains unclear. We introduce DisasterVQA, a benchmark dataset designed for perception and reasoning in crisis contexts. DisasterVQA consists of 1,395 real-world images and 4,405 expert-curated question-answer pairs spanning diverse events such as floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. Grounded in humanitarian frameworks including FEMA ESF and OCHA MIRA, the dataset includes binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions covering situational awareness and operational decision-making tasks. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art vision-language models and find performance variability across question types, disaster categories, regions, and humanitarian tasks. Although models achieve high accuracy on binary questions, they struggle with fine-grained quantitative reasoning, object counting, and context-sensitive interpretation, particularly for underrepresented disaster scenarios. DisasterVQA provides a challenging and practical benchmark to guide the development of more robust and operationally meaningful vision-language models for disaster response. The dataset is publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/18267770.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13839v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Reversible Watermarking in Encrypted Images Based on Dual-MSBs Spiral Embedding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13840</link><description>arXiv:2601.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust reversible watermarking in encrypted images (RRWEI) faces an inherent challenge in simultaneously achieving robustness, reversibility, and content privacy under severely constrained embedding capacity. Existing RRWEI schemes often exhibit limited robustness against noise, lossy compression, and cropping attacks due to insufficient redundancy in the encrypted domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel RRWEI framework that couples dual most significant bit-plane (dual-MSBs) embedding with spatial redundancy and error-correcting coding. By compressing prediction-error bit-planes, sufficient embedding space and auxiliary information for lossless reconstruction are reserved. The dual-MSBs are further reorganized using a spiral embedding strategy to distribute multiple redundant watermark copies across spatially dispersed regions, enhancing robustness against both noise and spatial loss.Experimental results on standard test images demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms under evaluated settings robustness against Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, and diverse cropping attacks, while maintaining perfect reversibility and high embedding capacity. Compared with state-of-the-art RRWEI schemes, the proposed framework achieves substantially lower bit-error rates and more stable performance under a wide range of attack scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Small Models, Big Impact: Tool-Augmented AI Agents for Wireless Network Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13843</link><description>arXiv:2601.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT promise revolutionary capabilities for Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks but their massive computational requirements and tendency to generate technically incorrect information create deployment barriers. In this work, we introduce MAINTAINED: autonomous artificial intelligence agent for wireless network deployment. Instead of encoding domain knowledge within model parameters, our approach orchestrates specialized computational tools for geographic analysis, signal propagation modeling, and network optimization. In a real-world case study, MAINTAINED outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs including ChatGPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and DeepSeek-R1 by up to 100-fold in verified performance metrics while requiring less computational resources. This paradigm shift, moving from relying on parametric knowledge towards externalizing domain knowledge into verifiable computational tools, eliminates hallucination in technical specifications and enables edge-deployable Artificial Intelligence (AI) for wireless communications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13843v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal L2 Regularization in High-dimensional Continual Linear Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13844</link><description>arXiv:2601.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalization in an overparameterized continual linear regression setting, where a model is trained with L2 (isotropic) regularization across a sequence of tasks. We derive a closed-form expression for the expected generalization loss in the high-dimensional regime that holds for arbitrary linear teachers. We demonstrate that isotropic regularization mitigates label noise under both single-teacher and multiple i.i.d. teacher settings, whereas prior work accommodating multiple teachers either did not employ regularization or used memory-demanding methods. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal fixed regularization strength scales nearly linearly with the number of tasks $T$, specifically as $T/\ln T$. To our knowledge, this is the first such result in theoretical continual learning. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments on linear regression and neural networks, illustrating how this scaling law affects generalization and offering a practical recipe for the design of continual learning systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13844v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Virtual Urbanism: An AI-Driven Framework for Quantifying Urban Identity.

Abstract: This paper introduces Virtual Urbanism (VU), a multimodal AI-driven analytical framework for quantifying urban identity through the medium of synthetic urban replicas. The framework aims to advance computationally tractable urban identity metrics. To demonstrate feasibility, the pilot study Virtual Urbanism and Tokyo Microcosms is presented. A pipeline integrating Stable Diffusion and LoRA models was used to produce synthetic replicas of nine Tokyo areas rendered as dynamic synthetic urban sequences, excluding existing orientation markers to elicit core identity-forming elements. Human-evaluation experiments (I) assessed perceptual legitimacy of replicas; (II) quantified area-level identity; (III) derived core identity-forming elements. Results showed a mean identification accuracy of ~81%, confirming the validity of the replicas. Urban Identity Level (UIL) metric enabled assessment of identity levels across areas, while semantic analysis revealed culturally embedded typologies as core identity-forming elements, positioning VU as a viable framework for AI-augmented urban analysis, outlining a path toward automated, multi-parameter identity metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inverting Self-Organizing Maps: A Unified Activation-Based Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13851</link><description>arXiv:2601.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Organizing Maps provide topology-preserving projections of high-dimensional data and have been widely used for visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13851v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probabilistic Deep Discriminant Analysis for Wind Blade Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13852</link><description>arXiv:2601.13852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear discriminant analysis improves class separability but struggles with non-linearly separable data. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Discriminant Analysis (DDA), which directly optimizes the Fisher criterion utilizing deep networks. To ensure stable training and avoid computational instabilities, we incorporate signed between-class variance, bound outputs with a sigmoid function, and convert multiplicative relationships into additive ones. We present two stable DDA loss functions and augment them with a probability loss, resulting in Probabilistic DDA (PDDA). PDDA effectively minimizes class overlap in output distributions, producing highly confident predictions with reduced within-class variance. When applied to wind blade segmentation, PDDA showcases notable advances in performance and consistency, critical for wind energy maintenance. To our knowledge, this is the first application of DDA to image segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Question-Focused Filtering for Knowledge-based VQA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13856</link><description>arXiv:2601.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) aims to answer questions by integrating images with external knowledge. Effective knowledge filtering is crucial for improving accuracy. Typical filtering methods use similarity metrics to locate relevant article sections from one article, leading to information selection errors at the article and intra-article levels. Although recent explorations of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based filtering methods demonstrate superior semantic understanding and cross-article filtering capabilities, their high computational cost limits practical application. To address these issues, this paper proposes a question-focused filtering method. This approach can perform question-focused, cross-article filtering, efficiently obtaining high-quality filtered knowledge while keeping computational costs comparable to typical methods. Specifically, we design a trainable Question-Focused Filter (QFF) and a Chunk-based Dynamic Multi-Article Selection (CDA) module, which collectively alleviate information selection errors at both the article and intra-article levels. Experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models by 4.9% on E-VQA and 3.8% on InfoSeek, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent research highlights the potential of drones to enhance pedestrian experiences, such as aiding navigation and supporting street-level activities. This paper explores the design of drone interfaces to assist pedestrians crossing dangerous roads without designated crosswalks or traffic lights, leveraging drones' ability to monitor and analyse real-time traffic data. Inspired by existing traffic signal systems, the interface communicates safety information through permissive alerts, prohibitive warnings, directional warnings, and collision emergency warnings. These safety cues were integrated into drone interfaces using in-situ projections and drone-equipped screens through an iterative design process. A mixed-methods, within-subjects VR evaluation (n=18) revealed that drone-assisted systems significantly improved pedestrian safety experiences and reduced mental workload compared to a baseline without any crossing aid, with projections outperforming screens. The findings suggest the potential for drone interfaces to be integrated into connected traffic systems. We also offer design recommendations for developing drone interfaces that support safe pedestrian crossings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HardSecBench: Benchmarking the Security Awareness of LLMs for Hardware Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13864</link><description>arXiv:2601.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into practical hardware and firmware development pipelines for code generation. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating the functional correctness of LLM-generated code, yet paid limited attention to its security issues. However, LLM-generated code that appears functionally sound may embed security flaws which could induce catastrophic damages after deployment. This critical research gap motivates us to design a benchmark for assessing security awareness under realistic specifications. In this work, we introduce HardSecBench, a benchmark with 924 tasks spanning Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) and firmware-level C, covering 76 hardware-relevant Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries. Each task includes a structured specification, a secure reference implementation, and executable tests. To automate artifact synthesis, we propose a multi-agent pipeline that decouples synthesis from verification and grounds evaluation in execution evidence, enabling reliable evaluation. Using HardSecBench, we evaluate a range of LLMs on hardware and firmware code generation and find that models often satisfy functional requirements while still leaving security risks. We also find that security results vary with prompting. These findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in LLM-assisted hardware design. Our data and code will be released soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13864v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Human-Multi-Agent Team Formation for Creative Work</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13865</link><description>arXiv:2601.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Team-based collaboration is a cornerstone of modern creative work. Recent advances in generative AI open possibilities for humans to collaborate with multiple AI agents in distinct roles to address complex creative workflows. Yet, how to form Human-Multi-Agent Teams (HMATs) is underexplored, especially given that inter-agent interactions increase complexity and the risk of unexpected behaviors. In this exploratory study, we aim to understand how to form HMATs for creative work using CrafTeam, a technology probe that allows users to form and collaborate with their teams. We conducted a study with 12 design practitioners, in which participants iterated through a three-step cycle: forming HMATs, ideating with their teams, and reflecting on their teams' ideation. Our findings reveal that while participants initially attempted autonomous team operations, they ultimately adopted team formations in which they directly orchestrated agents. We discuss design considerations for HMAT formation that humans can effectively orchestrate multiple agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13865v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OCCAM: Class-Agnostic, Training-Free, Prior-Free and Multi-Class Object Counting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13871</link><description>arXiv:2601.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-Agnostic object Counting (CAC) involves counting instances of objects from arbitrary classes within an image. Due to its practical importance, CAC has received increasing attention in recent years. Most existing methods assume a single object class per image, rely on extensive training of large deep learning models and address the problem by incorporating additional information, such as visual exemplars or text prompts. In this paper, we present OCCAM, the first training-free approach to CAC that operates without the need of any supplementary information. Moreover, our approach addresses the multi-class variant of the problem, as it is capable of counting the object instances in each and every class among arbitrary object classes within an image. We leverage Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a foundation model, and a custom threshold-based variant of the First Integer Neighbor Clustering Hierarchy (FINCH) algorithm to achieve competitive performance on widely used benchmark datasets, FSC-147 and CARPK. We propose a synthetic multi-class dataset and F1 score as a more suitable evaluation metric.

Abstract: In the current era of interconnected cyberspace, there is an adverse effect of ransomware on individuals, startups, and large companies. Cybercriminals hold digital assets till the demand for payment is made. The success of ransomware upsurged with the introduction of Ransomware as a Service(RaaS) franchise in the darknet market. Obfuscation and polymorphic nature of malware make them more difficult to identify by Antivirus system. Signature based intrusion detection is still on role suffering from the scarcity of RaaS packet signatures. We have analysed RaaS samples by network forensic approach to investigate on packet captures of benign and malicious network traffic. The behavior analysis of RaaS family Ransomwares, Ryuk and Gandcrab have been investigated to classify the packets as suspicious, malicious, and non-malicious which further aid in generating RaaS packet signatures for early detection and mitigation of ransomwares belonging to RaaS family. More than 40\% of packets are found malicious in this experiment. The proposed method is also verified by Virus Total API Approach. Further, the proposed approach is recommended for integration into honeypots in the present scenario to combat with data scarcity concerned with malware samples(RaaS). This data will be helpful in developing AI-based threat intelligence mechanisms. In turn enhance detection, prevention of threats, incident response and risk assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13873v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pedagogical Alignment for Vision-Language-Action Models: A Comprehensive Framework for Data, Architecture, and Evaluation in Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13876</link><description>arXiv:2601.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science demonstrations are important for effective STEM education, yet teachers face challenges in conducting them safely and consistently across multiple occasions, where robotics can be helpful. However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models require substantial computational resources and sacrifice language generation capabilities to maximize efficiency, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained educational settings that require interpretable, explanation-generating systems. We present \textit{Pedagogical VLA Framework}, a framework that applies pedagogical alignment to lightweight VLA models through four components: text healing to restore language generation capabilities, large language model (LLM) distillation to transfer pedagogical knowledge, safety training for educational environments, and pedagogical evaluation adjusted to science education contexts. We evaluate Pedagogical VLA Framework across five science demonstrations spanning physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, using an evaluation framework developed in collaboration with science education experts. Our evaluation assesses both task performance (success rate, protocol compliance, efficiency, safety) and pedagogical quality through teacher surveys and LLM-as-Judge assessment. We additionally provide qualitative analysis of generated texts. Experimental results demonstrate that Pedagogical VLA Framework achieves comparable task performance to baseline models while producing contextually appropriate educational explanations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13876v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chain-of-Thought Compression Should Not Be Blind: V-Skip for Efficient Multimodal Reasoning via Dual-Path Anchoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13879</link><description>arXiv:2601.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning significantly enhances the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), its autoregressive nature incurs prohibitive latency constraints. Current efforts to mitigate this via token compression often fail by blindly applying text-centric metrics to multimodal contexts. We identify a critical failure mode termed Visual Amnesia, where linguistically redundant tokens are erroneously pruned, leading to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce V-Skip that reformulates token pruning as a Visual-Anchored Information Bottleneck (VA-IB) optimization problem. V-Skip employs a dual-path gating mechanism that weighs token importance through both linguistic surprisal and cross-modal attention flow, effectively rescuing visually salient anchors. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL and Llama-3.2 families demonstrate that V-Skip achieves a $2.9\times$ speedup with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, it preserves fine-grained visual details, outperforming other baselines over 30\% on the DocVQA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13879v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LifeAgentBench: A Multi-dimensional Benchmark and Agent for Personal Health Assistants in Digital Health</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13880</link><description>arXiv:2601.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized digital health support requires long-horizon, cross-dimensional reasoning over heterogeneous lifestyle signals, and recent advances in mobile sensing and large language models (LLMs) make such support increasingly feasible. However, the capabilities of current LLMs in this setting remain unclear due to the lack of systematic benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce LifeAgentBench, a large-scale QA benchmark for long-horizon, cross-dimensional, and multi-user lifestyle health reasoning, containing 22,573 questions spanning from basic retrieval to complex reasoning. We release an extensible benchmark construction pipeline and a standardized evaluation protocol to enable reliable and scalable assessment of LLM-based health assistants. We then systematically evaluate 11 leading LLMs on LifeAgentBench and identify key bottlenecks in long-horizon aggregation and cross-dimensional reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we propose LifeAgent as a strong baseline agent for health assistant that integrates multi-step evidence retrieval with deterministic aggregation, achieving significant improvements compared with two widely used baselines. Case studies further demonstrate its potential in realistic daily-life scenarios. The benchmark is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LifeAgentBench-CE7B.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OpenLearnLM Benchmark: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Knowledge, Skill, and Attitude in Educational Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13882</link><description>arXiv:2601.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as educational tools, yet existing benchmarks focus on narrow skills and lack grounding in learning sciences. We introduce OpenLearnLM Benchmark, a theory-grounded framework evaluating LLMs across three dimensions derived from educational assessment theory: Knowledge (curriculum-aligned content and pedagogical understanding), Skills (scenario-based competencies organized through a four-level center-role-scenario-subscenario hierarchy), and Attitude (alignment consistency and deception resistance). Our benchmark comprises 124K+ items spanning multiple subjects, educational roles, and difficulty levels based on Bloom's taxonomy. The Knowledge domain prioritizes authentic assessment items from established benchmarks, while the Attitude domain adapts Anthropic's Alignment Faking methodology to detect behavioral inconsistency under varying monitoring conditions. Evaluation of seven frontier models reveals distinct capability profiles: Claude-Opus-4.5 excels in practical skills despite lower content knowledge, while Grok-4.1-fast leads in knowledge but shows alignment concerns. Notably, no single model dominates all dimensions, validating the necessity of multi-axis evaluation. OpenLearnLM provides an open, comprehensive framework for advancing LLM readiness in authentic educational contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13882v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constrained MARL for Coexisting TN-NTN Resource Allocation: Scalability and Flexibility</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13883</link><description>arXiv:2601.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the joint TN-NTN constrained resource allocation, where terrestrial base stations and non-terrestrial base stations coexist in the spectrum.

As common learning solutions fail to address these challenges, we propose a decomposition solution based on the special properties of the cross-segment interference, and then tackle the original problem via solving subproblems in a sequential learning manner. Furthermore, to enhance the flexibility of the learned policies, we design a stochastic training environment that captures the key characteristics of real-world systems. Simulation results tested on the full 20MHz bandwidth with various numerologies show that our solution significantly improves scalability compared to existing solutions and remains robust in highly dynamic scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13883v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Confident Rankings with Fewer Items: Adaptive LLM Evaluation with Continuous Scores</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13885</link><description>arXiv:2601.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has proven effective for efficient LLM evaluation on multiple-choice benchmarks, but modern LLM evaluation increasingly relies on generation tasks where outputs are scored continuously rather than marked correct/incorrect. We present a principled extension of IRT-based adaptive testing to continuous bounded scores (ROUGE, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge) by replacing the Bernoulli response distribution with a heteroskedastic normal distribution. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty aware ranker with adaptive stopping criteria that achieves reliable model ranking while testing as few items and as cheaply as possible. We validate our method on five benchmarks spanning n-gram-based, embedding-based, and LLM-as-judge metrics. Our method uses 2% of the items while improving ranking correlation by 0.12 {\tau} over random sampling, with 95% accuracy on confident predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13885v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Multi-Task Visual Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13886</link><description>arXiv:2601.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current visual representation learning remains bifurcated: vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) excel at global semantic alignment but lack spatial precision, while self-supervised methods (e.g., MAE, DINO) capture intricate local structures yet struggle with high-level semantic context. We argue that these paradigms are fundamentally complementary and can be integrated into a principled multi-task framework, further enhanced by dense spatial supervision. We introduce MTV, a multi-task visual pretraining framework that jointly optimizes a shared backbone across vision-language contrastive, self-supervised, and dense spatial objectives. To mitigate the need for manual annotations, we leverage high-capacity "expert" models -- such as Depth Anything V2 and OWLv2 -- to synthesize dense, structured pseudo-labels at scale. Beyond the framework, we provide a systematic investigation into the mechanics of multi-task visual learning, analyzing: (i) the marginal gain of each objective, (ii) task synergies versus interference, and (iii) scaling behavior across varying data and model scales. Our results demonstrate that MTV achieves "best-of-both-worlds" performance, significantly enhancing fine-grained spatial reasoning without compromising global semantic understanding. Our findings suggest that multi-task learning, fueled by high-quality pseudo-supervision, is a scalable path toward more general visual encoders.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human Simulation Computation: A Human-Inspired Framework for Adaptive AI Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13887</link><description>arXiv:2601.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in knowledge representation and reasoning based on textual data. However, their reliance on language material alone limits their ability to adapt, verify reasoning outcomes, and operate effectively in open and dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose Human Simulation Computation (HSC), a human-inspired computational framework that models intelligence as a continuous, closed-loop process involving thinking, action, learning, reflection, and activity scheduling, collectively referred to as the internal reasoning process. HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13887v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Inclusive External Human-Machine Interface: Exploring the Effects of Visual and Auditory eHMI for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing People</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13889</link><description>arXiv:2601.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) have been proposed to facilitate communication between Automated Vehicles (AVs) and pedestrians. However, no attention was given to Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) people. We conducted a formative study through focus groups with 6 DHH people and 6 key stakeholders (including researchers, assistive technologists, and automotive interface designers) to compare proposed eHMIs and extract key design requirements. Subsequently, we investigated the effects of visual and auditory eHMI in a virtual reality user study with 32 participants (16 DHH). Results from our scenario suggesting that (1) DHH participants spent more time looking at the AV; (2) both visual and auditory eHMIs enhanced trust, usefulness, and perceived safety; and (3) only visual eHMIs reduced the time to step into the road, time looking at the AV, gaze time, and percentage looking at active visual eHMI components. Lastly, we provided five practical implications for making eHMI inclusive of DHH people.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13889v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Objective Hierarchical Optimization with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13892</link><description>arXiv:2601.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their widespread adoption in various domains, especially due to their powerful reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are not the off-the-shelf choice to drive multi-objective optimization yet. Conventional strategies rank high in benchmarks due to their intrinsic capabilities to handle numerical inputs and careful modelling choices that balance exploration and Pareto-front exploitation, as well as handle multiple (conflicting) objectives. In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance. Empirically, it consistently outperforms the global LLM-based multi-objective optimizer and is on par with standard evolutionary and Bayesian optimization algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13892v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Location Software Model Completion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13894</link><description>arXiv:2601.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In model-driven engineering and beyond, software models are key development artifacts. In practice, they often grow to substantial size and complexity, undergoing thousands of modifications over time due to evolution, refactoring, and maintenance. The rise of AI has sparked interest in how software modeling activities can be automated. Recently, LLM-based approaches for software model completion have been proposed, however, the state of the art supports only single-location model completion by predicting changes at a specific location. Going beyond, we aim to bridge the gap toward handling coordinated changes that span multiple locations across large, complex models. Specifically, we propose a novel global embedding-based next focus predictor, NextFocus, which is capable of multi-location model completion for the first time. The predictor consists of a neural network with an attention mechanism that is trained on historical software model evolution data. Starting from an existing change, it predicts further model elements to change, potentially spanning multiple parts of the model. We evaluate our approach on multi-location model changes that have actually been performed by developers in real-world projects. NextFocus achieves promising results for multi-location model completion, even when changes are heavily spread across the model. It achieves an average Precision@k score of 0.98 for $k \leq 10$, significantly outperforming the three baseline approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13894v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OmniOVCD: Streamlining Open-Vocabulary Change Detection with SAM 3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13895</link><description>arXiv:2601.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change Detection (CD) is a fundamental task in remote sensing. It monitors the evolution of land cover over time. Based on this, Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) introduces a new requirement. It aims to reduce the reliance on predefined categories. Existing training-free OVCD methods mostly use CLIP to identify categories. These methods also need extra models like DINO to extract features. However, combining different models often causes problems in matching features and makes the system unstable. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) is introduced. It integrates segmentation and identification capabilities within one promptable model, which offers new possibilities for the OVCD task. In this paper, we propose OmniOVCD, a standalone framework designed for OVCD. By leveraging the decoupled output heads of SAM 3, we propose a Synergistic Fusion to Instance Decoupling (SFID) strategy. SFID first fuses the semantic, instance, and presence outputs of SAM 3 to construct land-cover masks, and then decomposes them into individual instance masks for change comparison. This design preserves high accuracy in category recognition and maintains instance-level consistency across images. As a result, the model can generate accurate change masks. Experiments on four public benchmarks (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, S2Looking, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 67.2, 66.5, 24.5, and 27.1 (class-average), respectively, surpassing all previous methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13895v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TractRLFusion: A GPT-Based Multi-Critic Policy Fusion Framework for Fiber Tractography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13897</link><description>arXiv:2601.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tractography plays a pivotal role in the non-invasive reconstruction of white matter fiber pathways, providing vital information on brain connectivity and supporting precise neurosurgical planning. Although traditional methods relied mainly on classical deterministic and probabilistic approaches, recent progress has benefited from supervised deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve tract reconstruction. A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization. Experiments on HCP, ISMRM, and TractoInferno datasets demonstrate that TractRLFusion outperforms individual RL policies as well as state-of-the-art classical and DRL methods in accuracy and anatomical reliability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13897v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Visually Explaining Statistical Tests with Applications in Biomedical Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13899</link><description>arXiv:2601.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural two-sample tests have recently shown strong power for detecting distributional differences between groups, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability and practical adoption in biomedical analysis. Moreover, most existing post-hoc explainability methods rely on class labels, making them unsuitable for label-free statistical testing settings. We propose an explainable deep statistical testing framework that augments deep two-sample tests with sample-level and feature-level explanations, revealing which individual samples and which input features drive statistically significant group differences. Our method highlights which image regions and which individual samples contribute most to the detected group difference, providing spatial and instance-wise insight into the test's decision. Applied to biomedical imaging data, the proposed framework identifies influential samples and highlights anatomically meaningful regions associated with disease-related variation. This work bridges statistical inference and explainable AI, enabling interpretable, label-free population analysis in medical imaging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decentralized Infrastructure for Digital Notarizing, Signing and Sharing Files using Blockchain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13907</link><description>arXiv:2601.13907v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Improved local numerical solution for the ADER-DG numerical method with a local DG predictor for solving the initial value problem for a first-order ODE system is proposed. The improved local numerical solution demonstrates convergence orders of one higher than the convergence order of the local numerical solution of the original ADER-DG numerical method and has the property of continuity at grid nodes. Rigorous proofs of the approximation orders of the local numerical solution and the improved local numerical solution are presented. Obtaining the proposed improved local numerical solution does not require significant changes to the structure of the ADER-DG numerical method. Therefore, all conclusions regarding the convergence orders of the numerical solution at grid nodes, the resulting superconvergence, and the high stability of the ADER-DG numerical method remain unchanged. A wide range of applications of the ADER-DG numerical method is presented for solving specific initial value problems for ODE systems for a wide range of polynomial degrees. The obtained results provide strong confirmation for the developed rigorous theory. The improved local numerical solution is shown to exhibit both higher accuracy and improved smoothness and point-wise comparability. Empirical convergence orders of all individual numerical solutions were calculated for a wide range of error norms, which well agree with the expected convergence orders. The rigorous proof, based on the $\epsilon$-embedding method, of the applicability of the ADER-DG numerical method with a local DG predictor to solving DAE systems is presents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgentEHR: Advancing Autonomous Clinical Decision-Making via Retrospective Summarization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13918</link><description>arXiv:2601.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated profound utility in the medical domain. However, their application to autonomous Electronic Health Records~(EHRs) navigation remains constrained by a reliance on curated inputs and simplified retrieval tasks. To bridge the gap between idealized experimental settings and realistic clinical environments, we present AgentEHR. This benchmark challenges agents to execute complex decision-making tasks, such as diagnosis and treatment planning, requiring long-range interactive reasoning directly within raw and high-noise databases. In tackling these tasks, we identify that existing summarization methods inevitably suffer from critical information loss and fractured reasoning continuity. To address this, we propose RetroSum, a novel framework that unifies a retrospective summarization mechanism with an evolving experience strategy. By dynamically re-evaluating interaction history, the retrospective mechanism prevents long-context information loss and ensures unbroken logical coherence. Additionally, the evolving strategy bridges the domain gap by retrieving accumulated experience from a memory bank. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RetroSum achieves performance gains of up to 29.16% over competitive baselines, while significantly decreasing total interaction errors by up to 92.3%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13918v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HyperWalker: Dynamic Hypergraph-Based Deep Diagnosis for Multi-Hop Clinical Modeling across EHR and X-Ray in Medical VLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13919</link><description>arXiv:2601.13919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated clinical diagnosis remains a core challenge in medical AI, which usually requires models to integrate multi-modal data and reason across complex, case-specific contexts. Although recent methods have advanced medical report generation (MRG) and visual question answering (VQA) with medical vision-language models (VLMs), these methods, however, predominantly operate under a sample-isolated inference paradigm, as such processing cases independently without access to longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) or structurally related patient examples. This paradigm limits reasoning to image-derived information alone, which ignores external complementary medical evidence for potentially more accurate diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{HyperWalker}, a \textit{Deep Diagnosis} framework that reformulates clinical reasoning via dynamic hypergraphs and test-time training. First, we construct a dynamic hypergraph, termed \textbf{iBrochure}, to model the structural heterogeneity of EHR data and implicit high-order associations among multimodal clinical information. Within this hypergraph, a reinforcement learning agent, \textbf{Walker}, navigates to and identifies optimal diagnostic paths. To ensure comprehensive coverage of diverse clinical characteristics in test samples, we incorporate a \textit{linger mechanism}, a multi-hop orthogonal retrieval strategy that iteratively selects clinically complementary neighborhood cases reflecting distinct clinical attributes. Experiments on MRG with MIMIC and medical VQA on EHRXQA demonstrate that HyperWalker achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We formulate the training of generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a Nash equilibrium seeking problem. To stabilize the training process and find a Nash equilibrium, we propose an asymmetric regularization mechanism based on the classic Tikhonov step and on a novel zero-centered gradient penalty. Under smoothness and a local identifiability condition induced by a Gauss-Newton Gramian, we obtain explicit Lipschitz and (strong)-monotonicity constants for the regularized operator. These constants ensure last-iterate linear convergence of a single-call Extrapolation-from-the-Past (EFTP) method. Empirical simulations on an academic example show that, even when strong monotonicity cannot be achieved, the asymmetric regularization is enough to converge to an equilibrium and stabilize the trajectory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13920v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automatic Prompt Optimization for Dataset-Level Feature Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13922</link><description>arXiv:2601.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature extraction from unstructured text is a critical step in many downstream classification pipelines, yet current approaches largely rely on hand-crafted prompts or fixed feature schemas. We formulate feature discovery as a dataset-level prompt optimization problem: given a labelled text corpus, the goal is to induce a global set of interpretable and discriminative feature definitions whose realizations optimize a downstream supervised learning objective. To this end, we propose a multi-agent prompt optimization framework in which language-model agents jointly propose feature definitions, extract feature values, and evaluate feature quality using dataset-level performance and interpretability feedback. Instruction prompts are iteratively refined based on this structured feedback, enabling optimization over prompts that induce shared feature sets rather than per-example predictions. This formulation departs from prior prompt optimization methods that rely on per-sample supervision and provides a principled mechanism for automatic feature discovery from unstructured text.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13922v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Effective Negation Modeling in Joint Audio-Text Models for Music</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13931</link><description>arXiv:2601.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint audio-text models are widely used for music retrieval, yet they struggle with semantic phenomena such as negation. Negation is fundamental for distinguishing the absence (or presence) of musical elements (e.g., "with vocals" vs. "without vocals"), but current systems fail to represent this reliably. In this work, we investigate and mitigate this limitation by training CLAP models from scratch on the Million Song Dataset with LP-MusicCaps-MSD captions. We introduce negation through text augmentation and a dissimilarity-based contrastive loss, designed to explicitly separate original and negated captions in the joint embedding space. To evaluate progress, we propose two protocols that frame negation modeling as retrieval and binary classification tasks. Experiments demonstrate that both methods, individually and combined, improve negation handling while largely preserving retrieval performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13931v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VulnResolver: A Hybrid Agent Framework for LLM-Based Automated Vulnerability Issue Resolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13933</link><description>arXiv:2601.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As software systems grow in complexity, security vulnerabilities have become increasingly prevalent, posing serious risks and economic costs. Although automated detection tools such as fuzzers have advanced considerably, effective resolution still often depends on human expertise. Existing automated vulnerability repair (AVR) methods rely heavily on manually provided annotations (e.g., fault locations or CWE labels), which are often difficult and time-consuming to obtain, while overlooking the rich, naturally embedded semantic context found in issue reports from developers.
  In this paper, we present VulnResolver, the first LLM-based hybrid agent framework for automated vulnerability issue resolution. VulnResolver unites the adaptability of autonomous agents with the stability of workflow-guided repair through two specialized agents. The Context Pre-Collection Agent (CPCAgent) adaptively explores the repository to gather dependency and contextual information, while the Safety Property Analysis Agent (SPAAgent) generates and validates the safety properties violated by vulnerabilities. Together, these agents produce structured analyses that enrich the original issue reports, enabling more accurate vulnerability localization and patch generation.
  Evaluations on the SEC-bench benchmark show that VulnResolver resolves 75% of issues on SEC-bench Lite, achieving the best resolution performance. On SEC-bench Full, VulnResolver also significantly outperforms the strongest baseline, the agent-based OpenHands, confirming its effectiveness. Overall, VulnResolver delivers an adaptive and security-aware framework that advances end-to-end automated vulnerability issue resolution through workflow stability and the specialized agents' capabilities in contextual reasoning and property-based analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TrackletGPT: A Language-like GPT Framework for White Matter Tract Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13935</link><description>arXiv:2601.13935v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: As Generative Engines revolutionize information retrieval by synthesizing direct answers from retrieved sources, ensuring source visibility becomes a significant challenge. Improving it through targeted content revisions is a practical strategy termed Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). However, optimizing a document for diverse queries presents a constrained optimization challenge where heterogeneous queries often impose conflicting and competing revision requirements under a limited content budget. To address this challenge, we propose IF-GEO, a "diverge-then-converge" framework comprising two phases: (i) mining distinct optimization preferences from representative latent queries; (ii) synthesizing a Global Revision Blueprint for guided editing by coordinating preferences via conflict-aware instruction fusion. To explicitly quantify IF-GEO's objective of cross-query stability, we introduce risk-aware stability metrics. Experiments on multi-query benchmarks demonstrate that IF-GEO achieves substantial performance gains while maintaining robustness across diverse retrieval scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Glance-or-Gaze: Incentivizing LMMs to Adaptively Focus Search via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13942</link><description>arXiv:2601.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable success in visual understanding, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive queries involving long-tail entities or evolving information due to static parametric knowledge. Recent search-augmented approaches attempt to address this limitation, but existing methods rely on indiscriminate whole-image retrieval that introduces substantial visual redundancy and noise, and lack deep iterative reflection, limiting their effectiveness on complex visual queries. To overcome these challenges, we propose Glance-or-Gaze (GoG), a fully autonomous framework that shifts from passive perception to active visual planning. GoG introduces a Selective Gaze mechanism that dynamically chooses whether to glance at global context or gaze into high-value regions, filtering irrelevant information before retrieval. We design a dual-stage training strategy: Reflective GoG Behavior Alignment via supervised fine-tuning instills the fundamental GoG paradigm, while Complexity-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning further enhances the model's capability to handle complex queries through iterative reasoning. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies confirm that both Selective Gaze and complexity-adaptive RL are essential for effective visual search. We will release our data and models for further exploration soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RepoGenesis: Benchmarking End-to-End Microservice Generation from Readme to Repository</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13943</link><description>arXiv:2601.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models and agents have achieved remarkable progress in code generation. However, existing benchmarks focus on isolated function/class-level generation (e.g., ClassEval) or modifications to existing codebases (e.g., SWE-Bench), neglecting complete microservice repository generation that reflects real-world 0-to-1 development workflows. To bridge this gap, we introduce RepoGenesis, the first multilingual benchmark for repository-level end-to-end web microservice generation, comprising 106 repositories (60 Python, 46 Java) across 18 domains and 11 frameworks, with 1,258 API endpoints and 2,335 test cases verified through a "review-rebuttal" quality assurance process. We evaluate open-source agents (e.g., DeepCode) and commercial IDEs (e.g., Cursor) using Pass@1, API Coverage (AC), and Deployment Success Rate (DSR). Results reveal that despite high AC (up to 73.91%) and DSR (up to 100%), the best-performing system achieves only 23.67% Pass@1 on Python and 21.45% on Java, exposing deficiencies in architectural coherence, dependency management, and cross-file consistency. Notably, GenesisAgent-8B, fine-tuned on RepoGenesis (train), achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 mini, demonstrating the quality of RepoGenesis for advancing microservice generation. We release our benchmark at https://github.com/pzy2000/RepoGenesis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VTONGuard: Automatic Detection and Authentication of AI-Generated Virtual Try-On Content</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13951</link><description>arXiv:2601.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, virtual try-on (VTON) systems are becoming increasingly common in e-commerce and digital entertainment. However, the growing realism of AI-generated try-on content raises pressing concerns about authenticity and responsible use. To address this, we present VTONGuard, a large-scale benchmark dataset containing over 775,000 real and synthetic try-on images. The dataset covers diverse real-world conditions, including variations in pose, background, and garment styles, and provides both authentic and manipulated examples. Based on this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of multiple detection paradigms under unified training and testing protocols. Our results reveal each method's strengths and weaknesses and highlight the persistent challenge of cross-paradigm generalization. To further advance detection, we design a multi-task framework that integrates auxiliary segmentation to enhance boundary-aware feature learning, achieving the best overall performance on VTONGuard. We expect this benchmark to enable fair comparisons, facilitate the development of more robust detection models, and promote the safe and responsible deployment of VTON technologies in practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13951v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differentiable Logic Synthesis: Spectral Coefficient Selection via Sinkhorn-Constrained Composition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13953</link><description>arXiv:2601.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning precise Boolean logic via gradient descent remains challenging: neural networks typically converge to "fuzzy" approximations that degrade under quantization. We introduce Hierarchical Spectral Composition, a differentiable architecture that selects spectral coefficients from a frozen Boolean Fourier basis and composes them via Sinkhorn-constrained routing with column-sign modulation. Our approach draws on recent insights from Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), which demonstrated that projecting routing matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope preserves identity mappings and stabilizes large-scale training. We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.
  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity). (3) For n=4 (10 four-variable operations over 16-dim basis), spectral synthesis -- combining exact Walsh-Hadamard coefficients, ternary quantization, and MCMC refinement with parallel tempering -- achieves 100% accuracy on all operations. This progression establishes (a) that ternary polynomial threshold representations exist for all tested functions, and (b) that finding them requires methods beyond pure gradient descent as dimensionality grows. All operations enable single-cycle combinational logic inference at 10,959 MOps/s on GPU, demonstrating viability for hardware-efficient neuro-symbolic logic synthesis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13953v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DExTeR: Weakly Semi-Supervised Object Detection with Class and Instance Experts for Medical Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13954</link><description>arXiv:2601.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anatomical landmarks in medical imaging is essential for diagnosis and intervention guidance. However, object detection models rely on costly bounding box annotations, limiting scalability. Weakly Semi-Supervised Object Detection (WSSOD) with point annotations proposes annotating each instance with a single point, minimizing annotation time while preserving localization signals. A Point-to-Box teacher model, trained on a small box-labeled subset, converts these point annotations into pseudo-box labels to train a student detector. Yet, medical imagery presents unique challenges, including overlapping anatomy, variable object sizes, and elusive structures, which hinder accurate bounding box inference. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DExTeR (DETR with Experts), a transformer-based Point-to-Box regressor tailored for medical imaging. Built upon Point-DETR, DExTeR encodes single-point annotations as object queries, refining feature extraction with the proposed class-guided deformable attention, which guides attention sampling using point coordinates and class labels to capture class-specific characteristics. To improve discrimination in complex structures, it introduces CLICK-MoE (CLass, Instance, and Common Knowledge Mixture of Experts), decoupling class and instance representations to reduce confusion among adjacent or overlapping instances. Finally, we implement a multi-point training strategy which promotes prediction consistency across different point placements, improving robustness to annotation variability. DExTeR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets spanning different medical domains (endoscopy, chest X-rays, and endoscopic ultrasound) highlighting its potential to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high detection accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13954v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Where to Place a Heavy Payload on a Multirotor UAV for Best Control Performance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13958</link><description>arXiv:2601.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of rigidly attached heavy payload placement - where the payload mass significantly influences the UAV's dynamics - on the stability and control performance of a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In particular, we focus on how the position of such a payload relative to the vehicle's Center of Gravity (CoG) affects the stability and control performance at an arbitrary point of interest on the UAV, such as the payload position, and on how this position can be optimized. Our conclusions are based on two key contributions. First, we analyze the stability of the zero-dynamics of a complete nonlinear model of the UAV with payload. We demonstrate that the stability of the zero dynamics depends on the vertical signed distance in the body-fixed frame between the controlled output position and the combined CoG of the UAV with payload. Specifically, positioning the output below the CoG yields unstable zero dynamics, while the linearized zero dynamics are marginally stable when placing it above, indicating reduced sensitivity to input disturbances. Second, we analyze the performance of the linearized UAV model with payload by providing an analytical expression for the H2-norm, from which we can quantify the system's attenuation to white noise input disturbances. We conclude that less control authority leads to a higher optimal position of the controlled output with respect to the CoG for closed-loop white-noise disturbance rejection capabilities, also when the heavy payload is the controlled output. The results are illustrated through numerical examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13958v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RL-BioAug: Label-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Self-Supervised EEG Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13964</link><description>arXiv:2601.13964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of data augmentation serves as a critical determinant for the performance of contrastive learning in EEG tasks. Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10\%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69\% and 8.80\% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task -- for example, Time Masking with a 62\% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop \&amp; Resize with a 77\% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

Abstract: Retrieving evidence for language model queries from knowledge graphs requires balancing broad search across the graph with multi-hop traversal to follow relational links. Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Transparency Paradox in Explainable AI: A Theory of Autonomy Depletion Through Cognitive Load</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13973</link><description>arXiv:2601.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This paper develops a theoretical framework explaining when and why AI explanations enhance versus impair human decision-making.
  Background: Transparency is advocated as universally beneficial for human-AI interaction, yet identical AI explanations improve decision quality in some contexts but impair it in others. Current theories--trust calibration, cognitive load, and self-determination--cannot fully account for this paradox.
  Method: The framework models autonomy as a continuous stochastic process influenced by information-induced cognitive load. Using stochastic control theory, autonomy evolution is formalized as geometric Brownian motion with information-dependent drift, and optimal transparency is derived via Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Monte Carlo simulations validate theoretical predictions.
  Results: Mathematical analysis generates five testable predictions about disengagement timing, working memory moderation, autonomy trajectory shapes, and optimal information levels. Computational solutions demonstrate that dynamic transparency policies outperform both maximum and minimum transparency by adapting to real-time cognitive state. The optimal policy exhibits threshold structure: provide information when autonomy is high and accumulated load is low; withhold when resources are depleted.
  Conclusion: Transparency effects depend on dynamic cognitive resource depletion rather than static design choices. Information provision triggers metacognitive processing that reduces perceived control when cognitive load exceeds working memory capacity.
  Application: The framework provides design principles for adaptive AI systems: adjust transparency based on real-time cognitive state, implement information budgets respecting capacity limits, and personalize thresholds based on individual working memory capacity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13973v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STEC: A Reference-Free Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage Metric for Evaluating Sampled Video Frames</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13974</link><description>arXiv:2601.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frame sampling is a fundamental component in video understanding and video--language model pipelines, yet evaluating the quality of sampled frames remains challenging. Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content.
  We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality.
  Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding.
  We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13974v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Harmonizing the Deep: A Unified Information Pipeline for Robust Marine Biodiversity Assessment Across Heterogeneous Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13975</link><description>arXiv:2601.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine biodiversity monitoring requires scalability and reliability across complex underwater environments to support conservation and invasive-species management. Yet existing detection solutions often exhibit a pronounced deployment gap, with performance degrading sharply when transferred to new sites. This work establishes the foundational detection layer for a multi-year invasive species monitoring initiative targeting Arctic and Atlantic marine ecosystems. We address this challenge by developing a Unified Information Pipeline that standardises heterogeneous datasets into a comparable information flow and evaluates a fixed, deployment-relevant detector under controlled cross-domain protocols. Across multiple domains, we find that structural factors, such as scene composition, object density, and contextual redundancy, explain cross-domain performance loss more strongly than visual degradation such as turbidity, with sparse scenes inducing a characteristic "Context Collapse" failure mode. We further validate operational feasibility by benchmarking inference on low-cost edge hardware, showing that runtime optimisation enables practical sampling rates for remote monitoring. The results shift emphasis from image enhancement toward structure-aware reliability, providing a democratised tool for consistent marine ecosystem assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13975v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FantasyVLN: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13976</link><description>arXiv:2601.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving human-level performance in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to jointly understand multimodal instructions and visual-spatial context while reasoning over long action sequences. Recent works, such as NavCoT and NavGPT-2, demonstrate the potential of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for improving interpretability and long-horizon planning. Moreover, multimodal extensions like OctoNav-R1 and CoT-VLA further validate CoT as a promising pathway toward human-like navigation reasoning. However, existing approaches face critical drawbacks: purely textual CoTs lack spatial grounding and easily overfit to sparse annotated reasoning steps, while multimodal CoTs incur severe token inflation by generating imagined visual observations, making real-time navigation impractical. In this work, we propose FantasyVLN, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of CoT reasoning without explicit token overhead. Specifically, imagined visual tokens are encoded into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR) during CoT reasoning training, and the model jointly learns from textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy. At inference, our model performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still enjoying reasoning-aware representations. Extensive experiments on LH-VLN show that our approach achieves reasoning-aware yet real-time navigation, improving success rates and efficiency while reducing inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to explicit CoT methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13976v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active Cross-Modal Visuo-Tactile Perception of Deformable Linear Objects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13979</link><description>arXiv:2601.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel cross-modal visuo-tactile perception framework for the 3D shape reconstruction of deformable linear objects (DLOs), with a specific focus on cables subject to severe visual occlusions. Unlike existing methods relying predominantly on vision, whose performance degrades under varying illumination, background clutter, or partial visibility, the proposed approach integrates foundation-model-based visual perception with adaptive tactile exploration. The visual pipeline exploits SAM for instance segmentation and Florence for semantic refinement, followed by skeletonization, endpoint detection, and point-cloud extraction. Occluded cable segments are autonomously identified and explored with a tactile sensor, which provides local point clouds that are merged with the visual data through Euclidean clustering and topology-preserving fusion. A B-spline interpolation driven by endpoint-guided point sorting yields a smooth and complete reconstruction of the cable shape. Experimental validation using a robotic manipulator equipped with an RGB-D camera and a tactile pad demonstrates that the proposed framework accurately reconstructs both simple and highly curved single or multiple cable configurations, even when large portions are occluded. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model-enhanced cross-modal perception for advancing robotic manipulation of deformable objects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13979v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VirtualCrime: Evaluating Criminal Potential of Large Language Models via Sandbox Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13981</link><description>arXiv:2601.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in multi-step decision-making, planning and actions, and are increasingly integrated into various real-world applications. It is concerning whether their strong problem-solving abilities may be misused for crimes. To address this gap, we propose VirtualCrime, a sandbox simulation framework based on a three-agent system to evaluate the criminal capabilities of models. Specifically, this framework consists of an attacker agent acting as the leader of a criminal team, a judge agent determining the outcome of each action, and a world manager agent updating the environment state and entities. Furthermore, we design 40 diverse crime tasks within this framework, covering 11 maps and 13 crime objectives such as theft, robbery, kidnapping, and riot. We also introduce a human player baseline for reference to better interpret the performance of LLM agents. We evaluate 8 strong LLMs and find (1) All agents in the simulation environment compliantly generate detailed plans and execute intelligent crime processes, with some achieving relatively high success rates; (2) In some cases, agents take severe action that inflicts harm to NPCs to achieve their goals. Our work highlights the need for safety alignment when deploying agentic AI in real-world settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13981v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Equivariant Learning for Unsupervised Image Dehazing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13986</link><description>arXiv:2601.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Dehazing (ID) aims to produce a clear image from an observation contaminated by haze. Current ID methods typically rely on carefully crafted priors or extensive haze-free ground truth, both of which are expensive or impractical to acquire, particularly in the context of scientific imaging. We propose a new unsupervised learning framework called Equivariant Image Dehazing (EID) that exploits the symmetry of image signals to restore clarity to hazy observations. By enforcing haze consistency and systematic equivariance, EID can recover clear patterns directly from raw, hazy images. Additionally, we propose an adversarial learning strategy to model unknown haze physics and facilitate EID learning. Experiments on two scientific image dehazing benchmarks (including cell microscopy and medical endoscopy) and on natural image dehazing have demonstrated that EID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. By unifying equivariant learning with modelling haze physics, we hope that EID will enable more versatile and effective haze removal in scientific imaging. Code and datasets will be published.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A universal linearized subspace refinement framework for neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13989</link><description>arXiv:2601.13989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are predominantly trained using gradient-based methods, yet in many applications their final predictions remain far from the accuracy attainable within the model's expressive capacity. We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy. By bridging nonlinear neural representations with reduced-order linear solvers at fixed linearization points, LSR provides a numerically grounded and broadly applicable refinement framework for supervised learning, operator learning, and scientific computing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13989v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generating Functions Meet Occupation Measures: Invariant Synthesis for Probabilistic Loops (Extended Version)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13991</link><description>arXiv:2601.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental computational task in probabilistic programming is to infer a program's output (posterior) distribution from a given initial (prior) distribution. This problem is challenging, especially for expressive languages that feature loops or unbounded recursion. While most of the existing literature focuses on statistical approximation, in this paper we address the problem of mathematically exact inference.
  To achieve this for programs with loops, we rely on a relatively underexplored type of probabilistic loop invariant, which is linked to a loop's so-called occupation measure. The occupation measure associates program states with their expected number of visits, given the initial distribution. Based on this, we derive the notion of an occupation invariant. Such invariants are essentially dual to probabilistic martingales, the predominant technique for formal probabilistic loop analysis in the literature. A key feature of occupation invariants is that they can take the initial distribution into account and often yield a proof of positive almost sure termination as a by-product.
  Finally, we present an automatic, template-based invariant synthesis approach for occupation invariants by encoding them as generating functions. The approach is implemented and evaluated on a set of benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "The Whole Is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts": A Compatibility-Aware Multi-Teacher CoT Distillation Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13992</link><description>arXiv:2601.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable capabilities but typically requires prohibitive parameter scales. CoT distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm to transfer reasoning prowess into compact Student Models (SLMs), but existing approaches often rely on a solitary teacher, capping the student's potential since individual LLMs often exhibit distinct capability biases and may suffer from catastrophic forgetting. While leveraging diverse teachers seems appealing, effectively fusing their supervisions remains challenging: teacher-student incompatibility risks amplifying hallucinations, and passive supervision fails to ensure genuine logic internalization. To address this, we introduce COMPACT, a framework that adaptively fuses supervisions from different teachers by dynamically weighting teacher gradients based on the student's real-time compatibility evaluated by a multi-dimensional metric: (1) Graph-based Consensus to filter misleading rationales by identifying mainstream reasoning paths; (2) Mutual-Information-based Adaptability to detect "epiphany moments" for genuinely understanding the reasoning process rather than merely imitating; and (3) Loss-based Difficulty to assess student receptivity to the teacher's guidance and prevent negative transfer. Extensive experiments and latent space analysis demonstrate that COMPACT effectively integrates diverse reasoning capabilities without damaging the model's original knowledge structure, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13992v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Capacity and Energy Trade-Offs in FR3 6G Networks Using Real Deployment Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13993</link><description>arXiv:2601.13993v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Effective and controllable data selection is critical for LLM instruction tuning, especially with massive open-source datasets. Existing approaches primarily rely on instance-level quality scores, or diversity metrics based on embedding clusters or semantic tags. However, constrained by the flatness of embedding spaces or the coarseness of tags, these approaches overlook fine-grained knowledge and its intrinsic hierarchical dependencies, consequently hindering precise data valuation and knowledge-aligned sampling. To address this challenge, we propose Tree-aware Aligned Global Sampling (TAGS), a unified framework that leverages a knowledge tree built from fine-grained tags, thereby enabling joint control of global quality, diversity, and target alignment. Using an LLM-based tagger, we extract atomic knowledge concepts, which are organized into a global tree through bottom-up hierarchical clustering. By grounding data instances onto this tree, a tree-aware metric then quantifies data quality and diversity, facilitating effective sampling. Our controllable sampling strategy maximizes tree-level information gain and enforces leaf-level alignment via KL-divergence for specific domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, it surpasses the full-dataset model by \textbf{+5.84\%} using only \textbf{5\%} of the data, while our aligned sampling strategy further boosts average performance by \textbf{+4.24\%}.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13995v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Group-Invariant Unsupervised Skill Discovery: Symmetry-aware Skill Representations for Generalizable Behavior</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14000</link><description>arXiv:2601.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to acquire behavior primitives that improve exploration and accelerate downstream task learning. However, existing approaches often ignore the geometric symmetries of physical environments, leading to redundant behaviors and sample inefficiency. To address this, we introduce Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), a framework that explicitly embeds group structure into the skill discovery objective. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations. Experiments on state-based and pixel-based locomotion benchmarks demonstrate that GISD achieves broader state-space coverage and improved efficiency in downstream task learning compared to a strong baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Auditory Brain Passage Retrieval: Cross-Sensory EEG Training for Neural Information Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14001</link><description>arXiv:2601.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query formulation from internal information needs remains fundamentally challenging across all Information Retrieval paradigms due to cognitive complexity and physical impairments. Brain Passage Retrieval (BPR) addresses this by directly mapping EEG signals to passage representations without intermediate text translation. However, existing BPR research exclusively uses visual stimuli, leaving critical questions unanswered: Can auditory EEG enable effective retrieval for voice-based interfaces and visually impaired users? Can training on combined EEG datasets from different sensory modalities improve performance despite severe data scarcity? We present the first systematic investigation of auditory EEG for BPR and evaluate cross-sensory training benefits. Using dual encoder architectures with four pooling strategies (CLS, mean, max, multi-vector), we conduct controlled experiments comparing auditory-only, visual-only, and combined training on the Alice (auditory) and Nieuwland (visual) datasets. Results demonstrate that auditory EEG consistently outperforms visual EEG, and cross-sensory training with CLS pooling achieves substantial improvements over individual training: 31% in MRR (0.474), 43% in Hit@1 (0.314), and 28% in Hit@10 (0.858). Critically, combined auditory EEG models surpass BM25 text baselines (MRR: 0.474 vs 0.428), establishing neural queries as competitive with traditional retrieval whilst enabling accessible interfaces. These findings validate auditory neural interfaces for IR tasks and demonstrate that cross-sensory training addresses data scarcity whilst outperforming single-modality approaches Code: https://github.com/NiallMcguire/Audio_BPR</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Consensus Stability of Community Notes on X</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14002</link><description>arXiv:2601.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community-based fact-checking systems, such as Community Notes on X (formerly Twitter), aim to mitigate online misinformation by surfacing annotations judged helpful by contributors with diverse viewpoints. While prior work has shown that the platform's bridging-based algorithm effectively selects helpful notes at the time of display, little is known about how evaluations change after notes become visible. Using a large-scale dataset of 437,396 community notes and 35 million ratings from over 580,000 contributors, we examine the stability of helpful notes and the rating dynamics that follow their initial display. We find that 30.2% of displayed notes later lose their helpful status and disappear. Using interrupted time series models, we further show that note display triggers a sharp increase in rating volume and a significant shift in rating leaning, but these effects differ across rater groups. Contributors with viewpoints similar to note authors tend to increase supportive ratings, while dissimilar contributors increase negative ratings, producing systematic post-display polarization. Counterfactual analyses suggest that this post-display polarization, particularly from dissimilar raters, plays a substantial role in note disappearance. These findings highlight the vulnerability of consensus-based fact-checking systems to polarized rating behavior and suggest pathways for improving their resilience.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Locate, Steer, and Improve: A Practical Survey of Actionable Mechanistic Interpretability in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14004</link><description>arXiv:2601.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has emerged as a vital approach to demystify the opaque decision-making of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing reviews primarily treat MI as an observational science, summarizing analytical insights while lacking a systematic framework for actionable intervention. To bridge this gap, we present a practical survey structured around the pipeline: "Locate, Steer, and Improve." We formally categorize Localizing (diagnosis) and Steering (intervention) methods based on specific Interpretable Objects to establish a rigorous intervention protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this framework enables tangible improvements in Alignment, Capability, and Efficiency, effectively operationalizing MI as an actionable methodology for model optimization.

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) genuinely understand abstract concepts, or merely manipulate them as statistical patterns? We introduce an abstraction-grounding framework that decomposes conceptual understanding into three capacities: interpretation of abstract concepts (Abstract-Abstract, A-A), grounding of abstractions in concrete events (Abstract-Concrete, A-C), and application of abstract principles to regulate concrete decisions (Concrete-Concrete, C-C). Using human values as a testbed - given their semantic richness and centrality to alignment - we employ probing (detecting value traces in internal activations) and steering (modifying representations to shift behavior). Across six open-source LLMs and ten value dimensions, probing shows that diagnostic probes trained solely on abstract value descriptions reliably detect the same values in concrete event narratives and decision reasoning, demonstrating cross-level transfer. Steering reveals an asymmetry: intervening on value representations causally shifts concrete judgments and decisions (A-C, C-C), yet leaves abstract interpretations unchanged (A-A), suggesting that encoded abstract values function as stable anchors rather than malleable activations. These findings indicate LLMs maintain structured value representations that bridge abstraction and action, providing a mechanistic and operational foundation for building value-driven autonomous AI systems with more transparent, generalizable alignment and control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MANATEE: A DevOps Platform for xApp Lifecycle Management and Testing in Open RAN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14009</link><description>arXiv:2601.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift to disaggregated 5G architectures introduces unprecedented flexibility but also significant complexity in Beyond 5G Radio Access Networks (RANs). Open RAN enables programmability through xApps, yet deploying and validating these applications is critical given the nature of the systems they aim to control. Current Open RAN ecosystems lack robust lifecycle management of xApps that enable automated testing, seamless migration, and production-grade observability, resulting in slow, error-prone xApp delivery. To address these issues, DevOps practices can streamline the xApp lifecycle by integrating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with advanced traffic management and monitoring, such as leveraging service mesh technologies to enable progressive deployment strategies (e.g., canary releases and A/B testing) to ensure fine-grained observability and resilience. The solution presented in this article, MANATEE (Mesh Architecture for Radio Access Network Automation and TEsting Ecosystems), is the first platform that combines these principles to simplify xApp delivery into production, accelerate innovation, and guarantee performance across heterogeneous O-RAN environments. We prototyped MANATEE on a Kubernetes cluster integrated with the O-RAN Software Community Near-Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), as well as with service mesh technologies, to facilitate testing of xApps across simulated, emulated, and real testbed environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that service mesh integration introduces minimal overhead (below 1 ms latency), while enabling reliable canary deployments with fine-grained traffic control and conflict-free A/B testing through circuit-breaking mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14009v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BallotRank: A Condorcet Completion Method for Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14015</link><description>arXiv:2601.14015v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce chemical functions, a unified framework that models chemical systems as noisy challenge--response primitives, and formalize the associated chemical function infrastructure. Building on the theory of physical functions, we rigorously define robustness, unclonability, and unpredictability for chemical functions in both finite and asymptotic regimes, and specify security games that capture the adversary's power and the security goals. We instantiate the framework with two existing DNA-based constructions (operable random DNA and Genomic Sequence Encryption) and derive quantitative bounds for robustness, unclonability, and unpredictability. Our analysis develops maximum-likelihood verification rules under sequencing noise and partial-edit models, and provides high-precision estimates based on binomial distributions to guide parameter selection. The framework, definitions, and analyses yield a reproducible methodology for designing chemically unclonable authentication mechanisms. We demonstrate applications to in-product authentication and to shared key generation using standard extraction techniques.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OAMAC: Origin-Aware Mandatory Access Control for Practical Post-Compromise Attack Surface Reduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14021</link><description>arXiv:2601.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern operating systems provide powerful mandatory access control mechanisms, yet they largely reason about who executes code rather than how execution originates. As a result, processes launched remotely, locally, or by background services are often treated equivalently once privileges are obtained, complicating security reasoning and enabling post-compromise abuse of sensitive system interfaces. We introduce origin-aware mandatory access control (OAMAC), a kernel-level enforcement model that treats execution origin -- such as physical user presence, remote access, or service execution -- as a first-class security attribute. OAMAC mediates access to security-critical subsystems based on execution provenance rather than identity alone, enabling centralized governance over multiple attack surfaces while significantly reducing policy complexity. We present a deployable prototype implemented entirely using the Linux eBPF LSM framework, requiring no kernel modifications. OAMAC classifies execution origin using kernel-visible metadata, propagates origin across process creation, and enforces origin-aware policies on both sensitive filesystem interfaces and the kernel BPF control plane. Policies are maintained in kernel-resident eBPF maps and can be reconfigured at runtime via a minimal userspace tool. Our evaluation demonstrates that OAMAC effectively restricts common post-compromise actions available to remote attackers while preserving normal local administration and system stability. We argue that execution origin represents a missing abstraction in contemporary operating system security models, and that elevating it to a first-class concept enables practical attack surface reduction without requiring subsystem-specific expertise or heavyweight security frameworks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14021v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Credible CO2 Comparisons: A Machine Learning Approach to Vehicle Powertrain Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14022</link><description>arXiv:2601.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonizing road transport requires consistent and transparent methods for comparing CO2 emissions across vehicle technologies. This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for like-for-like operational assessment of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) under identical, real-world driving conditions. The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universal Approximation Theorem for Input-Connected Multilayer Perceptrons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14026</link><description>arXiv:2601.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Input-Connected Multilayer Perceptron (IC-MLP), a feedforward neural network architecture in which each hidden neuron receives, in addition to the outputs of the preceding layer, a direct affine connection from the raw input. We first study this architecture in the univariate setting and give an explicit and systematic description of IC-MLPs with an arbitrary finite number of hidden layers, including iterated formulas for the network functions. In this setting, we prove a universal approximation theorem showing that deep IC-MLPs can approximate any continuous function on a closed interval of the real line if and only if the activation function is nonlinear. We then extend the analysis to vector-valued inputs and establish a corresponding universal approximation theorem for continuous functions on compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Numina-Lean-Agent: An Open and General Agentic Reasoning System for Formal Mathematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14027</link><description>arXiv:2601.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic systems have recently become the dominant paradigm for formal theorem proving, achieving strong performance by coordinating multiple models and tools. However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system. Beyond benchmark evaluation, we further demonstrate its generality by interacting with mathematicians to successfully formalize the Brascamp-Lieb theorem.

Abstract: Diffusion models are the current state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems in imaging. Their impressive generative capability allows them to approximate sampling from a prior distribution, which alongside a known likelihood function permits posterior sampling without retraining the model. While recent methods have made strides in advancing the accuracy of posterior sampling, the majority focuses on single-image inverse problems. However, for modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is common to acquire multiple complementary measurements, each low-resolution along a different axis. In this work, we generalize common diffusion-based inverse single-image problem solvers for multi-image super-resolution (MISR) MRI. We show that the DPS likelihood correction allows an exactly-separable gradient decomposition across independently acquired measurements, enabling MISR without constructing a joint operator, modifying the diffusion model, or increasing network function evaluations. We derive MISR versions of DPS, DMAP, DPPS, and diffusion-based PnP/ADMM, and demonstrate substantial gains over SISR across $4\times/8\times/16\times$ anisotropic degradations. Our results achieve state-of-the-art super-resolution of anisotropic MRI volumes and, critically, enable reconstruction of near-isotropic anatomy from routine 2D multi-slice acquisitions, which are otherwise highly degraded in orthogonal views.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14030v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RM-Distiller: Exploiting Generative LLM for Reward Model Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14032</link><description>arXiv:2601.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Due to the difficulty of obtaining high-quality human preference annotations, distilling preferences from generative LLMs has emerged as a standard practice. However, existing approaches predominantly treat teacher models as simple binary annotators, failing to fully exploit the rich knowledge and capabilities for RM distillation. To address this, we propose RM-Distiller, a framework designed to systematically exploit the multifaceted capabilities of teacher LLMs: (1) Refinement capability, which synthesizes highly correlated response pairs to create fine-grained and contrastive signals. (2) Scoring capability, which guides the RM in capturing precise preference strength via a margin-aware optimization objective. (3) Generation capability, which incorporates the teacher's generative distribution to regularize the RM to preserve its fundamental linguistic knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RM-Distiller significantly outperforms traditional distillation methods both on RM benchmarks and reinforcement learning-based alignment, proving that exploiting multifaceted teacher capabilities is critical for effective reward modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic research on RM distillation from generative LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14032v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PAC-Private Responses with Adversarial Composition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14033</link><description>arXiv:2601.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are increasingly deployed behind APIs. This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.
  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.
  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14033v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analyzing the Availability of E-Mail Addresses for PyPI Libraries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14034</link><description>arXiv:2601.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) libraries form the backbone of modern software systems, yet their long-term sustainability often depends on maintainers being reachable for support, coordination, and security reporting. In this paper, we empirically analyze the availability of contact information - specifically e-mail addresses - across 686,034 Python libraries on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and their associated GitHub repositories. We examine how and where maintainers provide this information, assess its validity, and explore coverage across individual libraries and their dependency chains. Our findings show that 81.6% of libraries include at least one valid e-mail address, with PyPI serving as the primary source (79.5%). When analyzing dependency chains, we observe that up to 97.8% of direct and 97.7% of transitive dependencies provide valid contact information. At the same time, we identify over 698,000 invalid entries, primarily due to missing fields. These results demonstrate strong maintainer reachability across the ecosystem, while highlighting opportunities for improvement - such as offering clearer guidance to maintainers during the packaging process and introducing opt-in validation mechanisms for existing e-mail addresses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human detectors are surprisingly powerful reward models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14037</link><description>arXiv:2601.14037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual fidelity and temporal coherence. Yet, they continue to struggle with complex, non-rigid motions, especially when synthesizing humans performing dynamic actions such as sports, dance, etc. Generated videos often exhibit missing or extra limbs, distorted poses, or physically implausible actions. In this work, we propose a remarkably simple reward model, HuDA, to quantify and improve the human motion in generated videos. HuDA integrates human detection confidence for appearance quality, and a temporal prompt alignment score to capture motion realism. We show this simple reward function that leverages off-the-shelf models without any additional training, outperforms specialized models finetuned with manually annotated data. Using HuDA for Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) post-training of video models, we significantly enhance video generation, especially when generating complex human motions, outperforming state-of-the-art models like Wan 2.1, with win-rate of 73%. Finally, we demonstrate that HuDA improves generation quality beyond just humans, for instance, significantly improving generation of animal videos and human-object interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Correcting and Quantifying Systematic Errors in 3D Box Annotations for Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14038</link><description>arXiv:2601.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate ground truth annotations are critical to supervised learning and evaluating the performance of autonomous vehicle systems. These vehicles are typically equipped with active sensors, such as LiDAR, which scan the environment in predefined patterns. 3D box annotation based on data from such sensors is challenging in dynamic scenarios, where objects are observed at different timestamps, hence different positions. Without proper handling of this phenomenon, systematic errors are prone to being introduced in the box annotations. Our work is the first to discover such annotation errors in widely used, publicly available datasets. Through our novel offline estimation method, we correct the annotations so that they follow physically feasible trajectories and achieve spatial and temporal consistency with the sensor data. For the first time, we define metrics for this problem; and we evaluate our method on the Argoverse 2, MAN TruckScenes, and our proprietary datasets. Our approach increases the quality of box annotations by more than 17% in these datasets. Furthermore, we quantify the annotation errors in them and find that the original annotations are misplaced by up to 2.5 m, with highly dynamic objects being the most affected. Finally, we test the impact of the errors in benchmarking and find that the impact is larger than the improvements that state-of-the-art methods typically achieve with respect to the previous state-of-the-art methods; showing that accurate annotations are essential for correct interpretation of performance.

While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behaviour, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels. This work establishes that enabling models to selectively ignore corrupted samples is a powerful and generalizable strategy for building more reliable segmentation models.

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) is currently defined by auto-regressive (AR) architectures, which generate text through a sequential ``brick-by-brick'' process. Despite their success, AR models are inherently constrained by a causal bottleneck that limits global structural foresight and iterative refinement. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a transformative alternative, conceptualizing text generation as a holistic, bidirectional denoising process akin to a sculptor refining a masterpiece. However, the potential of DLMs remains largely untapped as they are frequently confined within AR-legacy infrastructures and optimization frameworks. In this Perspective, we identify ten fundamental challenges ranging from architectural inertia and gradient sparsity to the limitations of linear reasoning that prevent DLMs from reaching their ``GPT-4 moment''. We propose a strategic roadmap organized into four pillars: foundational infrastructure, algorithmic optimization, cognitive reasoning, and unified multimodal intelligence. By shifting toward a diffusion-native ecosystem characterized by multi-scale tokenization, active remasking, and latent thinking, we can move beyond the constraints of the causal horizon. We argue that this transition is essential for developing next-generation AI capable of complex structural reasoning, dynamic self-correction, and seamless multimodal integration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Balanced Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14042</link><description>arXiv:2601.14042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a paradigm of joint learning in which clients collaborate by sharing model parameters instead of data. However, in the non-iid setting, the global model experiences client drift, which can seriously affect the final performance of the model. Previous methods tend to correct the global model that has already deviated based on the loss function or gradient, overlooking the impact of the client samples. In this paper, we rethink the role of the client side and propose Federated Balanced Learning, i.e., FBL, to prevent this issue from the beginning through sample balance on the client side. Technically, FBL allows unbalanced data on the client side to achieve sample balance through knowledge filling and knowledge sampling using edge-side generation models, under the limitation of a fixed number of data samples on clients. Furthermore, we design a Knowledge Alignment Strategy to bridge the gap between synthetic and real data, and a Knowledge Drop Strategy to regularize our method. Meanwhile, we scale our method to real and complex scenarios, allowing different clients to adopt various methods, and extend our framework to further improve performance. Numerous experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The code is released upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weather-R1: Logically Consistent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Multimodal Reasoning in Meteorology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14044</link><description>arXiv:2601.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) show advancing reasoning capabilities, their application in meteorology is constrained by a domain gap and a reasoning faithfulness gap. Specifically, mainstream Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) can induce Self-Contradictory Reasoning (Self-Contra), where the model's reasoning contradicts its final answer, which is unacceptable in such a high-stakes domain. To address these challenges, we construct WeatherQA, a novel multimodal reasoning benchmark in meteorology. We also propose Logically Consistent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (LoCo-RFT), which resolves Self-Contra by introducing a logical consistency reward. Furthermore, we introduce Weather-R1, the first reasoning VLM with logical faithfulness in meteorology, to the best of our knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that Weather-R1 improves performance on WeatherQA by 9.8 percentage points over the baseline, outperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning and RFT, and even surpassing the original Qwen2.5-VL-32B. These results highlight the effectiveness of our LoCo-RFT and the superiority of Weather-R1.

Abstract: Suppose we need a deep collective analysis of an open scientific problem: there is a complex scientific hypothesis and a large online group of mutually unrelated experts with relevant private information of a diverse and unpredictable nature. This information may be results of experts' individual experiments, original reasoning of some of them, results of AI systems they use, etc. We propose a simple mechanism based on a self-resolving play-money prediction market entangled with a chat. We show that such a system can easily be brought to an equilibrium where participants directly share their private information on the hypothesis through the chat and trade as if the market were resolved in accordance with the truth of the hypothesis. This approach will lead to efficient aggregation of relevant information in a completely interpretable form even if the ground truth cannot be established and experts initially know nothing about each other and cannot perform complex Bayesian calculations. Finally, by rewarding the experts with some real assets proportionally to the play money they end up with, we can get an innovative way to fund large-scale collaborative studies of any type.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Multilingualism in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs: Routing Mechanism, Expert Specialization, and Layerwise Steering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14050</link><description>arXiv:2601.14050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have shown strong multilingual capabilities, yet the internal mechanisms underlying performance gains and cross-language differences remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of MoE models, examining routing behavior and expert specialization across languages and network depth. Our analysis reveals that multilingual processing in MoE models is highly structured: routing aligns with linguistic families, expert utilization follows a clear layerwise pattern, and high-resource languages rely on shared experts while low-resource languages depend more on language-exclusive experts despite weaker performance. Layerwise interventions further show that early and late MoE layers support language-specific processing, whereas middle layers serve as language-agnostic capacity hubs. Building on these insights, we propose a routing-guided steering method that adaptively guides routing behavior in middle layers toward shared experts associated with dominant languages at inference time, leading to consistent multilingual performance improvements, particularly for linguistically related language pairs.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task that has garnered significant attention. The emergence of CLIP has spurred extensive research into zero-shot OOD detection, often employing a training-free approach. Current methods leverage expert knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to identify potential outliers. However, these approaches tend to over-rely on knowledge in the text space, neglecting the inherent challenges involved in detecting out-of-distribution samples in the image space. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline, MM-OOD, which leverages the multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs and their ability to conduct multi-round conversations for enhanced outlier detection. Our method is designed to improve performance in both near OOD and far OOD tasks. Specifically, (1) for near OOD tasks, we directly feed ID images and corresponding text prompts into MLLMs to identify potential outliers; and (2) for far OOD tasks, we introduce the sketch-generate-elaborate framework: first, we sketch outlier exposure using text prompts, then generate corresponding visual OOD samples, and finally elaborate by using multimodal prompts. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements on widely used multimodal datasets such as Food-101, while also validating its scalability on ImageNet-1K.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14052v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMOrbit: A Circular Taxonomy of Large Language Models -From Scaling Walls to Agentic AI Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14053</link><description>arXiv:2601.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence has undergone a revolution from foundational Transformer architectures to reasoning-capable systems approaching human-level performance. We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at &lt;$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%). We provide insights into techniques (RLHF, PPO, DPO, GRPO, ORPO), trace evolution from passive generation to tool-using agents (ReAct, RAG, multi-agent systems), and analyze post-training innovations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14053v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SecureSplit: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Split Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14054</link><description>arXiv:2601.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split Learning (SL) offers a framework for collaborative model training that respects data privacy by allowing participants to share the same dataset while maintaining distinct feature sets. However, SL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which malicious clients subtly alter their embeddings to insert hidden triggers that compromise the final trained model. To address this vulnerability, we introduce SecureSplit, a defense mechanism tailored to SL. SecureSplit applies a dimensionality transformation strategy to accentuate subtle differences between benign and poisoned embeddings, facilitating their separation. With this enhanced distinction, we develop an adaptive filtering approach that uses a majority-based voting scheme to remove contaminated embeddings while preserving clean ones. Rigorous experiments across four datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, CINIC-10, and ImageNette), five backdoor attack scenarios, and seven alternative defenses confirm the effectiveness of SecureSplit under various challenging conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoder-Free Supervoxel GNN for Accurate Brain-Tumor Localization in Multi-Modal MRI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14055</link><description>arXiv:2601.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vision backbones for 3D medical imaging typically process dense voxel grids through parameter-heavy encoder-decoder structures, a design that allocates a significant portion of its parameters to spatial reconstruction rather than feature learning. Our approach introduces SVGFormer, a decoder-free pipeline built upon a content-aware grouping stage that partitions the volume into a semantic graph of supervoxels. Its hierarchical encoder learns rich node representations by combining a patch-level Transformer with a supervoxel-level Graph Attention Network, jointly modeling fine-grained intra-region features and broader inter-regional dependencies. This design concentrates all learnable capacity on feature encoding and provides inherent, dual-scale explainability from the patch to the region level. To validate the framework's flexibility, we trained two specialized models on the BraTS dataset: one for node-level classification and one for tumor proportion regression. Both models achieved strong performance, with the classification model achieving a F1-score of 0.875 and the regression model a MAE of 0.028, confirming the encoder's ability to learn discriminative and localized features. Our results establish that a graph-based, encoder-only paradigm offers an accurate and inherently interpretable alternative for 3D medical image representation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14055v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] POCI-Diff: Position Objects Consistently and Interactively with 3D-Layout Guided Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14056</link><description>arXiv:2601.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a diffusion-based approach for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation with consistent and interactive 3D layout control and editing. While prior methods improve spatial adherence using 2D cues or iterative copy-warp-paste strategies, they often distort object geometry and fail to preserve consistency across edits. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework for Positioning Objects Consistently and Interactively (POCI-Diff), a novel formulation for jointly enforcing 3D geometric constraints and instance-level semantic binding within a unified diffusion process. Our method enables explicit per-object semantic control by binding individual text descriptions to specific 3D bounding boxes through Blended Latent Diffusion, allowing one-shot synthesis of complex multi-object scenes. We further propose a warping-free generative editing pipeline that supports object insertion, removal, and transformation via regeneration rather than pixel deformation. To preserve object identity and consistency across edits, we condition the diffusion process on reference images using IP-Adapter, enabling coherent object appearance throughout interactive 3D editing while maintaining global scene coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that POCI-Diff produces high-quality images consistent with the specified 3D layouts and edits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and layout adherence while eliminating warping-induced geometric artifacts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Verifying Floating-Point Programs in Stainless</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14059</link><description>arXiv:2601.14059v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) is a rapidly growing area with significant practical applications, allowing users to retrieve a target image by providing a reference image and a relative caption describing the desired modifications. Existing ZS-CIR methods often struggle to capture fine-grained changes and integrate visual and semantic information effectively. They primarily rely on either transforming the multimodal query into a single text using image-to-text models or employing large language models for target image description generation, approaches that often fail to capture complementary visual information and complete semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval method with Complementary Visual-Semantic Integration (CVSI). Specifically, CVSI leverages three key components: (1) Visual Information Extraction, which not only extracts global image features but also uses a pre-trained mapping network to convert the image into a pseudo token, combining it with the modification text and the objects most likely to be added. (2) Semantic Information Extraction, which involves using a pre-trained captioning model to generate multiple captions for the reference image, followed by leveraging an LLM to generate the modified captions and the objects most likely to be added. (3) Complementary Information Retrieval, which integrates information extracted from both the query and database images to retrieve the target image, enabling the system to efficiently handle retrieval queries in a variety of situations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (e.g., CIRR, CIRCO, and FashionIQ) demonstrate that CVSI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cross-cultural competence in large language models (LLMs) requires the ability to identify Culture-Specific Items (CSIs) and to adapt them appropriately across cultural contexts. Progress in evaluating this capability has been constrained by the scarcity of high-quality CSI-annotated corpora with parallel cross-cultural sentence pairs. To address this limitation, we introduce XCR-Bench, a Cross(X)-Cultural Reasoning Benchmark consisting of 4.9k parallel sentences and 1,098 unique CSIs, spanning three distinct reasoning tasks with corresponding evaluation metrics. Our corpus integrates Newmark's CSI framework with Hall's Triad of Culture, enabling systematic analysis of cultural reasoning beyond surface-level artifacts and into semi-visible and invisible cultural elements such as social norms, beliefs, and values. Our findings show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit consistent weaknesses in identifying and adapting CSIs related to social etiquette and cultural reference. Additionally, we find evidence that LLMs encode regional and ethno-religious biases even within a single linguistic setting during cultural adaptation. We release our corpus and code to facilitate future research on cross-cultural NLP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VERIDAH: Solving Enumeration Anomaly Aware Vertebra Labeling across Imaging Sequences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14066</link><description>arXiv:2601.14066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human spine commonly consists of seven cervical, twelve thoracic, and five lumbar vertebrae. However, enumeration anomalies may result in individuals having eleven or thirteen thoracic vertebrae and four or six lumbar vertebrae. Although the identification of enumeration anomalies has potential clinical implications for chronic back pain and operation planning, the thoracolumbar junction is often poorly assessed and rarely described in clinical reports. Additionally, even though multiple deep-learning-based vertebra labeling algorithms exist, there is a lack of methods to automatically label enumeration anomalies. Our work closes that gap by introducing "Vertebra Identification with Anomaly Handling" (VERIDAH), a novel vertebra labeling algorithm based on multiple classification heads combined with a weighted vertebra sequence prediction algorithm. We show that our approach surpasses existing models on T2w TSE sagittal (98.30% vs. 94.24% of subjects with all vertebrae correctly labeled, p &lt; 0.001) and CT imaging (99.18% vs. 77.26% of subjects with all vertebrae correctly labeled, p &lt; 0.001) and works in arbitrary field-of-view images. VERIDAH correctly labeled the presence 2 M\"oller et al. of thoracic enumeration anomalies in 87.80% and 96.30% of T2w and CT images, respectively, and lumbar enumeration anomalies in 94.48% and 97.22% for T2w and CT, respectively.

Abstract: Infinite-state games provide a framework for the synthesis of reactive systems with unbounded data domains. Solving such games typically relies on computing symbolic fixpoints, particularly symbolic attractors. However, these computations may not terminate, and while recent acceleration techniques have been proposed to address this issue, they often rely on acceleration arguments of limited expressiveness. In this work, we propose an approach for the modular computation of acceleration arguments. It enables the construction of complex acceleration arguments by composing simpler ones, thereby improving both scalability and flexibility. In addition, we introduce a summarization technique that generalizes discovered acceleration arguments, allowing them to be efficiently reused across multiple contexts. Together, these contributions improve the efficiency of solving infinite-state games in reactive synthesis, as demonstrated by our experimental evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the optimal shape parameter for kernel methods: Sharp direct and inverse statements</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14070</link><description>arXiv:2601.14070v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Query-based sampling has become an increasingly popular technique for monitoring Markov sources in pull-based update systems.

In this work, we relax both of these assumptions and find optimal sampling policies for monitoring continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) under generic delay distributions. In particular, we show that one can obtain significant gains in terms of mean binary freshness (MBF) by employing a waiting based strategy for query-based sampling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14075v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Trees to Tree-Like: Distribution and Synthesis for Asynchronous Automata</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14078</link><description>arXiv:2601.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit constructions for distribution and synthesis of Zielonka's asynchronous automata in restricted settings. We show first a simple, quadratic, distribution construction for asynchronous automata, where the process architecture is tree-like. An architecture is tree-like if there is an underlying spanning tree of the architecture and communications are local on the tree. This quadratic distribution result generalizes the known construction for tree architectures and improves on an older, exponential construction for triangulated dependence alphabets. Lastly we consider the problem of distributed controller synthesis and show that it is decidable for tree-like architectures. This extends the decidability boundary from tree architectures to tree-like keeping the same $\text{Tower}_d(n)$ complexity bound, where $n$ is the size of the system and $d \ge 0$ the depth of the process tree.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14078v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VENI: Variational Encoder for Natural Illumination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14079</link><description>arXiv:2601.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse rendering is an ill-posed problem, but priors like illumination priors, can simplify it. Existing work either disregards the spherical and rotation-equivariant nature of illumination environments or does not provide a well-behaved latent space. We propose a rotation-equivariant variational autoencoder that models natural illumination on the sphere without relying on 2D projections. To preserve the SO(2)-equivariance of environment maps, we use a novel Vector Neuron Vision Transformer (VN-ViT) as encoder and a rotation-equivariant conditional neural field as decoder. In the encoder, we reduce the equivariance from SO(3) to SO(2) using a novel SO(2)-equivariant fully connected layer, an extension of Vector Neurons. We show that our SO(2)-equivariant fully connected layer outperforms standard Vector Neurons when used in our SO(2)-equivariant model. Compared to previous methods, our variational autoencoder enables smoother interpolation in latent space and offers a more well-behaved latent space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14079v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feature-Aware Test Generation for Deep Learning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14081</link><description>arXiv:2601.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep learning models are widely used in software systems, test generation plays a crucial role in assessing the quality of such models before deployment. To date, the most advanced test generators rely on generative AI to synthesize inputs; however, these approaches remain limited in providing semantic insight into the causes of misbehaviours and in offering fine-grained semantic controllability over the generated inputs. In this paper, we introduce Detect, a feature-aware test generation framework for vision-based deep learning (DL) models that systematically generates inputs by perturbing disentangled semantic attributes within the latent space. Detect perturbs individual latent features in a controlled way and observes how these changes affect the model's output. Through this process, it identifies which features lead to behavior shifts and uses a vision-language model for semantic attribution. By distinguishing between task-relevant and irrelevant features, Detect applies feature-aware perturbations targeted for both generalization and robustness. Empirical results across image classification and detection tasks show that Detect generates high-quality test cases with fine-grained control, reveals distinct shortcut behaviors across model architectures (convolutional and transformer-based), and bugs that are not captured by accuracy metrics. Specifically, Detect outperforms a state-of-the-art test generator in decision boundary discovery and a leading spurious feature localization method in identifying robustness failures. Our findings show that fully fine-tuned convolutional models are prone to overfitting on localized cues, such as co-occurring visual traits, while weakly supervised transformers tend to rely on global features, such as environmental variances. These findings highlight the value of interpretable and feature-aware testing in improving DL model reliability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14081v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DermaBench: A Clinician-Annotated Benchmark Dataset for Dermatology Visual Question Answering and Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14084</link><description>arXiv:2601.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly important in medical applications; however, their evaluation in dermatology remains limited by datasets that focus primarily on image-level classification tasks such as lesion recognition. While valuable for recognition, such datasets cannot assess the full visual understanding, language grounding, and clinical reasoning capabilities of multimodal models. Visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks are required to evaluate how models interpret dermatological images, reason over fine-grained morphology, and generate clinically meaningful descriptions. We introduce DermaBench, a clinician-annotated dermatology VQA benchmark built on the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset. DermaBench comprises 656 clinical images from 570 unique patients spanning Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI. Using a hierarchical annotation schema with 22 main questions (single-choice, multi-choice, and open-ended), expert dermatologists annotated each image for diagnosis, anatomic site, lesion morphology, distribution, surface features, color, and image quality, together with open-ended narrative descriptions and summaries, yielding approximately 14.474 VQA-style annotations. DermaBench is released as a metadata-only dataset to respect upstream licensing and is publicly available at Harvard Dataverse.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14084v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Two-Stream temporal transformer for video action classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14086</link><description>arXiv:2601.14086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion representation plays an important role in video understanding and has many applications including action recognition, robot and autonomous guidance or others.

In this study, we introduce a new two-stream transformer video classifier, which extracts spatio-temporal information from content and optical flow representing movement information.

Abstract: Motivated by DNA storage systems and 3D fingerprinting, this work studies the adversarial torn paper channel with edit errors. This channel first applies at most $t_e$ edit errors (i.e., insertions, deletions, and substitutions) to the transmitted word and then breaks it into $t+1$ fragments at arbitrary positions. In this paper, we construct a near optimal error correcting code for this channel, which will be referred to as a $t$-breaks $t_e$-edit-errors resilient code. This code enables reconstructing the transmitted codeword from the $t+1$ noisy fragments. Moreover, we study list decoding of the torn paper channel by deriving bounds on the size of the list (of codewords) obtained from cutting a codeword of a $t$-breaks resilient code $t'$ times, where $t' &gt; t$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14088v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-Driven Safe Output Regulation of Strict-Feedback Linear Systems with Input Delay</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14089</link><description>arXiv:2601.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven safe control framework for linear systems possessing a known strict-feedback structure, but with most plant parameters, external disturbances, and input delay being unknown. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, we utilize Krylov dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract the system dynamics from measured data, enabling the reconstruction of the system and disturbance matrices. Concurrently, the batch least-squares identification (BaLSI) method is employed to identify other unknown parameters in the input channel. Using control barrier functions (CBFs) and backstepping, we first develop a full-state safe controller. Based on this, we build an output-feedback controller by performing system identification using only the output data and actuation signals as well as constructing an observer to estimate the unmeasured plant states. The proposed approach achieves: 1) finite-time identification of a substantial set of unknown system quantities, and 2) exponential convergence of the output state (the state furthest from the control input) to a reference trajectory while rigorously ensuring safety constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a safe vehicle platooning application.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-shot adaptable task planning for autonomous construction robots: a comparative study of lightweight single and multi-AI agent systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14091</link><description>arXiv:2601.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots are expected to play a major role in the future construction industry but face challenges due to high costs and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. This study explores the potential of foundation models to enhance the adaptability and generalizability of task planning in construction robots. Four models are proposed and implemented using lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). These models include one single agent and three multi-agent teams that collaborate to create robot action plans. The models are evaluated across three construction roles: Painter, Safety Inspector, and Floor Tiling. Results show that the four-agent team outperforms the state-of-the-art GPT-4o in most metrics while being ten times more cost-effective. Additionally, teams with three and four agents demonstrate the improved generalizability. By discussing how agent behaviors influence outputs, this study enhances the understanding of AI teams and supports future research in diverse unstructured environments beyond construction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimizing Energy and Data Collection in UAV-aided IoT Networks using Attention-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14092</link><description>arXiv:2601.14092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their adaptability and mobility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly essential for wireless network services, particularly for data harvesting tasks. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches have gained significant attention for addressing UAV path planning tasks in large and complex environments, bridging the gap with real-world deployments. However, many existing algorithms suffer from limited training data, which hampers their performance in highly dynamic environments. Moreover, they often overlook the inherently multi-objective nature of the task, treating it in an overly simplistic manner. To address these limitations, we propose an attention-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) architecture that explicitly handles the trade-off between data collection and energy consumption in urban environments, even without prior knowledge of wireless channel conditions. Our method develops a single model capable of adapting to varying trade-off preferences and dynamic scenario parameters without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. Extensive simulations show that our approach achieves substantial improvements in performance, model compactness, sample efficiency, and most importantly, generalization to previously unseen scenarios, outperforming existing RL solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14092v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Remapping and navigation of an embedding space via error minimization: a fundamental organizational principle of cognition in natural and artificial systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14096</link><description>arXiv:2601.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of diverse intelligence seeks an integrated view of problem-solving in agents of very different provenance, composition, and substrates. From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition. Recognizing this shared mechanism not only illuminates deep parallels between living systems and artificial models, but also provides a unifying framework for engineering adaptive intelligence across scales.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A flexible language model-assisted electronic design automation framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14098</link><description>arXiv:2601.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming electronic design automation (EDA) by enhancing design stages such as schematic design, simulation, netlist synthesis, and place-and-route. Existing methods primarily focus these optimisations within isolated open-source EDA tools and often lack the flexibility to handle multiple domains, such as analogue, digital, and radio-frequency design. In contrast, modern systems require to interface with commercial EDA environments, adhere to tool-specific operation rules, and incorporate feedback from design outcomes while supporting diverse design flows. We propose a versatile framework that uses LLMs to generate files compatible with commercial EDA tools and optimise designs using power-performance-area reports. This is accomplished by guiding the LLMs with tool constraints and feedback from design outputs to meet tool requirements and user specifications. Case studies on operational transconductance amplifiers, microstrip patch antennas, and FPGA circuits show that the framework is effective as an EDA-aware assistant, handling diverse design challenges reliably.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14098v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal feature selection framework for stable soft sensor modeling based on time-delayed cross mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14099</link><description>arXiv:2601.14099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft sensor modeling plays a crucial role in process monitoring. Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dirge1/TDPCM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14099v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Curriculum-Based Strategies for Efficient Cross-Domain Action Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14101</link><description>arXiv:2601.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in human action recognition, generalizing to diverse viewpoints remains a challenge. Most existing datasets are captured from ground-level perspectives, and models trained on them often struggle to transfer to drastically different domains such as aerial views. This paper examines how curriculum-based training strategies can improve generalization to unseen real aerial-view data without using any real aerial data during training.
  We explore curriculum learning for cross-view action recognition using two out-of-domain sources: synthetic aerial-view data and real ground-view data. Our results on the evaluation on order of training (fine-tuning on synthetic aerial data vs. real ground data) shows that fine-tuning on real ground data but differ in how they transition from synthetic to real. The first uses a two-stage curriculum with direct fine-tuning, while the second applies a progressive curriculum that expands the dataset in multiple stages before fine-tuning. We evaluate both methods on the REMAG dataset using SlowFast (CNN-based) and MViTv2 (Transformer-based) architectures.
  Results show that combining the two out-of-domain datasets clearly outperforms training on a single domain, whether real ground-view or synthetic aerial-view. Both curriculum strategies match the top-1 accuracy of simple dataset combination while offering efficiency gains. With the two-step fine-tuning method, SlowFast achieves up to a 37% reduction in iterations and MViTv2 up to a 30% reduction compared to simple combination. The multi-step progressive approach further reduces iterations, by up to 9% for SlowFast and 30% for MViTv2, relative to the two-step method. These findings demonstrate that curriculum-based training can maintain comparable performance (top-1 accuracy within 3% range) while improving training efficiency in cross-view action recognition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14101v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interp3D: Correspondence-aware Interpolation for Generative Textured 3D Morphing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14103</link><description>arXiv:2601.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textured 3D morphing seeks to generate smooth and plausible transitions between two 3D assets, preserving both structural coherence and fine-grained appearance. This ability is crucial not only for advancing 3D generation research but also for practical applications in animation, editing, and digital content creation. Existing approaches either operate directly on geometry, limiting them to shape-only morphing while neglecting textures, or extend 2D interpolation strategies into 3D, which often causes semantic ambiguity, structural misalignment, and texture blurring. These challenges underscore the necessity to jointly preserve geometric consistency, texture alignment, and robustness throughout the transition process. To address this, we propose Interp3D, a novel training-free framework for textured 3D morphing. It harnesses generative priors and adopts a progressive alignment principle to ensure both geometric fidelity and texture coherence. Starting from semantically aligned interpolation in condition space, Interp3D enforces structural consistency via SLAT (Structured Latent)-guided structure interpolation, and finally transfers appearance details through fine-grained texture fusion. For comprehensive evaluations, we construct a dedicated dataset, Interp3DData, with graded difficulty levels and assess generation results from fidelity, transition smoothness, and plausibility. Both quantitative metrics and human studies demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed approach over previous methods.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed hidden malicious behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL) policies and activate them using triggers at test time. Most existing attacks are validated only in simulation, while their effectiveness in real-world robotic systems remains unclear. In physical deployment, safety-constrained control pipelines such as velocity limiting, action smoothing, and collision avoidance suppress abnormal actions, causing strong attenuation of conventional backdoor attacks. We study this previously overlooked problem and propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) for real-world RL. We design small printable visual patch triggers placed on the floor and generate them using a conditional diffusion model that produces diverse patch appearances under real-world visual variations. We treat the robot control stack as a black-box system. We further introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that injects triggers only at decision-critical training states. We evaluate our method on a TurtleBot3 mobile robot and demonstrate reliable activation of targeted attacks while preserving normal task performance.

Contrary to prior hypothesis that community-produced debunks rely more heavily on subjective or persuasive wording, we find no evidence that CNs contain a higher average number of persuasion techniques than professional fact-checks. We additionally identify systematic rhetorical differences between CNs and professional debunking efforts, reflecting differences in institutional norms and topical coverage. Finally, we examine how the crowd evaluates persuasive language in CNs and show that, although notes with more persuasive elements receive slightly higher overall helpfulness ratings, crowd raters are effective at penalising the use of particular problematic rhetorical means</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14105v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Communication Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems: From Railways to UAVs and Beyond</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14106</link><description>arXiv:2601.14106v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Adversary emulation tools facilitate scripting and automated execution of cyber attack chains, thereby reducing costs and manual expert effort required for security testing, cyber exercises, and intrusion detection research. However, due to the fact that existing tools typically rely on agents installed on target systems, they leave suspicious traces that make it easy to distinguish their activities from those of real human attackers. Moreover, these tools often lack relevant capabilities, such as handling of interactive prompts, and are unsuitable for emulating specific stages of the kill chain, such as initial access. This paper thus introduces AttackMate, an open-source attack scripting language and execution engine designed to mimic behavior patterns of actual attackers. We validate the tool in a case study covering common attack steps including privilege escalation, information gathering, and lateral movement. Our results indicate that log artifacts resulting from AttackMate's activities resemble those produced by human attackers more closely than those generated by standard adversary emulation tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14108v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TLSQL: Table Learning Structured Query Language</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14109</link><description>arXiv:2601.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table learning, which lies at the intersection of machine learning and modern database systems, has recently attracted growing attention. However, existing frameworks typically require explicit data export and extensive feature engineering, creating a high barrier for database practitioners. We present TLSQL (Table Learning Structured Query Language), a system that enables table learning directly over relational databases via SQL-like declarative specifications. TLSQL is implemented as a lightweight Python library that translates these specifications into standard SQL queries and structured learning task descriptions. The generated SQL queries are executed natively by the database engine, while the task descriptions are consumed by downstream table learning frameworks. This design allows users to focus on modeling and analysis rather than low-level data preparation and pipeline orchestration. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TLSQL effectively lowers the barrier to integrating machine learning into databasecentric workflows.

Abstract: Few-shot learning aims to identify novel categories from only a handful of labeled samples, where prototypes estimated from scarce data are often biased and generalize poorly. Semantic-based methods alleviate this by introducing coarse class-level information, but they are mostly applied on the support side, leaving query representations unchanged. In this paper, we present PMCE, a Probabilistic few-shot framework that leverages Multi-granularity semantics with Caption-guided Enhancement. PMCE constructs a nonparametric knowledge bank that stores visual statistics for each category as well as CLIP-encoded class name embeddings of the base classes. At meta-test time, the most relevant base classes are retrieved based on the similarities of class name embeddings for each novel category. These statistics are then aggregated into category-specific prior information and fused with the support set prototypes via a simple MAP update. Simultaneously, a frozen BLIP captioner provides label-free instance-level image descriptions, and a lightweight enhancer trained on base classes optimizes both support prototypes and query features under an inductive protocol with a consistency regularization to stabilize noisy captions. Experiments on four benchmarks show that PMCE consistently improves over strong baselines, achieving up to 7.71% absolute gain over the strongest semantic competitor on MiniImageNet in the 1-shot setting.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become critical as transformer-based models are deployed in high-stakes applications including healthcare, legal systems, and financial services, where opacity hinders trust and accountability. Transformers self-attention mechanisms have proven valuable for model interpretability, with attention weights successfully used to understand model focus and behavior (Xu et al., 2015); (Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019). However, existing attention-based explanation methods rely on manually defined aggregation strategies and fixed attribution rules (Abnar and Zuidema, 2020a); (Chefer et al., 2021), while model-agnostic approaches (LIME, SHAP) treat the model as a black box and incur significant computational costs through input perturbation. We introduce Explanation Network (ExpNet), a lightweight neural network that learns an explicit mapping from transformer attention patterns to token-level importance scores. Unlike prior methods, ExpNet discovers optimal attention feature combinations automatically rather than relying on predetermined rules. We evaluate ExpNet in a challenging cross-task setting and benchmark it against a broad spectrum of model-agnostic methods and attention-based techniques spanning four methodological families.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Partial Reductions for Kleene Algebra with Linear Hypotheses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14114</link><description>arXiv:2601.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kleene algebra (KA) is an important tool for reasoning about general program equivalences, with a decidable and complete equational theory. However, KA cannot always prove equivalences between specific programs. For this purpose, one adds hypotheses to KA that encode program-specific knowledge. Traditionally, a map on regular expressions called a reduction then lets us lift decidability and completeness to these more expressive systems. Explicitly constructing such a reduction requires significant labour. Moreover, due to regularity constraints, a reduction may not exist for all combinations of expression and hypothesis.
  We describe an automaton-based construction to mechanically derive reductions for a wide class of hypotheses. These reductions can be partial, in which case they yield partial completeness: completeness for expressions in their domain. This allows us to automatically establish the provability of more equivalences than what is covered in existing work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14115</link><description>arXiv:2601.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid Time-Constant networks (LTCs), a type of continuous-time graph neural network, excel at modeling irregularly-sampled dynamics but are fundamentally confined to Euclidean space. This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Abstract: Identifying when and where a news image was taken is crucial for journalists and forensic experts to produce credible stories and debunk misinformation. While many existing methods rely on reverse image search (RIS) engines, these tools often fail to return results, thereby limiting their practical applicability. In this work, we address the challenging scenario where RIS evidence is unavailable. We introduce NewsRECON, a method that links images to relevant news articles to infer their date and location from article metadata. NewsRECON leverages a corpus of over 90,000 articles and integrates: (1) a bi-encoder for retrieving event-relevant articles; (2) two cross-encoders for reranking articles by location and event consistency. Experiments on the TARA and 5Pils-OOC show that NewsRECON outperforms prior work and can be combined with a multimodal large language model to achieve new SOTA results in the absence of RIS evidence. We make our code available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14121v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Systematic Analysis of Chunking Strategies for Reliable Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14123</link><description>arXiv:2601.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how document chunking choices impact the reliability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in industry. While practice often relies on heuristics, our end-to-end evaluation on Natural Questions systematically varies chunking method (token, sentence, semantic, code), chunk size, overlap, and context length. We use a standard industrial setup: SPLADE retrieval and a Mistral-8B generator. We derive actionable lessons for cost-efficient deployment: (i) overlap provides no measurable benefit and increases indexing cost; (ii) sentence chunking is the most cost-effective method, matching semantic chunking up to ~5k tokens; (iii) a "context cliff" reduces quality beyond ~2.5k tokens; and (iv) optimal context depends on the goal (semantic quality peaks at small contexts; exact match at larger ones).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Style Transfer as Bias Mitigation: Diffusion Models for Synthetic Mental Health Text for Arabic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14124</link><description>arXiv:2601.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution for mitigating data scarcity and demographic bias in mental health analysis, yet existing approaches largely rely on pretrained large language models (LLMs), which may suffer from limited output diversity and propagate biases inherited from their training data. In this work, we propose a pretraining-free diffusion-based approach for synthetic text generation that frames bias mitigation as a style transfer problem. Using the CARMA Arabic mental health corpus, which exhibits a substantial gender imbalance, we focus on male-to-female style transfer to augment underrepresented female-authored content. We construct five datasets capturing varying linguistic and semantic aspects of gender expression in Arabic and train separate diffusion models for each setting. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate consistently high semantic fidelity between source and generated text, alongside meaningful surface-level stylistic divergence, while qualitative analysis confirms linguistically plausible gender transformations. Our results show that diffusion-based style transfer can generate high-entropy, semantically faithful synthetic data without reliance on pretrained LLMs, providing an effective and flexible framework for mitigating gender bias in sensitive, low-resource mental health domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Side Effects of Being Smart: Safety Risks in MLLMs' Multi-Image Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14127</link><description>arXiv:2601.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) acquire stronger reasoning capabilities to handle complex, multi-image instructions, this advancement may pose new safety risks. We study this problem by introducing MIR-SafetyBench, the first benchmark focused on multi-image reasoning safety, which consists of 2,676 instances across a taxonomy of 9 multi-image relations. Our extensive evaluations on 19 MLLMs reveal a troubling trend: models with more advanced multi-image reasoning can be more vulnerable on MIR-SafetyBench. Beyond attack success rates, we find that many responses labeled as safe are superficial, often driven by misunderstanding or evasive, non-committal replies. We further observe that unsafe generations exhibit lower attention entropy than safe ones on average. This internal signature suggests a possible risk that models may over-focus on task solving while neglecting safety constraints.

Abstract: Perception in granular media remains challenging due to unpredictable particle dynamics. To address this challenge, we present SandWorm, a biomimetic screw-actuated robot augmented by peristaltic motion to enhance locomotion, and SWTac, a novel event-based visuotactile sensor with an actively vibrated elastomer. The event camera is mechanically decoupled from vibrations by a spring isolation mechanism, enabling high-quality tactile imaging of both dynamic and stationary objects. For algorithm design, we propose an IMU-guided temporal filter to enhance imaging consistency, improving MSNR by 24%. Moreover, we systematically optimize SWTac with vibration parameters, event camera settings and elastomer properties. Motivated by asymmetric edge features, we also implement contact surface estimation by U-Net. Experimental validation demonstrates SWTac's 0.2 mm texture resolution, 98% stone classification accuracy, and 0.15 N force estimation error, while SandWorm demonstrates versatile locomotion (up to 12.5 mm/s) in challenging terrains, successfully executes pipeline dredging and subsurface exploration in complex granular media (observed 90% success rate). Field experiments further confirm the system's practical performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14128v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Range as a Key" is the Key! Fast and Compact Cloud Block Store Index with RASK</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14129</link><description>arXiv:2601.14129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cloud block store, indexing is on the critical path of I/O operations and typically resides in memory. With the scaling of users and the emergence of denser storage media, the index has become a primary memory consumer, causing memory strain. Our extensive analysis of production traces reveals that write requests exhibit a strong tendency to target continuous block ranges in cloud storage systems. Thus, compared to current per-block indexing, our insight is that we should directly index block ranges (i.e., range-as-a-key) to save memory.
  In this paper, we propose RASK, a memory-efficient and high-performance tree-structured index that natively indexes ranges. While range-as-a-key offers the potential to save memory and improve performance, realizing this idea is challenging due to the range overlap and range fragmentation issues. To handle range overlap efficiently, RASK introduces the log-structured leaf, combined with range-tailored search and garbage collection. To reduce range fragmentation, RASK employs range-aware split and merge mechanisms. Our evaluations on four production traces show that RASK reduces memory footprint by up to 98.9% and increases throughput by up to 31.0x compared to ten state-of-the-art indexes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14129v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GIC-DLC: Differentiable Logic Circuits for Hardware-Friendly Grayscale Image Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14130</link><description>arXiv:2601.14130v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: As mobile applications (apps) become ubiquitous in everyday life, it is crucial for developers to prioritize accessibility for users with diverse abilities. While previous research has identified widespread accessibility issues and raised awareness of developer challenges, there remains a lack of cross-platform, globally representative insights into how practitioners approach accessibility in practice. This paper presents findings from a mixed-methods survey of 110 mobile app developers across 43 countries, examining how platform ecosystems (iOS vs. Android) and developer experience shape accessibility practices. Results show that while developers recognize the importance of accessibility, they often rely on platform-specific guidelines and typically perform compliance testing late in the development process. Developers primarily implement text-focused features while struggling with API limitations and organizational constraints. Through systematic cross-platform comparison, we identify novel platform-specific barriers and demonstrate how accessibility practices differ across developer experience levels. Our findings offer new insights into the challenges of achieving accessibility in practice and provide actionable steps for various stakeholders to promote more consistent and inclusive app development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward self-coding information systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14132</link><description>arXiv:2601.14132v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Standard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically fine-tune a monolithic Vision-Language Model (VLM) backbone explicitly for robotic control. However, this approach creates a critical tension between maintaining high-level general semantic understanding and learning low-level, fine-grained sensorimotor skills, often leading to "catastrophic forgetting" of the model's open-world capabilities. To resolve this conflict, we introduce TwinBrainVLA, a novel architecture that coordinates a generalist VLM retaining universal semantic understanding and a specialist VLM dedicated to embodied proprioception for joint robotic control. TwinBrainVLA synergizes a frozen "Left Brain", which retains robust general visual reasoning, with a trainable "Right Brain", specialized for embodied perception, via a novel Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism. This design allows the Right Brain to dynamically query semantic knowledge from the frozen Left Brain and fuse it with proprioceptive states, providing rich conditioning for a Flow-Matching Action Expert to generate precise continuous controls. Extensive experiments on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that TwinBrainVLA achieves superior manipulation performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while explicitly preserving the comprehensive visual understanding capabilities of the pre-trained VLM, offering a promising direction for building general-purpose robots that simultaneously achieve high-level semantic understanding and low-level physical dexterity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CREATE: Cross-Layer Resilience Characterization and Optimization for Efficient yet Reliable Embodied AI Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14140</link><description>arXiv:2601.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently attracted significant attention as it bridges AI with the physical world. Modern embodied AI systems often combine a Large Language Model (LLM)-based planner for high-level task planning and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller for low-level action generation, enabling embodied agents to tackle complex tasks in real-world environments. However, deploying embodied agents remains challenging due to their high computation requirements, especially for battery-powered local devices. Although techniques like lowering operating voltage can improve energy efficiency, they can introduce bit errors and result in task failures. In this work, we propose CREATE, a general design principle that leverages heterogeneous resilience at different layers for synergistic energy-reliability co-optimization. For the first time, we conduct a comprehensive error injection study on modern embodied AI systems and observe an inherent but heterogeneous fault tolerance. Building upon these insights, we develop an anomaly detection and clearance mechanism at the circuit level to eliminate outlier errors. At the model level, we propose a weight-rotation-enhanced planning algorithm to improve the fault tolerance of the LLM-based planner. Furthermore, we introduce an application-level technique, autonomy-adaptive voltage scaling, to dynamically adjust the operating voltage of the controllers. The voltage scaling circuit is co-designed to enable online voltage adjustment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that without compromising task quality, CREATE achieves 40.6% computational energy savings on average over nominal-voltage baselines and 35.0% over prior-art techniques. This further leads to 29.5% to 37.3% chip-level energy savings and approximately a 15% to 30% improvement in battery life.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14140v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vector Coded Caching Multiplicatively Boosts MU-MIMO Systems Under Practical Considerations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14142</link><description>arXiv:2601.14142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a first comprehensive analysis of the impact of vector coded caching (VCC) in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems with multiple receive antennas and variable pathloss -- two key factors that critically influence systems with inherent MU unicasting behavior. We investigate two widely adopted precoding strategies: (i) blockdiagonalization (BD) at the transmitter combined with maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receivers, and (ii) zero-forcing (ZF) precoding. Our analysis explicitly accounts for practical considerations such as channel fading, channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead, and fairness-oriented power allocation.
  Our contributions span both analytical and simulation-based fronts. On the analytical side, we derive analytical expressions for the achievable throughput under BD-MRC and ZF, highlighting the performance benefits of equipping multi-antenna users with cache-aided interference management. Specifically, we develop a low-complexity BD-MRC optimization method that leverages matrix structure to significantly reduce the dimensionality involved in precoding computation, followed by solving the associated maxmin fairness problem through an efficient one-dimensional search. In the massive MIMO regime, an asymptotic expression for the achievable throughput over Rayleigh fading channels is also derived. Simulations validate our theoretical results, confirming that VCC delivers substantial performance gains over optimized cacheless MU-MIMO systems. For example, with 32 transmit antennas and 2 receive antennas per user, VCC yields throughput improvements exceeding 300%. These gains are further amplified under imperfect CSI at the transmitter, where VCC's ability to offload interference mitigation to the receivers ensures robust performance even in the face of degraded CSI quality and elevated acquisition costs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Quest for Reliable AI Accelerators: Cross-Layer Evaluation and Design Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14148</link><description>arXiv:2601.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the CMOS technology pushes to the nanoscale, aging effects and process variations have become increasingly pronounced, posing significant reliability challenges for AI accelerators. Traditional guardband-based design approaches, which rely on pessimistic timing margin, sacrifice significant performance and computational efficiency, rendering them inadequate for high-performance AI computing demands. Current reliability-aware AI accelerator design faces two core challenges: (1) the lack of systematic cross-layer analysis tools to capture coupling reliability effects across device, circuit, architecture, and application layers; and (2) the fundamental trade-off between conventional reliability optimization and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper systematically presents a series of reliability-aware accelerator designs, encompassing (1) aging and variation-aware dynamic timing analyzer, (2) accelerator dataflow optimization using critical input pattern reduction, and (3) resilience characterization and novel architecture design for large language models (LLMs). By tightly integrating cross-layer reliability modeling and AI workload characteristics, these co-optimization approaches effectively achieve reliable and efficient AI acceleration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14148v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lost in the Prompt Order: Revealing the Limitations of Causal Attention in Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14152</link><description>arXiv:2601.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit surprising sensitivity to the structure of the prompt, but the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity remain poorly understood.

Through systematic architectural analysis, we identify causal attention as the core mechanism: in QOC prompts, the causal mask prevents option tokens from attending to context, creating an information bottleneck where context becomes invisible to options.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14152v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM Augmented Intervenable Multimodal Adaptor for Post-operative Complication Prediction in Lung Cancer Surgery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14154</link><description>arXiv:2601.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postoperative complications remain a critical concern in clinical practice, adversely affecting patient outcomes and contributing to rising healthcare costs.

MIRACLE employs a hyperspherical embedding space fusion of heterogeneous inputs, enabling the extraction of robust, discriminative features from both structured clinical records and high-dimensional radiological images. To enhance transparency of prediction and clinical utility, we incorporate an interventional deep learning module in MIRACLE, that not only refines predictions but also provides interpretable and actionable insights, allowing domain experts to interactively adjust recommendations based on clinical expertise. We validate our approach on POC-L, a real-world dataset comprising 3,094 lung cancer patients who underwent surgery at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Abstract: As heterogeneous supercomputing architectures leveraging GPUs become increasingly central to high-performance computing (HPC), it is crucial for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, a de-facto HPC workload, to efficiently utilize such hardware. One of the key challenges of HPC codes is performance portability, i.e. the ability to maintain near-optimal performance across different accelerators. In the context of the \textbf{REFMAP} project, which targets scalable, GPU-enabled multi-fidelity CFD for urban airflow prediction, this paper analyzes the performance portability of SOD2D, a state-of-the-art Spectral Elements simulation framework across AMD and NVIDIA GPU architectures. We first discuss the physical and numerical models underlying SOD2D, highlighting its computational hotspots. Then, we examine its performance and scalability in a multi-level manner, i.e. defining and characterizing an extensive full-stack design space spanning across application, software and hardware infrastructure related parameters. Single-GPU performance characterization across server-grade NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures and vendor-specific compiler stacks, show the potential as well as the diverse effect of memory access optimizations, i.e. 0.69$\times$ - 3.91$\times$ deviations in acceleration speedup. Performance variability of SOD2D at scale is further examined on the LUMI multi-GPU cluster, where profiling reveals similar throughput variations, highlighting the limits of performance projections and the need for multi-level, informed tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14159v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Domain-Adaptation through Synthetic Data: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for German Law</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14160</link><description>arXiv:2601.14160v1 Announce Type: new

Using rigorous automated filtering methods and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, we demonstrate that LLMs adapted with our synthetic dataset significantly outperform their baseline counterparts on German legal question answering tasks. Our results highlight the feasibility of using carefully designed synthetic data as a robust alternative to manual annotation in high-stakes, knowledge-intensive domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14160v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One-Shot Refiner: Boosting Feed-forward Novel View Synthesis via One-Step Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14161</link><description>arXiv:2601.14161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse images, addressing key limitations in recent feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods built on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones. While ViT-based pipelines offer strong geometric priors, they are often constrained by low-resolution inputs due to computational costs. Moreover, existing generative enhancement methods tend to be 3D-agnostic, resulting in inconsistent structures across views, especially in unseen regions. To overcome these challenges, we design a Dual-Domain Detail Perception Module, which enables handling high-resolution images without being limited by the ViT backbone, and endows Gaussians with additional features to store high-frequency details. We develop a feature-guided diffusion network, which can preserve high-frequency details during the restoration process. We introduce a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of the ViT-based geometric backbone and the diffusion-based refinement module. Experiments demonstrate that our method can maintain superior generation quality across multiple datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14161v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Empirical Study on Remote Code Execution in Machine Learning Model Hosting Ecosystems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14163</link><description>arXiv:2601.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-sharing platforms, such as Hugging Face, ModelScope, and OpenCSG, have become central to modern machine learning development, enabling developers to share, load, and fine-tune pre-trained models with minimal effort. However, the flexibility of these ecosystems introduces a critical security concern: the execution of untrusted code during model loading (i.e., via trust_remote_code or trust_repo). In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of custom model loading practices across five major model-sharing platforms to assess their prevalence, associated risks, and developer perceptions. We first quantify the frequency with which models require custom code to function and identify those that execute arbitrary Python files during loading. We then apply three complementary static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, and Semgrep, to detect security smells and potential vulnerabilities, categorizing our findings by CWE identifiers to provide a standardized risk taxonomy. We also use YARA to identify malicious patterns and payload signatures. In parallel, we systematically analyze the documentation, API design, and safety mechanisms of each platform to understand their mitigation strategies and enforcement levels. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of over 600 developer discussions from GitHub, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Hub forums, as well as Stack Overflow, to capture community concerns and misconceptions regarding security and usability. Our findings reveal widespread reliance on unsafe defaults, uneven security enforcement across platforms, and persistent confusion among developers about the implications of executing remote code. We conclude with actionable recommendations for designing safer model-sharing infrastructures and striking a balance between usability and security in future AI ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14163v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Impact of Interference Cognition on the Reliability and Capacity of Industrial Wireless Communications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14164</link><description>arXiv:2601.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference significantly impacts the performance of industrial wireless networks, particularly n severe interference environments with dense networks reusing spectrum resources intensively. Although delicate interference information is often unavailable in conventional networks, emerging interference cognition techniques can compensate this critical problem with possibly different precision. This paper investigates the relationship between precision of interference cognition and system performance. We propose a novel performance analysis framework that quantifies the impact of varying interference information precision on achievable rate.
  Specifically, leveraging the Nakagami-$\mathbf{m}$ fading channel model, we analytically and asymptotically analyze the average achievable rate in the finite blocklength regime for different precision levels of signal and interference information. Our findings reveal the critical importance of identifying per-link interference information for achieving optimal performance. Additionally, obtaining instantaneous information is more beneficial for signal links.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14164v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ASBA: A-line State Space Model and B-line Attention for Sparse Optical Doppler Tomography Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14165</link><description>arXiv:2601.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Doppler Tomography (ODT) is an emerging blood flow analysis technique. A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is generated by sequentially acquiring 1D depth-resolved raw A-scans (A-line) along the lateral axis (B-line), followed by Doppler phase-subtraction analysis. To ensure high-fidelity B-scan images, current practices rely on dense sampling, which prolongs scanning time, increases storage demands, and limits the capture of rapid blood flow dynamics. Recent studies have explored sparse sampling of raw A-scans to alleviate these limitations, but their effectiveness is hindered by the conservative sampling rates and the uniform modeling of flow and background signals. In this study, we introduce a novel blood flow-aware network, named ASBA (A-line ROI State space model and B-line phase Attention), to reconstruct ODT images from highly sparsely sampled raw A-scans. Specifically, we propose an A-line ROI state space model to extract sparsely distributed flow features along the A-line, and a B-line phase attention to capture long-range flow signals along each B-line based on phase difference. Moreover, we introduce a flow-aware weighted loss function that encourages the network to prioritize the accurate reconstruction of flow signals. Extensive experiments on real animal data demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14165v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Paper2Rebuttal: A Multi-Agent Framework for Transparent Author Response Assistance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14171</link><description>arXiv:2601.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Writing effective rebuttals is a high-stakes task that demands more than linguistic fluency, as it requires precise alignment between reviewer intent and manuscript details. Current solutions typically treat this as a direct-to-text generation problem, suffering from hallucination, overlooked critiques, and a lack of verifiable grounding. To address these limitations, we introduce $\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$, the first multi-agents framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task. Our system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text while integrating an autonomous and on-demand external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, $\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$ ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence. We validate our approach on the proposed $\textbf{RebuttalBench}$ and demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms strong baselines in coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence, offering a transparent and controllable assistant for the peer review process. Code will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14171v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human Values in a Single Sentence: Moral Presence, Hierarchies, and Transformer Ensembles on the Schwartz Continuum</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14172</link><description>arXiv:2601.14172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sentence-level identification of the 19 values in the Schwartz motivational continuum as a concrete formulation of human value detection in text. The setting - out-of-context sentences from news and political manifestos - features sparse moral cues and severe class imbalance. This combination makes fine-grained sentence-level value detection intrinsically difficult, even for strong modern neural models. We first operationalize a binary moral presence task ("does any value appear?") and show that it is learnable from single sentences (positive-class F1 $\approx$ 0.74 with calibrated thresholds). We then compare a presence-gated hierarchy to a direct multi-label classifier under matched compute, both based on DeBERTa-base and augmented with lightweight signals (prior-sentence context, LIWC-22/eMFD/MJD lexica, and topic features). The hierarchy does not outperform direct prediction, indicating that gate recall limits downstream gains. We also benchmark instruction-tuned LLMs - Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, and Qwen 2.5 7B - in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups and build simple ensembles; a soft-vote supervised ensemble reaches macro-F1 0.332, significantly surpassing the best single supervised model and exceeding prior English-only baselines. Overall, in this scenario, lightweight signals and small ensembles yield the most reliable improvements, while hierarchical gating offers limited benefit. We argue that, under an 8 GB single-GPU constraint and at the 7-9B scale, carefully tuned supervised encoders remain a strong and compute-efficient baseline for structured human value detection, and we outline how richer value structure and sentence-in-document context could further improve performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Penalizing Localized Dirichlet Energies in Low Rank Tensor Products</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14173</link><description>arXiv:2601.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study low-rank tensor-product B-spline (TPBS) models for regression tasks and investigate Dirichlet energy as a measure of smoothness. We show that TPBS models admit a closed-form expression for the Dirichlet energy, and reveal scenarios where perfect interpolation is possible with exponentially small Dirichlet energy. This renders global Dirichlet energy-based regularization ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization strategy based on local Dirichlet energies defined on small hypercubes centered at the training points. Leveraging pretrained TPBS models, we also introduce two estimators for inference from incomplete samples. Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise. Overall, TPBS models exhibit greater robustness to overfitting and consistently benefit from regularization, while neural networks are more sensitive to overfitting and less effective in leveraging regularization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14173v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A model of errors in transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14175</link><description>arXiv:2601.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the error rate of LLMs on tasks like arithmetic that require a deterministic output, and repetitive processing of tokens drawn from a small set of alternatives. We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions. Finally, we show how to construct prompts to reduce the error rate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14175v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReSearch: A Multi-Stage Machine Learning Framework for Earth Science Data Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14176</link><description>arXiv:2601.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Earth Science data from satellite observations, reanalysis products, and numerical simulations has created a critical bottleneck in scientific discovery, namely identifying relevant datasets for a given research objective.
  Existing discovery systems are primarily retrieval-centric and struggle to bridge the gap between high-level scientific intent and heterogeneous metadata at scale.
  We introduce \textbf{ReSearch}, a multi-stage, reasoning-enhanced search framework that formulates Earth Science data discovery as an iterative process of intent interpretation, high-recall retrieval, and context-aware ranking.
  ReSearch integrates lexical search, semantic embeddings, abbreviation expansion, and large language model reranking within a unified architecture that explicitly separates recall and precision objectives.
  To enable realistic evaluation, we construct a literature-grounded benchmark by aligning natural language intent with datasets cited in peer-reviewed Earth Science studies.
  Experiments demonstrate that ReSearch consistently improves recall and ranking performance over baseline methods, particularly for task-based queries expressing abstract scientific goals.
  These results underscore the importance of intent-aware, multi-stage search as a foundational capability for reproducible and scalable Earth Science research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14176v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Progressive self-supervised blind-spot denoising method for LDCT denoising</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14180</link><description>arXiv:2601.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning is increasingly investigated for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) image denoising, as it alleviates the dependence on paired normal-dose CT (NDCT) data, which are often difficult to acquire in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised training strategy that relies exclusively on LDCT images. We introduce a step-wise blind-spot denoising mechanism that enforces conditional independence in a progressive manner, enabling more fine-grained denoising learning. In addition, we add Gaussian noise to LDCT images, which acts as a regularization and mitigates overfitting. Extensive experiments on the Mayo LDCT dataset demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to, or better than, several representative supervised denoising methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14180v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IIR-VLM: In-Context Instance-level Recognition for Large Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14188</link><description>arXiv:2601.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) concerns distinguishing individual instances from one another, with person re-identification as a prominent example. Despite the impressive visual perception capabilities of modern VLMs, we find their performance on ILR unsatisfactory, often dramatically underperforming domain-specific ILR models. This limitation hinders many practical application of VLMs, e.g. where recognizing familiar people and objects is crucial for effective visual understanding. Existing solutions typically learn to recognize instances one at a time using instance-specific datasets, which not only incur substantial data collection and training costs but also struggle with fine-grained discrimination. In this work, we propose IIR-VLM, a VLM enhanced for In-context Instance-level Recognition. We integrate pre-trained ILR expert models as auxiliary visual encoders to provide specialized features for learning diverse instances, which enables VLMs to learn new instances in-context in a one-shot manner. Further, IIR-VLM leverages this knowledge for instance-aware visual understanding. We validate IIR-VLM's efficacy on existing instance personalization benchmarks. Finally, we demonstrate its superior ILR performance on a challenging new benchmark, which assesses ILR capabilities across varying difficulty and diverse categories, with person, face, pet and general objects as the instances at task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14188v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analyzing Far-Right Telegram Channels as Constituents of Information Autocracy in Russia</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14190</link><description>arXiv:2601.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how Russian far-right communities on Telegram shape perceptions of political figures through memes and visual narratives. Far from passive spectators, these actors co-produce propaganda, blending state-aligned messages with their own extremist framings. In Russia, such groups are central because they articulate the ideological foundations of the war against Ukraine and reflect the regime's gradual drift toward ultranationalist rhetoric. Drawing on a dataset of 200,000 images from expert-selected far-right Telegram channels, the study employs computer vision and unsupervised clustering to identify memes featuring Russian (Putin, Shoigu) and foreign politicians (Zelensky, Biden, Trump) and to reveal recurrent visual patterns in their representation. By leveraging the large-scale and temporal depth of this dataset, the analysis uncovers differential patterns of legitimation and delegitimation across actors and over time. These insights are not attainable in smaller-scale studies. Preliminary findings show that far-right memes function as instruments of propaganda co-production. These communities do not simply echo official messages but generate bottom-up narratives of legitimation and delegitimation that align with state ideology. By framing leaders as heroic and opponents as corrupt or weak, far-right actors act as informal co-creators of authoritarian legitimacy within Russia's informational autocracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14190v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Efficient Agents: Memory, Tool learning, and Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14192</link><description>arXiv:2601.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in extending large language models into agentic systems. While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies. Moreover, we discuss the key challenges and future directions, with the goal of providing promising insights.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14192v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Minimax Perspective on Almost-Stable Matchings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14195</link><description>arXiv:2601.14195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability is crucial in matching markets, yet in many real-world settings - from hospital residency allocations to roommate assignments - full stability is either impossible to achieve or can come at the cost of leaving many agents unmatched. When stability cannot be achieved, algorithmicists and market designers face a critical question: how should instability be measured and distributed among participants? Existing approaches to "almost-stable" matchings focus on aggregate measures, minimising either the total number of blocking pairs or the count of agents involved in blocking pairs. However, such aggregate objectives can result in concentrated instability on a few individual agents, raising concerns about fairness and incentives to deviate. We introduce a fairness-oriented approach to approximate stability based on the minimax principle: we seek matchings that minimise the maximum number of blocking pairs any agent is in. Equivalently, we minimise the maximum number of agents that anyone has justified envy towards. This distributional objective protects the worst-off agents from a disproportionate amount of instability. We characterise the computational complexity of this notion across fundamental matching settings. Surprisingly, even very modest guarantees prove computationally intractable: we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists in which no agent is in more than one blocking pair, even when preference lists have constant-bounded length. This hardness applies to both Stable Roommates and maximum-cardinality Stable Marriage. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms when agents rank at most two others, and present approximation algorithms and integer programs. Our results map the algorithmic landscape and reveal fundamental trade-offs between distributional guarantees and computational feasibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differentiated Pickup Point Offering for Emission Reduction in Last-Mile Delivery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14196</link><description>arXiv:2601.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pickup points are widely recognized as a sustainable alternative to home delivery, as consolidating orders at pickup locations can shorten delivery routes and improve first-attempt success rates. However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Local electrical impedance tomography via projections</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14198</link><description>arXiv:2601.14198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for approximately eliminating the effect that conductivity changes outside the region of interest have in electrical impedance tomography, allowing to form a local reconstruction in the region of interest only. The method considers the Jacobian matrix of the forward map, i.e., of the map that sends the discretized conductivity to the electrode measurements, at an initial guess for the conductivity. The Jacobian matrix is divided columnwise into two parts: one corresponding to the region of interest and a nuisance Jacobian corresponding to the rest of the domain. The leading idea is to project both the electrode measurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the span of a number of left-hand singular vectors for a suitably weighted nuisance Jacobian. The weighting can, e.g., account for the element sizes in a finite element discretization or to prior information on the conductivity outside the region of interest. The inverse problem is then solved by considering the projected relation between the measurements and the forward map, only reconstructing the conductivity in the region of interest. The functionality of the method is demonstrated by applying a reconstruction algorithm that combines lagged diffusivity iteration and total variation regularization to experimental data. In particular, data from a head-shaped water tank is considered, with the conductivity change in the region of interest mimicking growth of a hemorrhagic stroke and the changes outside the region of interest imitating physiological variations in the conductivity of the scalp.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convergence analysis and a novel Lagrange multiplier partitioned method for fluid-poroelastic interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14201</link><description>arXiv:2601.14201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a partitioned method for the monolithic formulation of the Stokes-Biot system that incorporates Lagrange multipliers enforcing the interface conditions. The monolithic system is discretized using finite elements, and we establish convergence of the resulting approximation. A Schur complement based algorithm is developed together with an efficient preconditioner, enabling the fluid and poroelastic structure subproblems to be decoupled and solved independently at each time step. The Lagrange multipliers approximate the interface fluxes and act as Neumann boundary conditions for the subproblems, yielding parallel solution of the Stokes and Biot equations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and validate the theoretical error estimate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14201v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Storage-Rate Trade-off in A-XPIR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14202</link><description>arXiv:2601.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the storage problem in an asymmetric $X$-secure private information retrieval (A-XPIR) setting. The A-XPIR setting considers the $X$-secure PIR problem (XPIR) when a given arbitrary set of servers is communicating. We focus on the trade-off region between the average storage at the servers and the average download cost. In the case of $N=4$ servers and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers with $K=2$ messages, we characterize the achievable region and show that the three main inequalities compared to the no-security case collapse to two inequalities in the asymmetric security case. In the general case, we derive bounds that need to be satisfied for the general achievable region for an arbitrary number of servers and messages. In addition, we provide the storage and retrieval scheme for the case of $N=4$ servers with $K=2$ messages and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers, such that the messages are not replicated (in the sense of a coded version of each symbol) and at the same time achieve the optimal achievable rate for the case of replication. Finally, we derive the exact capacity for the case of asymmetric security and asymmetric collusion for $N=4$ servers, with the communication links $\{1,2\}$ and $\{3,4\}$, which splits the servers into two groups, i.e., $g=2$, and with the collusion links $\{1,3\}$, $\{2,4\}$, as $C=\frac{1}{3}$. More generally, we derive a capacity result for a certain family of asymmetric collusion and asymmetric security cases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Copy-Trasform-Paste: Zero-Shot Object-Object Alignment Guided by Vision-Language and Geometric Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14207</link><description>arXiv:2601.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study zero-shot 3D alignment of two given meshes, using a text prompt describing their spatial relation -- an essential capability for content creation and scene assembly. Earlier approaches primarily rely on geometric alignment procedures, while recent work leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models to model language-conditioned object-object spatial relationships. In contrast, we directly optimize the relative pose at test time, updating translation, rotation, and isotropic scale with CLIP-driven gradients via a differentiable renderer, without training a new model. Our framework augments language supervision with geometry-aware objectives: a variant of soft-Iterative Closest Point (ICP) term to encourage surface attachment and a penetration loss to discourage interpenetration. A phased schedule strengthens contact constraints over time, and camera control concentrates the optimization on the interaction region. To enable evaluation, we curate a benchmark containing diverse categories and relations, and compare against baselines. Our method outperforms all alternatives, yielding semantically faithful and physically plausible alignments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rig-Aware 3D Reconstruction of Vehicle Undercarriages using Gaussian Splatting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14208</link><description>arXiv:2601.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspecting the undercarriage of used vehicles is a labor-intensive task that requires inspectors to crouch or crawl underneath each vehicle to thoroughly examine it. Additionally, online buyers rarely see undercarriage photos. We present an end-to-end pipeline that utilizes a three-camera rig to capture videos of the undercarriage as the vehicle drives over it, and produces an interactive 3D model of the undercarriage. The 3D model enables inspectors and customers to rotate, zoom, and slice through the undercarriage, allowing them to detect rust, leaks, or impact damage in seconds, thereby improving both workplace safety and buyer confidence. Our primary contribution is a rig-aware Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline specifically designed to overcome the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes. Our method overcomes the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes by integrating precise camera calibration, synchronized video streams, and strong geometric priors from the camera rig. We use a constrained matching strategy with learned components, the DISK feature extractor, and the attention-based LightGlue matcher to generate high-quality sparse point clouds that are often unattainable with standard SfM pipelines. These point clouds seed the Gaussian splatting process to generate photorealistic undercarriage models that render in real-time. Our experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our design choices are essential to achieve state-of-the-art quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InT: Self-Proposed Interventions Enable Credit Assignment in LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14209</link><description>arXiv:2601.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14209v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HALT: Hallucination Assessment via Latent Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14210</link><description>arXiv:2601.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be understood as a failure of faithful readout: although internal representations may encode uncertainty about a query, decoding pressures still yield a fluent answer. We propose lightweight residual probes that read hallucination risk directly from intermediate hidden states of question tokens, motivated by the hypothesis that these layers retain epistemic signals that are attenuated in the final decoding stage. The probe is a small auxiliary network whose computation is orders of magnitude cheaper than token generation and can be evaluated fully in parallel with inference, enabling near-instantaneous hallucination risk estimation with effectively zero added latency in low-risk cases. We deploy the probe as an agentic critic for fast selective generation and routing, allowing LLMs to immediately answer confident queries while delegating uncertain ones to stronger verification pipelines. Across four QA benchmarks and multiple LLM families, the method achieves strong AUROC and AURAC, generalizes under dataset shift, and reveals interpretable structure in intermediate representations, positioning fast internal uncertainty readout as a principled foundation for reliable agentic AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14210v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unification of Deterministic Higher-Order Patterns</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14211</link><description>arXiv:2601.14211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sound and complete unification procedure for deterministic higher-order patterns, a class of simply-typed lambda terms introduced by Yokoyama et al. which comes with a deterministic matching problem. Our unification procedure can be seen as a special case of full higher-order unification where flex-flex pairs can be solved in a most general way. Moreover, our method generalizes Libal and Miller's recent functions-as-constructors higher-order unification by dropping their global condition on variable arguments, thereby losing the property that every solvable problem has a most general unifier. In fact, minimal complete sets of unifiers of deterministic higher-order patterns may be infinite, so decidability of the unification problem remains an open question.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14211v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalization and Completeness of Stochastic Local Search Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14212</link><description>arXiv:2601.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Stochastic Local Search (SLS) heuristics into a unique formal model. This model has two key components: a common structure designed to be as large as possible and a parametric structure intended to be as small as possible. Each heuristic is obtained by instantiating the parametric part in a different way. Particular instances for Genetic Algorithms (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are presented. Then, we use our model to prove the Turing-completeness of SLS algorithms in general. The proof uses our framework to construct a GA able to simulate any Turing machine. This Turing-completeness implies that determining any non-trivial property concerning the relationship between the inputs and the computed outputs is undecidable for GA and, by extension, for the general set of SLS methods (although not necessarily for each particular method). Similar proofs are more informally presented for PSO and ACO.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14212v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Polarization: Opinion Mixing and Social Influence in Deliberation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14221</link><description>arXiv:2601.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deliberative processes are often discussed as increasing or decreasing polarization. This approach misses a different, and arguably more diagnostic, dimension of opinion change: whether deliberation reshuffles who agrees with whom, or simply moves everyone in parallel while preserving the pre-deliberation rank ordering. We introduce \opinion mixing, measured by Kendall's rank correlation (\tau) between pre- and post-deliberation responses, as a complement to variance-based polarization metrics. Across two large online deliberative polls spanning 32 countries (MCF-2022: n=6,342; MCF-2023: n=1,529), deliberation increases opinion mixing relative to survey-only controls: treatment groups exhibit lower rank correlation on (97%) and (93%) of opinion questions, respectively. Polarization measures based on variance tell a more heterogeneous story: controls consistently converge, while treated groups sometimes converge and sometimes diverge depending on the issue.
  To probe mechanisms, we link transcripts and surveys in a third event (SOF: (n=617), 116 groups) and use LLM-assisted coding of 6,232 discussion statements. Expressed support in discussion statements strongly predicts subsequent group-level opinion shifts; this correlation is amplified by justification quality in the statements but not by argument novelty. To our knowledge, we are the first to observe how different notions of argument quality have different associations with the outcome of deliberation. This suggests that opinion change after deliberation is related to selective uptake of well-reasoned arguments, producing complex patterns of opinion reorganization that standard polarization metrics may miss.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14221v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rerank Before You Reason: Analyzing Reranking Tradeoffs through Effective Token Cost in Deep Search Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14224</link><description>arXiv:2601.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research agents rely on iterative retrieval and reasoning to answer complex queries, but scaling test-time computation raises significant efficiency concerns. We study how to allocate reasoning budget in deep search pipelines, focusing on the role of listwise reranking. Using the BrowseComp-Plus benchmark, we analyze tradeoffs between model scale, reasoning effort, reranking depth, and total token cost via a novel effective token cost (ETC) metric. Our results show that reranking consistently improves retrieval and end-to-end accuracy, and that moderate reranking often yields larger gains than increasing search-time reasoning, achieving comparable accuracy at substantially lower cost.

Abstract: Respiratory sound analysis is a crucial tool for screening asthma and other pulmonary pathologies, yet traditional auscultation remains subjective and experience-dependent. Our prior research established a CNN baseline using DenseNet201, which demonstrated high sensitivity in classifying respiratory sounds. In this work, we (i) adapt the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) for respiratory sound analysis and (ii) evaluate a multimodal Vision-Language Model (VLM) that integrates spectrograms with structured patient metadata.
  AST is initialized from publicly available weights and fine-tuned on a medical dataset containing hundreds of recordings per diagnosis. The VLM experiment uses a compact Moondream-type model that processes spectrogram images alongside a structured text prompt (sex, age, recording site) to output a JSON-formatted diagnosis. Results indicate that AST achieves approximately 97% accuracy with an F1-score around 97% and ROC AUC of 0.98 for asthma detection, significantly outperforming both the internal CNN baseline and typical external benchmarks. The VLM reaches 86-87% accuracy, performing comparably to the CNN baseline while demonstrating the capability to integrate clinical context into the inference process. These results confirm the effectiveness of self-attention for acoustic screening and highlight the potential of multimodal architectures for holistic diagnostic tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning and Clustering for Interpretable Sepsis Treatment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14228</link><description>arXiv:2601.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in intensive care units, where timely and accurate treatment decisions can significantly impact patient outcomes. In this work, we propose an interpretable decision support framework. Our system integrates four core components: (1) a clustering-based stratification module that categorizes patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups upon ICU admission, using clustering with statistical validation; (2) a synthetic data augmentation pipeline leveraging variational autoencoders (VAE) and diffusion models to enrich underrepresented trajectories such as fluid or vasopressor administration; (3) an offline reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained using Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) with a lightweight attention encoder and supported by an ensemble models for conservative, safety-aware treatment recommendations; and (4) a rationale generation module powered by a multi-modal large language model (LLM), which produces natural-language justifications grounded in clinical context and retrieved expert knowledge. Evaluated on the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, our approach achieves high treatment accuracy while providing clinicians with interpretable and robust policy recommendations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MASCOT: Towards Multi-Agent Socio-Collaborative Companion Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14230</link><description>arXiv:2601.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have recently emerged as promising socio-collaborative companions for emotional and cognitive support. However, these systems frequently suffer from persona collapse--where agents revert to generic, homogenized assistant behaviors--and social sycophancy, which produces redundant, non-constructive dialogue. We propose MASCOT, a generalizable framework for multi-perspective socio-collaborative companions. MASCOT introduces a novel bi-level optimization strategy to harmonize individual and collective behaviors: 1) Persona-Aware Behavioral Alignment, an RLAIF-driven pipeline that finetunes individual agents for strict persona fidelity to prevent identity loss; and 2) Collaborative Dialogue Optimization, a meta-policy guided by group-level rewards to ensure diverse and productive discourse. Extensive evaluations across psychological support and workplace domains demonstrate that MASCOT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of up to +14.1 in Persona Consistency and +10.6 in Social Contribution. Our framework provides a practical roadmap for engineering the next generation of socially intelligent multi-agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KAGE-Bench: Fast Known-Axis Visual Generalization Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14232</link><description>arXiv:2601.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

Abstract: We propose Q-learning with Adjoint Matching (QAM), a novel TD-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that tackles a long-standing challenge in continuous-action RL: efficient optimization of an expressive diffusion or flow-matching policy with respect to a parameterized Q-function. Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14234v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stabilizer-Assisted Inactivation Decoding of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes with Erasures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14236</link><description>arXiv:2601.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a reduced complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoder for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes over erasures. Our decoder combines classical inactivation decoding, which integrates peeling with symbolic guessing, with a new dual peeling procedure. In the dual peeling stage, we perform row operations on the stabilizer matrix to efficiently reveal stabilizer generators and their linear combinations whose support lies entirely on the erased set. Each such stabilizer identified allows us to freely fix a bit in its support without affecting the logical state of the decoded result. This removes one degree of freedom that would otherwise require a symbolic guess, reducing the number of inactivated variables and decreasing the size of the final linear system that must be solved. We further show that dual peeling combined with standard peeling alone, without inactivation, is sufficient to achieve ML for erasure decoding of surface codes. Simulations across several QLDPC code families confirm that our decoder matches ML logical failure performance while significantly reducing the complexity of inactivation decoding, including more than a 20% reduction in symbolic guesses for the B1 lifted product code at high erasure rates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14236v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spatiotemporal Wildfire Prediction and Reinforcement Learning for Helitack Suppression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14238</link><description>arXiv:2601.14238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfires are growing in frequency and intensity, devastating ecosystems and communities while causing billions of dollars in suppression costs and economic damage annually in the U.S. Traditional wildfire management is mostly reactive, addressing fires only after they are detected. We introduce \textit{FireCastRL}, a proactive artificial intelligence (AI) framework that combines wildfire forecasting with intelligent suppression strategies. Our framework first uses a deep spatiotemporal model to predict wildfire ignition. For high-risk predictions, we deploy a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) agent to execute real-time suppression tactics with helitack units inside a physics-informed 3D simulation. The framework generates a threat assessment report to help emergency responders optimize resource allocation and planning. In addition, we are publicly releasing a large-scale, spatiotemporal dataset containing $\mathbf{9.5}$ million samples of environmental variables for wildfire prediction. Our work demonstrates how deep learning and RL can be combined to support both forecasting and tactical wildfire response.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14243v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] XR: Cross-Modal Agents for Composed Image Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14245</link><description>arXiv:2601.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval is being redefined by agentic AI, demanding multimodal reasoning beyond conventional similarity-based paradigms. Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) exemplifies this shift as each query combines a reference image with textual modifications, requiring compositional understanding across modalities. While embedding-based CIR methods have achieved progress, they remain narrow in perspective, capturing limited cross-modal cues and lacking semantic reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce XR, a training-free multi-agent framework that reframes retrieval as a progressively coordinated reasoning process. It orchestrates three specialized types of agents: imagination agents synthesize target representations through cross-modal generation, similarity agents perform coarse filtering via hybrid matching, and question agents verify factual consistency through targeted reasoning for fine filtering. Through progressive multi-agent coordination, XR iteratively refines retrieval to meet both semantic and visual query constraints, achieving up to a 38% gain over strong training-free and training-based baselines on FashionIQ, CIRR, and CIRCO, while ablations show each agent is essential.

Abstract: We present Soft Tail-dropping Adaptive Tokenizer (STAT), a 1D discrete visual tokenizer that adaptively chooses the number of output tokens per image according to its structural complexity and level of detail. STAT encodes an image into a sequence of discrete codes together with per-token keep probabilities. Beyond standard autoencoder objectives, we regularize these keep probabilities to be monotonically decreasing along the sequence and explicitly align their distribution with an image-level complexity measure. As a result, STAT produces length-adaptive 1D visual tokens that are naturally compatible with causal 1D autoregressive (AR) visual generative models. On ImageNet-1k, equipping vanilla causal AR models with STAT yields competitive or superior visual generation quality compared to other probabilistic model families, while also exhibiting favorable scaling behavior that has been elusive in prior vanilla AR visual generation attempts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14246v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249</link><description>arXiv:2601.14249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14249v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OmniTransfer: All-in-one Framework for Spatio-temporal Video Transfer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14250</link><description>arXiv:2601.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Videos convey richer information than images or text, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14250v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LightOnOCR: A 1B End-to-End Multilingual Vision-Language Model for State-of-the-Art OCR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14251</link><description>arXiv:2601.14251v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We study a one-shot identification analogue of rate-distortion for discrete classification under three resources: tag rate L (bits of side information stored per entity), identification cost W (attribute-membership queries per identification, excluding global preprocessing and amortized caching), and distortion D (misclassification probability). The question is to characterize achievable triples (L,W,D) when a decoder must recover an entity's class from limited observations. Zero-error barrier. If two distinct classes induce the same attribute profile, then the observation pi(V) is identical for both and no decoder can identify the class from attribute queries alone. Thus, if the profile map pi is not injective on classes, zero-error identification without tags is impossible (a zero-error feasibility threshold). Achievability and converse at D=0. With k classes, nominal tags of L = ceil(log2 k) bits enable O(1) identification cost with D=0. Conversely, any scheme with D=0 must satisfy L &gt;= log2 k bits (tight). Without tags (L=0), identification requires Omega(n) queries in the worst case and may incur D&gt;0. Combinatorial structure. Minimal sufficient query families form the bases of a matroid; the induced distinguishing dimension is well-defined and links to zero-error source coding via graph entropy. We illustrate implications for type systems, databases, and biological taxonomy.

Abstract: We present Motion 3-to-4, a feed-forward framework for synthesising high-quality 4D dynamic objects from a single monocular video and an optional 3D reference mesh. While recent advances have significantly improved 2D, video, and 3D content generation, 4D synthesis remains difficult due to limited training data and the inherent ambiguity of recovering geometry and motion from a monocular viewpoint. Motion 3-to-4 addresses these challenges by decomposing 4D synthesis into static 3D shape generation and motion reconstruction. Using a canonical reference mesh, our model learns a compact motion latent representation and predicts per-frame vertex trajectories to recover complete, temporally coherent geometry. A scalable frame-wise transformer further enables robustness to varying sequence lengths. Evaluations on both standard benchmarks and a new dataset with accurate ground-truth geometry show that Motion 3-to-4 delivers superior fidelity and spatial consistency compared to prior work.

Building on this capability, we develop a scalable pseudo-labeling pipeline for large-scale video matting and construct the Matting Anything in Video (MA-V) dataset, which offers high-quality matting annotations for more than 50K real-world videos spanning diverse scenes and motions. To validate the effectiveness of this dataset, we fine-tune the SAM2 model on MA-V to obtain SAM2-Matte, which outperforms the same model trained on existing matting datasets in terms of robustness on in-the-wild videos. These findings emphasize the importance of large-scale pseudo-labeled video matting and showcase how generative priors and accessible segmentation cues can drive scalable progress in video matting research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14255v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implicit Neural Representation Facilitates Unified Universal Vision Encoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14256</link><description>arXiv:2601.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for image representation learning are typically designed for either recognition or generation. Various forms of contrastive learning help models learn to convert images to embeddings that are useful for classification, detection, and segmentation. On the other hand, models can be trained to reconstruct images with pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses in order to learn a latent space that is useful for image generation. We seek to unify these two directions with a first-of-its-kind model that learns representations which are simultaneously useful for recognition and generation. We train our model as a hyper-network for implicit neural representation, which learns to map images to model weights for fast, accurate reconstruction. We further integrate our INR hyper-network with knowledge distillation to improve its generalization and performance. Beyond the novel training design, the model also learns an unprecedented compressed embedding space with outstanding performance for various visual tasks. The complete model competes with state-of-the-art results for image representation learning, while also enabling generative capabilities with its high-quality tiny embeddings.

Abstract: End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has advanced significantly yet still struggles with rare and domain-specific entities. This paper introduces a simple yet efficient prompt-based biasing technique for contextualized ASR, enhancing recognition accuracy by leverage a unified multitask learning framework. The approach comprises two key components: a prompt biasing model which is trained to determine when to focus on entities in prompt, and a entity filtering mechanism which efficiently filters out irrelevant entities. Our method significantly enhances ASR accuracy on entities, achieving a relative 30.7% and 18.0% reduction in Entity Word Error Rate compared to the baseline model with shallow fusion on in-house domain dataset with small and large entity lists, respectively. The primary advantage of this method lies in its efficiency and simplicity without any structure change, making it lightweight and highly efficient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.06252v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advancing Minority Stress Detection with Transformers: Insights from the Social Media Datasets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02908</link><description>arXiv:2509.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising 12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital health interventions and public health policy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.02908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11594</link><description>arXiv:2601.11594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($\sigma^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11594v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Model Agent for User-friendly Chemical Process Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11650</link><description>arXiv:2601.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern process simulators enable detailed process design, simulation, and optimization; however, constructing and interpreting simulations is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This limits early exploration by inexperienced users. To address this, a large language model (LLM) agent is integrated with AVEVA Process Simulation (APS) via Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language interaction with rigorous process simulations. An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement. While current limitations such as oversimplification, calculation errors, and technical hiccups mean expert oversight is still needed, the framework's capabilities in analysis, optimization, and guided construction suggest LLM-based agents can become valuable collaborators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11650v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Agents Need Memory Control Over More Context</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11653</link><description>arXiv:2601.11653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in long, multi-turn workflows in both research and enterprise settings. As interactions grow, agent behavior often degrades due to loss of constraint focus, error accumulation, and memory-induced drift. This problem is especially visible in real-world deployments where context evolves, distractions are introduced, and decisions must remain consistent over time. A common practice is to equip agents with persistent memory through transcript replay or retrieval-based mechanisms. While convenient, these approaches introduce unbounded context growth and are vulnerable to noisy recall and memory poisoning, leading to unstable behavior and increased drift. In this work, we introduce the Agent Cognitive Compressor (ACC), a bio-inspired memory controller that replaces transcript replay with a bounded internal state updated online at each turn. ACC separates artifact recall from state commitment, enabling stable conditioning while preventing unverified content from becoming persistent memory. We evaluate ACC using an agent-judge-driven live evaluation framework that measures both task outcomes and memory-driven anomalies across extended interactions. Across scenarios spanning IT operations, cybersecurity response, and healthcare workflows, ACC consistently maintains bounded memory and exhibits more stable multi-turn behavior, with significantly lower hallucination and drift than transcript replay and retrieval-based agents. These results show that cognitive compression provides a practical and effective foundation for reliable memory control in long-horizon AI agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pigment Network Detection and Classification in Dermoscopic Images Using Directional Imaging Algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11674</link><description>arXiv:2601.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of melanoma, which can save thousands of lives, relies heavily on the analysis of dermoscopic images. One crucial diagnostic criterion is the identification of unusual pigment network (PN). However, distinguishing between regular (typical) and irregular (atypical) PN is challenging. This study aims to automate the PN detection process using a directional imaging algorithm and classify PN types using machine learning classifiers. The directional imaging algorithm incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), contrast enhancement, filtering, and noise reduction. Applied to the PH2 dataset, this algorithm achieved a 96% success rate, which increased to 100% after pixel intensity adjustments. We created a new dataset containing only PN images from these results. We then employed two classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bag of Features (BoF), to categorize PN into atypical and typical classes. Given the limited dataset of 200 images, a simple and effective CNN was designed, featuring two convolutional layers and two batch normalization layers. The proposed CNN achieved 90% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our CNN demonstrated superior performance. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed CNN model for effective PN classification, suggesting future research should focus on expanding datasets and incorporating additional dermatological features to further enhance melanoma diagnosis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11674v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FourierPET: Deep Fourier-based Unrolled Network for Low-count PET Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11680</link><description>arXiv:2601.11680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-count positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a challenging inverse problem due to severe degradations arising from Poisson noise, photon scarcity, and attenuation correction errors. Existing deep learning methods typically address these in the spatial domain with an undifferentiated optimization objective, making it difficult to disentangle overlapping artifacts and limiting correction effectiveness. In this work, we perform a Fourier-domain analysis and reveal that these degradations are spectrally separable: Poisson noise and photon scarcity cause high-frequency phase perturbations, while attenuation errors suppress low-frequency amplitude components. Leveraging this insight, we propose FourierPET, a Fourier-based unrolled reconstruction framework grounded in the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. It consists of three tailored modules: a spectral consistency module that enforces global frequency alignment to maintain data fidelity, an amplitude-phase correction module that decouples and compensates for high-frequency phase distortions and low-frequency amplitude suppression, and a dual adjustment module that accelerates convergence during iterative reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FourierPET achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters, while offering enhanced interpretability through frequency-aware correction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mobile-friendly Image de-noising: Hardware Conscious Optimization for Edge Application</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11684</link><description>arXiv:2601.11684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image enhancement is a critical task in computer vision and photography that is often entangled with noise. This renders the traditional Image Signal Processing (ISP) ineffective compared to the advances in deep learning. However, the success of such methods is increasingly associated with the ease of their deployment on edge devices, such as smartphones. This work presents a novel mobile-friendly network for image de-noising obtained with Entropy-Regularized differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on a hardware-aware search space for a U-Net architecture, which is first-of-its-kind. The designed model has 12% less parameters, with ~2-fold improvement in ondevice latency and 1.5-fold improvement in the memory footprint for a 0.7% drop in PSNR, when deployed and profiled on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Compared to the SOTA Swin-Transformer for Image Restoration, the proposed network had competitive accuracy with ~18-fold reduction in GMACs. Further, the network was tested successfully for Gaussian de-noising with 3 intensities on 4 benchmarks and real-world de-noising on 1 benchmark demonstrating its generalization ability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11684v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Efficient Image Deblurring for Edge Deployment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11685</link><description>arXiv:2601.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image deblurring is a critical stage in mobile image signal processing pipelines, where the ability to restore fine structures and textures must be balanced with real-time constraints on edge devices. While recent deep networks such as transformers and activation-free architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy, their efficiency is typically measured in FLOPs or parameters, which do not correlate with latency on embedded hardware. We propose a hardware-aware adaptation framework that restructures existing models through sensitivity-guided block substitution, surrogate distillation, and training-free multi-objective search driven by device profiling. Applied to the 36-block NAFNet baseline, the optimized variants achieve up to 55% reduction in GMACs compared to the recent transformer-based SOTA while maintaining competitive accuracy. Most importantly, on-device deployment yields a 1.25X latency improvement over the baseline. Experiments on motion deblurring (GoPro), defocus deblurring (DPDD), and auxiliary benchmarks (RealBlur-J/R, HIDE) demonstrate the generality of the approach, while comparisons with prior efficient baselines confirm its accuracy-efficiency trade-off. These results establish feedback-driven adaptation as a principled strategy for bridging the gap between algorithmic design and deployment-ready deblurring models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11685v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Modalities: Joint Synthesis and Registration Framework for Aligning Diffusion MRI with T1-Weighted Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11689</link><description>arXiv:2601.11689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal image registration between diffusion MRI (dMRI) and T1-weighted (T1w) MRI images is a critical step for aligning diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data with structural anatomical space. Traditional registration methods often struggle to ensure accuracy due to the large intensity differences between diffusion data and high-resolution anatomical structures. This paper proposes an unsupervised registration framework based on a generative registration network, which transforms the original multimodal registration problem between b0 and T1w images into a unimodal registration task between a generated image and the real T1w image. This effectively reduces the complexity of cross-modal registration. The framework first employs an image synthesis model to generate images with T1w-like contrast, and then learns a deformation field from the generated image to the fixed T1w image. The registration network jointly optimizes local structural similarity and cross-modal statistical dependency to improve deformation estimation accuracy. Experiments conducted on two independent datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in multimodal registration tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11689v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inter-Cell Interference Rejection Based on Ultrawideband Walsh-Domain Wireless Autoencoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11713</link><description>arXiv:2601.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel technique for rejecting partial-in-band inter-cell interference (ICI) in ultrawideband communication systems. We present the design of an end-to-end wireless autoencoder architecture that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver encoding/decoding in the Walsh domain to mitigate interference from coexisting narrower-band 5G base stations. By exploiting the orthogonality and self-inverse properties of Walsh functions, the system distributes and learns to encode bit-words across parallel Walsh branches. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we characterize how 5G CPOFDM interference maps into the Walsh domain and identify optimal ratios of transmission frequencies and sampling rate where the end-to-end autoencoder achieves the highest rejection. Experimental results show that the proposed autoencoder achieves up to 12 dB of ICI rejection while maintaining a low block error rate (BLER) for the same baseline channel noise, i.e., baseline Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) without the interference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AllShowers: One model for all calorimeter showers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11716</link><description>arXiv:2601.11716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient detector simulation is essential for modern collider experiments. To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11716v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lightweight Self-Supervised Detection of Fundamental Frequency and Accurate Probability of Voicing in Monophonic Music</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11768</link><description>arXiv:2601.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable fundamental frequency (F 0) and voicing estimation is essential for neural synthesis, yet many pitch extractors depend on large labeled corpora and degrade under realistic recording artifacts.

The resulting weights provide confidence scores that enable pseudo-labeling for a separate lightweight voicing classifier without manual annotations.

Abstract: Global sensitivity analysis of complex numerical simulators is often limited by the small number of model evaluations that can be afforded. In such settings, surrogate models built from a limited set of simulations can substantially reduce the computational burden, provided that the design of computer experiments is enriched efficiently. In this context, we propose an active learning approach that, for a fixed evaluation budget, targets the most informative regions of the input space to improve sensitivity analysis accuracy. More specifically, our method builds on recent advances in active learning for sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices and derivative-based global sensitivity measures, DGSM) that exploit derivatives obtained from a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. By leveraging the joint posterior distribution of the GP gradient, we develop acquisition functions that better account for correlations between partial derivatives and their impact on the response surface, leading to a more comprehensive and robust methodology than existing DGSM-oriented criteria. The proposed approach is first compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark functions, and is then applied to a real environmental model of pesticide transfers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11790v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion-Based Residual Anomaly Map for Resource-Efficient Glioma MRI Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11833</link><description>arXiv:2601.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\times$240$\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases. This model achieves post-processed Dice scores of 0.929 (WT), 0.856 (TC), and 0.821 (ET), with HD95 distances of 2.93, 6.78, and 10.35 voxels. These results are significantly better than the winning BraTS 2023 methodology for HD95 distances and WT dice scores. This demonstrates that a KLE-based residual anomaly map can dramatically reduce computational cost and data requirements while retaining state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11833v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Necessity of Cooperative Transmissions for Wireless MapReduce</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11844</link><description>arXiv:2601.11844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents an improved upper bound (achievability result) on the optimal tradeoff between Normalized Delivery Time (NDT) and computation load for distributed computing MapReduce systems in certain ranges of the parameters. The upper bound is based on interference alignment combined with zero-forcing. The paper further provides a lower bound (converse) on the optimal NDT-computation tradeoff that can be achieved when IVAs are partitioned into sub-IVAs, and these sub-IVAs are then transmitted (in an arbitrary form) by a single node, without cooperation among nodes. For appropriate linear functions (e.g., XORs), such non-cooperative schemes can achieve some of the best NDT-computation tradeoff points so far obtained in the literature. However, as our lower bound shows, any non-cooperative scheme achieves a worse NDT-computation tradeoff than our new proposed scheme for certain parameters, thus proving the necessity of cooperative schemes like zero-forcing to attain the optimal NDT-computation tradeoff.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11844v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Drift-Aware Predictive Transfer: Toward Durable Clinical AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11860</link><description>arXiv:2601.11860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical AI systems frequently suffer performance decay post-deployment due to temporal data shifts, such as evolving populations, diagnostic coding updates (e.g., ICD-9 to ICD-10), and systemic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing this ``aging'' effect via frequent retraining is often impractical due to computational costs and privacy constraints. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Adversarial Drift-Aware Predictive Transfer (ADAPT), a novel framework designed to confer durability against temporal drift with minimal retraining. ADAPT innovatively constructs an uncertainty set of plausible future models by combining historical source models and limited current data. By optimizing worst-case performance over this set, it balances current accuracy with robustness against degradation due to future drifts. Crucially, ADAPT requires only summary-level model estimators from historical periods, preserving data privacy and ensuring operational simplicity. Validated on longitudinal suicide risk prediction using electronic health records from Mass General Brigham (2005--2021) and Duke University Health Systems, ADAPT demonstrated superior stability across coding transitions and pandemic-induced shifts. By minimizing annual performance decay without labeling or retraining future data, ADAPT offers a scalable pathway for sustaining reliable AI in high-stakes healthcare environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11860v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerated MR Elastography Using Learned Neural Network Representation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11878</link><description>arXiv:2601.11878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To develop a deep-learning method for achieving fast high-resolution MR elastography from highly undersampled data without the need of high-quality training dataset. We first framed the deep neural network representation as a nonlinear extension of the linear subspace model, then used it to represent and reconstruct MRE image repetitions from undersampled k-space data. The network weights were learned using a multi-level k-space consistent loss in a self-supervised manner. To further enhance reconstruction quality, phase-contrast specific magnitude and phase priors were incorporated, including the similarity of anatomical structures and smoothness of wave-induced harmonic displacement. Experiments were conducted using both 3D gradient-echo spiral and multi-slice spin-echo spiral MRE datasets. Compared to the conventional linear subspace-based approaches, the nonlinear network representation method was able to produce superior image reconstruction with suppressed noise and artifacts from a single in-plane spiral arm per MRE repetition (e.g., total R=10), yielding comparable stiffness estimation to the fully sampled data. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using deep network representations to model and reconstruct MRE images from highly-undersampled data, a nonlinear extension of the subspace-based approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11878v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Impact of Circuit Depth versus Qubit Count on Variational Quantum Classifiers for Higgs Boson Signal Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11937</link><description>arXiv:2601.11937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), generate massive datasets that challenge classical computational limits. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers a potential advantage in processing high-dimensional data; however, finding the optimal architecture for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices remains an open challenge. This study investigates the performance of Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) in detecting Higgs Boson signals using the ATLAS Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 2014 experiment dataset. We implemented a dimensionality reduction pipeline using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to map 30 physical features into 4-qubit and 8-qubit latent spaces. We benchmarked three configurations: (A) a shallow 4-qubit circuit, (B) a deep 4-qubit circuit with increased entanglement layers, and (C) an expanded 8-qubit circuit. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing circuit depth significantly improves performance, yielding the highest accuracy of 56.2% (Configuration B), compared to a baseline of 51.9%. Conversely, simply scaling to 8 qubits resulted in a performance degradation to 50.6% due to optimization challenges associated with Barren Plateaus in the larger Hilbert space. These findings suggest that for near-term quantum hardware, prioritizing circuit depth and entanglement capability is more critical than increasing qubit count for effective anomaly detection in HEP data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11937v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NiMark: A Non-intrusive Watermarking Framework against Screen-shooting Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11978</link><description>arXiv:2601.11978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unauthorized screen-shooting poses a critical data leakage risk. Resisting screen-shooting attacks typically requires high-strength watermark embedding, inevitably degrading the cover image. To resolve the robustness-fidelity conflict, non-intrusive watermarking has emerged as a solution by constructing logical verification keys without altering the original content. However, existing non-intrusive schemes lack the capacity to withstand screen-shooting noise. While deep learning offers a potential remedy, we observe that directly applying it leads to a previously underexplored failure mode, the Structural Shortcut: networks tend to learn trivial identity mappings and neglect the image-watermark binding. Furthermore, even when logical binding is enforced, standard training strategies cannot fully bridge the noise gap, yielding suboptimal robustness against physical distortions. In this paper, we propose NiMark, an end-to-end framework addressing these challenges. First, to eliminate the structural shortcut, we introduce the Sigmoid-Gated XOR (SG-XOR) estimator to enable gradient propagation for the logical operation, effectively enforcing rigid image-watermark binding. Second, to overcome the robustness bottleneck, we devise a two-stage training strategy integrating a restorer to bridge the domain gap caused by screen-shooting noise. Experiments demonstrate that NiMark consistently outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods against both digital attacks and screen-shooting noise, while maintaining zero visual distortion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11978v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Kernel Approach for Semi-implicit Variational Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12023</link><description>arXiv:2601.12023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) enhances the expressiveness of variational families through hierarchical semi-implicit distributions, but the intractability of their densities makes standard ELBO-based optimization biased. Recent score-matching approaches to SIVI (SIVI-SM) address this issue via a minimax formulation, at the expense of an additional lower-level optimization problem. In this paper, we propose kernel semi-implicit variational inference (KSIVI), a principled and tractable alternative that eliminates the lower-level optimization by leveraging kernel methods. We show that when optimizing over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the lower-level problem admits an explicit solution, reducing the objective to the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD). Exploiting the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit distributions, the resulting KSD objective can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient methods. We establish optimization guarantees via variance bounds on Monte Carlo gradient estimators and derive statistical generalization bounds of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{n})$. We further introduce a multi-layer hierarchical extension that improves expressiveness while preserving tractability. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world Bayesian inference tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of KSIVI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12023v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link><description>arXiv:2601.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12029v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nonlinear Dynamic Factor Analysis With a Transformer Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12039</link><description>arXiv:2601.12039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper develops a Transformer architecture for estimating dynamic factors from multivariate time series data under flexible identification assumptions. Performance on small datasets is improved substantially by using a conventional factor model as prior information via a regularization term in the training objective. The results are interpreted with Attention matrices that quantify the relative importance of variables and their lags for the factor estimate. Time variation in Attention patterns can help detect regime switches and evaluate narratives. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the Transformer is more accurate than the linear factor model, when the data deviate from linear-Gaussian assumptions. An empirical application uses the Transformer to construct a coincident index of U.S. real economic activity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12039v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Koopman Spectral Computation Beyond The Reflexive Regime: Endpoint Solvability Complexity Index And Type-2 Links</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12044</link><description>arXiv:2601.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) of Koopman operator spectral computation in the information-based framework of towers of algorithms. Given a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X},d)$ with a finite Borel measure $\omega$ on $\mathcal{X}$ and a continuous nonsingular map $F:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$, our focus is the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}_F$ acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $p\in\{1,\infty\}$ for the computational problem \[ \Xi_{\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}}(F) :=\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}\!\bigl(\mathcal{K}_F\bigr), \] with input access given by point evaluations of $F\mapsto F(x)$ (and fixed quadrature access to $\omega$).
  We clarify how the $L^1$ case can be brought into the same oracle model as the reflexive regime $1&lt;p&gt;&lt;\infty$ by proving a uniform finite-dimensional quadrature compatibility, while highlighting the fundamentally different role played by non-separability at $p=\infty$.
  Beyond Koopman operators, we also construct a prototype family of decision problems $(\Xi_m)_{m\in\mathbb N}$ realizing prescribed finite tower heights, providing a reusable reduction source for future SCI lower bounds. Finally, we place these results deeper in the broader computational landscape of Type-2/Weihrauch theory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12044v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Irreversible Failure Reverses the Value of Information</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12046</link><description>arXiv:2601.12046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dynamic games with hidden states and absorbing failure, where belief-driven actions can trigger irreversible collapse. In such environments, equilibria that sustain activity generically operate at the boundary of viability. We show that this geometry endogenously reverses the value of information: greater informational precision increases the probability of collapse on every finite horizon. We formalize this mechanism through a limit-viability criterion, and model opacity as a strategic choice of the information structure via Blackwell garbling. When failure is absorbing, survival values become locally concave in beliefs, implying that transparency destroys equilibrium viability while sufficient opacity restores it. In an extended game where agents choose the information structure ex ante, strictly positive opacity is necessary for equilibrium survival. The results identify irreversible failure--not coordination, misspecification, or ambiguity--as a primitive force generating an endogenous demand for opacity in dynamic games.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12046v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A New Strategy for Artificial Intelligence: Training Foundation Models Directly on Human Brain Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12053</link><description>arXiv:2601.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While foundation models have achieved remarkable results across a diversity of domains, they still rely on human-generated data, such as text, as a fundamental source of knowledge. However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12053v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Offline Policy Learning with Weight Clipping and Heaviside Composite Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12117</link><description>arXiv:2601.12117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline policy learning aims to use historical data to learn an optimal personalized decision rule. In the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, reweighting-based methods (e.g., inverse propensity weighting or doubly robust estimators) are widely used to produce unbiased estimates of policy values. However, when the propensity scores of some treatments are small, these reweighting-based methods suffer from high variance in policy value estimation, which may mislead the downstream policy optimization and yield a learned policy with inferior value. In this paper, we systematically develop an offline policy learning algorithm based on a weight-clipping estimator that truncates small propensity scores via a clipping threshold chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in policy value estimation. Focusing on linear policies, we address the bilevel and discontinuous objective induced by weight-clipping-based policy optimization by reformulating the problem as a Heaviside composite optimization problem, which provides a rigorous computational framework. The reformulated policy optimization problem is then solved efficiently using the progressive integer programming method, making practical policy learning tractable. We establish an upper bound for the suboptimality of the proposed algorithm, which reveals how the reduction in MSE of policy value estimation, enabled by our proposed weight-clipping estimator, leads to improved policy learning performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12117v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Listen, Look, Drive: Coupling Audio Instructions for User-aware VLA-based Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12142</link><description>arXiv:2601.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Survey on 30+ Years of Automatic Singing Assessment and Singing Information Processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12153</link><description>arXiv:2601.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Singing Assessment and Singing Information Processing have evolved over the past three decades to support singing pedagogy, performance analysis, and vocal training. While the first approach objectively evaluates a singer's performance through computational metrics ranging from real-time visual feedback and acoustical biofeedback to sophisticated pitch tracking and spectral analysis, the latter method compares a predictor vocal signal with a target reference to capture nuanced data embedded in the singing voice. Notable advancements include the development of interactive systems that have significantly improved real-time visual feedback, and the integration of machine learning and deep neural network architectures that enhance the precision of vocal signal processing. This survey critically examines the literature to map the historical evolution of these technologies, while identifying and discussing key gaps. The analysis reveals persistent challenges, such as the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks, difficulties in reliably separating vocal signals from various noise sources, and the underutilization of advanced digital signal processing and artificial intelligence methodologies for capturing artistic expressivity. By detailing these limitations and the corresponding technological advances, this review demonstrates how addressing these issues can bridge the gap between objective computational assessments and subjective human-like evaluations of singing performance, ultimately enhancing both the technical accuracy and pedagogical relevance of automated singing evaluation systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12153v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Persistent Sheaf Laplacian Analysis of Protein Stability and Solubility Changes upon Mutation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12219</link><description>arXiv:2601.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic mutations frequently disrupt protein structure, stability, and solubility, acting as primary drivers for a wide spectrum of diseases. Despite the critical importance of these molecular alterations, existing computational models often lack interpretability, and fail to integrate essential physicochemical interaction. To overcome these limitations, we propose SheafLapNet, a unified predictive framework grounded in the mathematical theory of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) and Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL). Unlike standard Topological Data Analysis (TDA) tools such as persistent homology, which are often insensitive to heterogeneous information, PSL explicitly encodes specific physical and chemical information such as partial charges directly into the topological analysis. SheafLapNet synergizes these sheaf-theoretic invariants with advanced protein transformer features and auxiliary physical descriptors to capture intrinsic molecular interactions in a multiscale and mechanistic manner. To validate our framework, we employ rigorous benchmarks for both regression and classification tasks. For stability prediction, we utilize the comprehensive S2648 and S350 datasets. For solubility prediction, we employ the PON-Sol2 dataset, which provides annotations for increased, decreased, or neutral solubility changes. By integrating these multi-perspective features, SheafLapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across these diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that sheaf-theoretic modeling significantly enhances both interpretability and generalizability in predicting mutation-induced structural and functional changes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Provable Suboptimality of Momentum SGD in Nonstationary Stochastic Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12238</link><description>arXiv:2601.12238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While momentum-based acceleration has been studied extensively in deterministic optimization problems, its behavior in nonstationary environments -- where the data distribution and optimal parameters drift over time -- remains underexplored. We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AQUA-Bench: Beyond Finding Answers to Knowing When There Are None in Audio Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12248</link><description>arXiv:2601.12248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-aware large language models have shown strong performance on audio question answering. However, existing benchmarks mainly cover answerable questions and overlook the challenge of unanswerable ones, where no reliable answer can be inferred from the audio. Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12248v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepRAHT: Learning Predictive RAHT for Point Cloud Attribute Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12255</link><description>arXiv:2601.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regional Adaptive Hierarchical Transform (RAHT) is an effective point cloud attribute compression (PCAC) method. However, its application in deep learning lacks research. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end RAHT framework for lossy PCAC based on the sparse tensor, called DeepRAHT.

We also introduce the predictive RAHT to reduce bitrates and design a learning-based prediction model to enhance performance. Moreover, we devise a bitrate proxy that applies run-length coding to entropy model, achieving seamless variable-rate coding and improving robustness. DeepRAHT is a reversible and distortion-controllable framework, ensuring its lower bound performance and offering significant application potential. The experiments demonstrate that DeepRAHT is a high-performance, faster, and more robust solution than the baseline methods.

Abstract: Recently, deep learning has significantly advanced the performance of point cloud geometry compression. However, the learning-based lossless attribute compression of point clouds with varying densities is under-explored. In this paper, we develop a learning-based framework, namely DALD-PCAC that leverages Levels of Detail (LoD) to tailor for point cloud lossless attribute compression. We develop a point-wise attention model using a permutation-invariant Transformer to tackle the challenges of sparsity and irregularity of point clouds during context modeling. We also propose a Density-Adaptive Learning Descriptor (DALD) capable of capturing structure and correlations among points across a large range of neighbors. In addition, we develop a prior-guided block partitioning to reduce the attribute variance within blocks and enhance the performance. Experiments on LiDAR and object point clouds show that DALD-PCAC achieves the state-of-the-art performance on most data. Our method boosts the compression performance and is robust to the varying densities of point clouds. Moreover, it guarantees a good trade-off between performance and complexity, exhibiting great potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: We uncover a universal scaling law governing the dispersion of collective attention and identify its underlying stochastic criticality. By analysing large-scale ensembles of Wikipedia page views, we find that the variance of logarithmic attention grows ultraslowly, $\operatorname{Var}[\ln{X(t)}]\propto\ln{t}$, in sharp contrast to the power-law scaling typically expected for diffusive processes. We show that this behaviour is captured by a minimal stochastic differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion, in which long-range memory ($H$) and temporal decay of volatility ($\eta$) enter through the single exponent $\xi\equiv H-\eta$. At marginality, $\xi=0$, the variance grows logarithmically, marking the critical boundary between power-law growth ($\xi&gt;0$) and saturation ($\xi&lt;0$). By incorporating article-level heterogeneity through a Gaussian mixture model, we further reconstruct the empirical distribution of cumulative attention within the same framework. Our results place collective attention in a distinct class of non-Markovian stochastic processes, with close affinity to ageing-like and ultraslow dynamics in glassy systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12306v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Well Do LLMs Predict Human Behavior?

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to predict human behavior. We propose a measure for evaluating how much knowledge a pretrained LLM brings to such a prediction: its equivalent sample size, defined as the amount of task-specific data needed to match the predictive accuracy of the LLM. We estimate this measure by comparing the prediction error of a fixed LLM in a given domain to that of flexible machine learning models trained on increasing samples of domain-specific data. We further provide a statistical inference procedure by developing a new asymptotic theory for cross-validated prediction error. Finally, we apply this method to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find that LLMs encode considerable predictive information for some economic variables but much less for others, suggesting that their value as substitutes for domain-specific data differs markedly across settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12343v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Rotary Steering with Joint Autoregression for Robust Extraction of Closely Moving Speakers in Dynamic Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12345</link><description>arXiv:2601.12345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latest advances in deep spatial filtering for Ambisonics demonstrate strong performance in stationary multi-speaker scenarios by rotating the sound field toward a target speaker prior to multi-channel enhancement. For applicability in dynamic acoustic conditions with moving speakers, we propose to automate this rotary steering using an interleaved tracking algorithm conditioned on the target's initial direction. However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset. Real-world recordings complement these findings in complex scenarios with multiple speaker crossings and varying speaker-to-array distances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12345v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bone-conduction Guided Multimodal Speech Enhancement with Conditional Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12354</link><description>arXiv:2601.12354v1 Announce Type: cross

Our proposed model significantly outperforms previously established multimodal techniques and a powerful diffusion-based single-modal baseline across a wide range of acoustic conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12354v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Temporal Data and Short-Time Averages Improve Multiphase Mass Flow Metering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12433</link><description>arXiv:2601.12433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable flow measurements are essential in many industries, but current instruments often fail to accurately estimate multiphase flows, which are frequently encountered in real-world operations. Combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with accurate single-phase flowmeters has therefore received extensive research attention in recent years. The Coriolis mass flowmeter is a widely used single-phase meter that provides direct mass flow measurements, which ML models can be trained to correct, thereby reducing measurement errors in multiphase conditions. This paper demonstrates that preserving temporal information significantly improves model performance in such scenarios. We compare a multilayer perceptron, a windowed multilayer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) on three-phase air-water-oil flow data from 342 experiments. Whereas prior work typically compresses each experiment into a single averaged sample, we instead compute short-time averages from within each experiment and train models that preserve temporal information at several downsampling intervals. The CNN performed best at 0.25 Hz with approximately 95 % of relative errors below 13 %, a normalized root mean squared error of 0.03, and a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 4.3 %, clearly outperforming the best single-averaged model and demonstrating that short-time averaging within individual experiments is preferable. Results are consistent across multiple data splits and random seeds, demonstrating robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Purification Before Fusion: Toward Mask-Free Speech Enhancement for Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12436</link><description>arXiv:2601.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) typically improves recognition accuracy in noisy environments by integrating noise-immune visual cues with audio signals. Nevertheless, high-noise audio inputs are prone to introducing adverse interference into the feature fusion process. To mitigate this, recent AVSR methods often adopt mask-based strategies to filter audio noise during feature interaction and fusion, yet such methods risk discarding semantically relevant information alongside noise. In this work, we propose an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. This framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance. By reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions, our method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance. Experimental evaluations on the public LRS3 benchmark suggest that our method outperforms prior advanced mask-based baselines under noisy conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12436v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Mixture of Experts Vision Transformer for High-Fidelity Surface Code Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12483</link><description>arXiv:2601.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is a key ingredient for large scale quantum computation, protecting logical information from physical noise by encoding it into many physical qubits. Topological stabilizer codes are particularly appealing due to their geometric locality and practical relevance. In these codes, stabilizer measurements yield a syndrome that must be decoded into a recovery operation, making decoding a central bottleneck for scalable real time operation. Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints. Machine learning based decoders offer fast GPU inference and flexible function approximation, yet many approaches do not explicitly exploit the lattice geometry and local structure of topological codes, which can limit performance. In this work, we propose QuantumSMoE, a quantum vision transformer based decoder that incorporates code structure through plus shaped embeddings and adaptive masking to capture local interactions and lattice connectivity, and improves scalability via a mixture of experts layer with a novel auxiliary loss. Experiments on the toric code demonstrate that QuantumSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning decoders as well as widely used classical baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12483v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative AI as a Non-Convex Supply Shock: Market Bifurcation and Welfare Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12488</link><description>arXiv:2601.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of Generative AI (GenAI) constitutes a supply shock of a fundamentally different nature: while marginal production costs approach zero, content generation creates congestion externalities through information pollution. We develop a three-layer general equilibrium framework to study how this non-convex technology reshapes market structure, transition dynamics, and social welfare. In a static vertical differentiation model, we show that the GenAI cost shock induces a kinked production frontier that bifurcates the market into exit, AI, and human segments, generating a ``middle-class hollow'' in the quality distribution. To analyze adjustment paths, we embed this structure in a mean-field evolutionary system and a calibrated agent-based model with bounded rationality. The transition to the AI-integrated equilibrium is non-monotonic: rather than smooth diffusion, the economy experiences a temporary ecological collapse driven by search frictions and delayed skill adaptation, followed by selective recovery. Survival depends on asymmetric skill reconfiguration, whereby humans retreat from technical execution toward semantic creativity. Finally, we show that the welfare impact of AI adoption is highly sensitive to pollution intensity: low congestion yields monotonic welfare gains, whereas high pollution produces an inverted-U relationship in which further AI expansion reduces total welfare. These results imply that laissez-faire adoption can be inefficient and that optimal governance must shift from input regulation toward output-side congestion management.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12488v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Examples and counterexamples of injective types</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12536</link><description>arXiv:2601.12536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that, in univalent mathematics, type universes, the type of $n$-types in a universe, reflective subuniverses, and the underlying type of any algebra of the lifting monad are all (algebraically) injective. Here, we further show that the type of ordinals, the type of iterative (multi)sets, the underlying type of any pointed directed complete poset, as well as the types of (small) $\infty$-magmas, monoids, and groups are all injective, among other examples. Not all types of mathematical structures are injective in general. For example, the type of inhabited types is injective if and only if all propositions are projective. In contrast, the type of pointed types and the type of non-empty types are always injective. The injectivity of the type of two-element types implies Fourman and \v{S}\v{c}edrov's world's simplest axiom of choice. We also show that there are no nontrivial small injective types unless a weak propositional resizing principle holds. Other counterexamples include the type of booleans, the simple types, the type of Dedekind reals, and the type of conatural numbers, whose injectivity implies weak excluded middle. More generally, any type with an apartness relation and two points apart cannot be injective unless weak excluded middle holds. Finally, we show that injective types have no non-trivial decidable properties, unless weak excluded middle holds, which amounts to a Rice-like theorem for injective types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12536v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
